3/7/25 Dynasty Baseball Rundown

New March 7

Jung Hoo Lee - SFG, OF, 26.7 - I think we can officially say the shoulder looks healthy as Lee smoked his 2nd spring homer in 23 PA. He now has a 217 wRC+. His legs and base definitely look thicker to me this year, which makes sense, because when you hurt your shoulder, you might as well hit leg day harder. And the most exciting thing is that he's clearly out to add power this year, and it's working this spring with a 33.3% GB% and 66.7% Pull%. I hate that he hits in San Francisco, but other than that, I'm smelling a monster year for Lee.

Michael Soroka - WSH, RHP, 27.8 - 4 IP, 4 hits, 1 ER, 6/0 K/BB. The outings get longer, the lineups get realer-ish (about 70% of the Cardinals read lineup), and Soroka just gets on locking in that he is for real. The fastball was still sitting 94.6 MPH, up 1.1 MPH from 2024. The slider, which was a dominant, whiff machine pitch in 2024, is so legit with a 60% whiff%, and the sinker and changeup missed bats too, leading to a 41% whiff% overall. He now has a 1.29 ERA with a 37.5/4.2 K%/BB% in 7 IP. Really the biggest problem in 2024 for Soroka was his control (12.7% BB%), but he showed much better control when he first came up in the majors, and it sure looks damn good right now too. Both his slider and fastball were good pitches in 2024, and if he can maintain even some of this velo spike, they might be even better in 2025. And the sinker and change are showing signs of life too. I'm really starting to buy in here. Soroka is definitely a "star next to his name" player for me in the late rounds of drafts at this point.

Pete Crow-Armstrong - CHC, OF, 23.0 - The Crow is coming for that stolen base title. Just look how insanely fast this dude is, scoring from 2nd base on a passed ball. He also went 2 for 3 in this one with his 2nd stolen base. He's a legit game changer in every aspect of the game. I just love this kid.

Jac Caglionone - KCR, 1B, 22.2 - Jac looks like a new man this spring. He improved his plate approach in college, and after a weak pro debut, he's improving his plate approach in spring, putting up a 0/1 K/BB yesterday. He now has a 9.1/18.2 K%/BB% in 11 PA. Am I missing anything? Oh yea, he also utterly demolished his 2nd spring homer on a hanging meatball. He now has a 304 wRC+. If he ends up the best player from this FYPD class, it would be a surprise to nobody. What a beast.

Keibert Ruiz - WAS, C, 26.8 - Ruiz desperately needs a power breakout, and he showed signs of one yesterday, crushing two homers, one at 108.1 MPH and the other at 103.1 MPH. The elite contact skills are already there. The lift and pull is already there. We know catchers take longer to develop, and growing into more raw power at 26+ is something we see often. If he starts hitting the ball harder, which he did yesterday, he has legit explosion potential.

Gage Workman - CHC, SS/3B, 25.5 - Workman jacked out his 3rd spring homer and now has a 201 wRC+ with a 20/10 K%/BB% in 30 PA. Okay dude, now you are starting to play a little too well. Don't actually come for Shaw's Opening Day starting job (Shaw went 0 for 3). You are just supposed to be a fun backup plan who doesn't actually work out ;)

Shane McClanahan - TBR, LHP, 27.1 - 2.2 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 4/1 K/BB vs. the Phillies real lineup. The fastball sat 96.2 MPH and put up a 33% whiff%. The changeup and slider were whiff machines, leading to a 46% whiff% overall. I think we are pretty close to declaring McClanahan fully back and healthy. But these are still shorter outings, so we can't fully discount some rust popping up as he ramps up and stays ramped up. But I feel pretty close to just treating him fully back to his true ace days.

Mason Montgomery - TBR, Setup, 24.10/Pete Fairbanks - TBR, Closer, 31.3 - My favorite non closer target relative to price had his 3rd straight dominant outing, going 1 perfect inning with 2 K's. The 97.5 MPH fastball was untouchable with a 57% whiff%. And then Pete Fairbanks, everyone's least favorite closer, couldn't find the plate with 4 walks and 1 ER in 0.2 IP. The stuff was way down too, with the fastball down 2.3 MPH to 95 MPH. At this point, Fairbanks is tanking down my rankings. I don't see why they would give him any leash at all, and we know the Rays are fluid with roles to begin with. A Uceta/Montgomery closer committee might be looking like a real possibility right now, which would be insanely fun.

Jordan Romano - PHI, Closer, 31.11 - Romano is locking in that he is healthy this spring with his 3rd straight scoreless outing. The stuff is down with the fastball down 1.4 MPH to 95 MPH, and he didn't record any whiffs in this one, but it's still early March, and seeing him so effective is more important right now. He has a 30.8/0.0 K%/BB% in those 3 innings. I'm feeling more and more stable with him.

Craig Yoho - MIL, Setup, 25.5 - Even in my 30 team leagues, I'm not the type to roster minor league relief pitchers. I prefer to get my relievers from super small sample MLB pop ups, but Yoho is really making me rethink that strategy. At least for him in particular. He went 2 perfect innings with 4 K's yesterday and now has a 0.00 ERA with a 52.9/5.9 K%/BB% in 5 IP. This coming off a 42.4% K% in the minors in 2024. Here he is ripping off a disgusting breaker, and that isn't even his best secondary, it's the change. He's just super fun, and I'm getting drawn in.

Mikey Romero - BOS, 2B/SS, 21.3 - Romero might be one of the sneakiest really good prospects going right now, which is hard to accomplish as a former 1st round pick who just put up a 118 wRC+ in 16 games at Double-A as a 20 year old. You would think he would at least have moderate hype, but no. And he just keeps on jacking dingers this spring too, going 2 for 3 with a 103.9 MPH homer over David Sandlin and a 102.8 MPH homer off Chris Bassitt. Those are two legit pitchers, and the dinger was a grown man homer blasted out to left center. Sure he doesn't crush the ball, and sure the plate approach isn't great, but the guy knows how to lift and pull. He cracked 16 homers in 78 games last year. And he's still so young, so the EV should only rise from here. He's in a never ending logjam, and he has real deficiencies, but he should 100% be getting much more respect than he currently gets.

Dustin May - LAD, RHP, 27.7 - 3 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 3/2 K/BB vs. a mostly Quad-A Texas lineup. So I'm less impressed by the results, and more concerned with the down stuff. May was a guy who sat about 98 MPH on the 4-seamer and sinker when he was at his filthiest, and he only sat 95 MPH on them in this one. The curve put up a 67% whiff%, but he only had a 18% whiff% overall. I'm just struggling to get too excited about May right now. He's never really been a great K/BB guy, even in the minors. It was always about the pure filth, and he just doesn't seem that filthy anymore after the injuries. It also seems like he's the odd man out of the rotation. It's just not looking exciting for May right now.

Jackson Ferris - LAD, LHP, 21.3 - 2 IP, 3 hits, 2 ER, 5/0 K/BB vs. that same Texas lineup. Ferris needs a velocity bump to really hit that next level, and he showed he's capable of it in short outings, firing 96.2 MPH in this one. The slider was a devastating whiff machine with a 67% whiff% on 43% usage. If he can even maintain some of that velocity, the explosion can so easily come. Can't wait for him to be blocked in LA!

Ben Brown - CHC, RHP, 25.7 - 3.2 IP, 4 hits, 3 ER, 0 HR, 5/0 K/BB vs. a weak Kansas City lineup. No Statcast on this one and the lineup was too weak to really get too excited about the K/BB, but the filthy stuff was clearly on full display. Pitching Ninja clipped some of that filth. I have no idea if Brown can win this 5th starter job or not, but regardless, I'm still so in on him for Dynasty. He will get his shot eventually, and I will keep betting on a guy with his combination of stuff, strikeout rates, MLB success, and not really danger zone control. Keep buying.

Bo Naylor - CLE, C, 25.1 - The bounce back season is almost certainly coming for Bo. The great rookie year, sophomore slump, and then the year 3 bounce back is a tale as old as time. And Bo is coming for that tale with a 2 dinger day yesterday. He cracked one at 103.9 MPH off Ryne Nelson and the other at 98.3 MPH, but when you lift as much as Bo, you don't need to smoke them. The K rate has also been solid so far with a 14.3% K% in 21 PA.

Slade Caldwell - ARI, OF, 18.9 - We have a Slade Caldwall sighting for the first time in pro ball ... and we he went 0 for 1 with a K ... he now has a 100% K% this spring. And I thought you were supposed to be an elite contact guy ;)

Denzel Clarke - OAK, OF, 24.11 - 0 for 2 with 2 K's and now has a 46.7% K% in 15 PA ... okay, so maybe the strikeout issues aren't completely behind you yet

Juan Brito - CLE, 2B/3B, 23.6 - 0 for 3 with a K and now has a 38.9% K% with a 7 wRC+ in 18 PA ... just give the 2B job to Bazzana already

Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.3 - 1 for 4 with 0 K's ... it's a start ...
