Hitters 

Jackson Holliday - BAL, 2B, 21.4 - There always has to be one. Chourio was a beast. Langford was really good and beasted at the end of the season. Merrill exceeded all expectations all year. Caminero showed flashes and laid a solid foundation. And then there was Holliday, who had a nightmare rookie year. He slashed .189/.255/.311 with 5 homers, 4 steals, and a 33.2/7.2 K%/BB% in 60 games. The .262 xwOBA backs up the terrible surface stats. To continue with the bad, just to get it all out of my system, his bat speed also wasn't very impressive with a 71.2 MPH swing that was very slightly below average. There are very real things to be concerned about, like the hit tool being bottom of the scale bad, because he doesn't necessarily have the biggest game power/base stealing to truly make up for that. It's possible for prospects to bust, or have decent but unspectacular careers, even elite ones who feel can't miss. Now having said that, I'm not even close to giving up on Holliday. Even with the extreme struggles, he put up a very good 8.2% Barrel% and 89.3/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV. Hitting the ball that hard as a 20 year old is impressive. He's also lightning fast with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint, and he had an above average 27.2% Chase%, so it's not like he was completely lost up there. His hit tool has been very strong at every stop of the minors, so a 33.9% whiff% as a 20 year old in his first taste of the majors really isn't that huge of a deal. It's almost certain to improve as he gains experience. Do I think his terrible season has his stock dropping a bit? Yes. But he's still a Top 50 dynasty asset for me, and I'm expecting a much better year 2. - 2025 Projection: 77/16/68/.247/.318/.411/18 Prime Projection: 98/25/83/.278/.360/.485/25

Colton Cowser - BAL, OF, 25.0 - I wish Cowser ran more and/or was a better base stealer (9 for 13 on the bases in 153 games), because then I would really love his profile. He didn't run all that much in the upper minors either, and it doesn't seem like we can count on much more than the 10 steals range. The reason I want to see more steals is because he also doesn't have a good enough hit tool to be a positive contributor in that category. He hit .242 with a 30.7% K% and he had a pretty significantly high K% throughout his minor league career too. The last negative is that he doesn't hit lefties well, and while I don't think he's going to be a platoon player as he's good on defense and he should only improve against them, it's definitely something to note. But the trifecta of what he does well is a very powerful trifecta. He crushes the ball with a 13.6% Barrel%, 90.5/95.6 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13 degree launch, and 46.1% Hard Hit%. It led to 24 homers. He gets on base with a strong plate approach, putting up a 9.3% BB% and 25% Chase%. And he has well above average speed with a 28.2 ft/sec sprint. He's going to do damage, and if it came with more steals (or a better BA), you could really fall in love here, but because it doesn't, it caps his upside enough to not get too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/82/.253/.338/.472/11

Jordan Westburg - BAL, 2B/3B, 26.1 - I've been saying that Mark Vientos was my best target call of 2024, but Westburg isn't far behind. I closed out his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "That is a pretty Teflon combination of skills to have. While Gunnar and Adley hog all the attention on the MLB level, and Holliday, Mayo, Basallo etc … hog all the attention on prospect lists, you should sneakily tip toe in there and steal Westburg from his current owner like a thief in the night." ... that teflon combination of skills I was talking about showed back up in 2024, and this time it unsurprisingly resulted in an excellent season with 18 homers, 6 steals, a 21.7% K% and 125 wRC+ in 107 games (he missed almost two months with a fractured hand but returned before the end of the season). He smokes the ball with a 11.8% Barrel%, 91.1/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch and 46.1% Hard Hit%. He has plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint, he gets the bat on the ball with a 21.7% K%, and he's an above average defender at 3B. The 4.9% BB% was low, but he doesn't have any major chase issues, so I'm not too concerned about that. Like Cowser, I don't love that he was only 6 for 9 on the bases. As much as I like the bat, that base stealing element is big to put the profile over the top, and it seems we can't really count on that. It prevents him from truly blowing up, but it doesn't prevent him from being a Top 100 dynasty asset. - 2025 Projection: 79/26/87/.269/.325/.473/9

Pitchers

Grayson Rodriguez - BAL, RHP, 25.3 - Grayson is an ace waiting to happen. He's not quite there yet, but as long as he stays healthy, it's basically a foregone conclusion, so if you can get any discount/fatigue price on him at all, I would jump on it. He leveled up in 2024 with a 3.86 ERA and 26.5/7.3 K%/BB% in 116.2 IP. The 96.1 MPH fastball notched a plus 26.9% K% and .325 xwOBA. The pitch got a bit unlucky, but it's a plus pitch. The plus changeup was his best and most used secondary with a 34.8% whiff% and .254 xwOBA. The slider wasn't that great, but it missed a lot of bats with a 36.1% whiff%, so I think it will be a good pitch long term. He also threw an average-ish curve. It all resulted in a 30% whiff%, which is elite for a starter, and the control was above average. Velocity, control, bat missing fastball, bat missing secondaries, diverse pitch mix, size  ... he has it all, and it was just starting to blossom last year until a lat injury (near the shoulder) ended his season on July 31st. It seemed he was healthy enough to be considered for the post-season, but Baltimore decided to play it safe. All pitchers are risky, so I'm inclined to use the injury as another chance to buy at a small discount. He won't come cheap and there might not be any discount on him at all, so maybe the real takeaway here is that if you own him already, don't be the one to sell even slightly low and then come to regret it. - 2025 Projection: 14/3.48/1.17/197 in 170 IP

Bullpen

Felix Bautista - BAL, Closer, 29.9 - Bautista underwent Tommy John surgery in October of 2023, and all signs seem to point to a smooth recovery process, so he should be good to go for 2025. If he is legitimately fully healthy, there is zero doubt that he is the elite of the elite with a 1.48 ERA and 46.4/11.0 K%/BB% in 61 IP in 2023. The 99.5 MPH fastball notched a 37.8% whiff% and the splitter was untouchable with a 60.2% whiff% and .113 xwOBA. As we've seen with pitchers coming back from Tommy John though, it is not a guarantee that they are actually 100% healthy. Sometimes everything is back but the control. Sometimes everything is back but the secondaries. Sometimes the velocity is a bit down. Sometimes there are setbacks. On a general dynasty ranking, I think factoring in some of that risk is the right play, but for your personal dynasty team, if you want to just assume he will be fully healthy and elite, I have no problem with that. He was also so insanely good, that if he takes a step back, he could still be the best closer in baseball. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.95/0.98/88/32 saves in 60 IP

Baltimore Orioles 2025 Top 10 Fantasy Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Samuel Basallo - BAL, C/1B, 20.7 - Basallo didn't quite obliterate the upper minors like he did the lower minors, slashing .278/.341/.449 with 19 homers, 10 steals, and a 21.1/8.6 K%/BB% in 127 games, but when you take into account that he was 19 years old for the vast majority of the season, it gets a lot more impressive. He was also much better at Double-A with a 134 wRC+ in 106 games than he was at Triple-A (62 wRC+ with a 31.4% K% in 21 games), so I think we can give him a pass for an adjustment period with a new team, coaches, teammates, league, home park etc ... Even at Triple-A, the sweet lefty swinging, 6'4'' Basallo put up a 91.1 MPH EV. He's always put up solid contact rates in the minors, but the spike at Triple-A could also be an indicator that we shouldn't expect the highest BA at least early in his career. He puts the ball on the ground a decent amount, but with his type of double plus power, he's launch proof. I don't know where he fits in defensively with Adley behind the plate, and plenty of competition at 1B (Mayo and Mountcastle), but long term there seems to be plenty of room for all of them. He's a special power bat. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/35/.241/.300/.430/2 Prime Projection: 84/30/97/.268/.337/.505/6

2) Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - If you think Holliday had a bad MLB debut, get a load of this guy. Mayo was utterly lost at the dish with a .294 OPS and 47.8/8.7 K%/BB% in 46 PA. He had zero barrels with an 84.7 MPH EV and a 45.6% whiff%. It's a small sample, but I've seen a lot of poor debuts, and this one is up there with some of the worst, especially for a hyped up prospect. The debut was especially bad, but we've seen plenty of eventual studs have a terrible MLB debut. Just to use one example, Aaron Judge had a .179 BA with a 42.5% whiff% in his 95 PA debut (although it came with 4 homers and a .608 OPS), and he's been just fine. I don't want to put too much weight on the scary debut when Mayo has so many other things going him. His power is unquestionable at 6'5'', 230 pounds with 22 homers and a 90.7 MPH EV in 89 games at Triple-A. He swings a lightning quick bat with a double plus 74.1 MPH swing, and it's a relatively short swing too with a 7 foot length. His strikeout rates were also so much better in the minors with a 24.9% K% this year. He was getting sporadic playing time in the majors and doing a lot of pinch hitting, which is another reason to mostly ignore the MLB numbers. Is it in the back of my mind? Yea, I'm human. But I'm still treating him like an elite power hitting prospect. How clean of a path to playing time will depend on what Baltimore does this off-season, but it seems unlikely they just hand him a starting job out of the gate. - 2025 Projection: 46/16/59/.225/.302/.435/4 Prime Projection: 84/33/98/.249/.336/.512/6

3) Heston Kjerstad - BAL, 1B/OF, 26.1 - Baltimore didn't seem very interested in giving Kjerstad a real shot in 2024, but they were a very deep team who had World Series aspirations, so I understand not feeling pressure to truly break Kjerstad into the majors last year. But with Santander a free agent, and Baltimore generally not known as being big spenders (and if they do spend, they should almost certainly spend in their rotation), Kjerstad looks to be the favorite for the starting RF job on Opening Day. And he deserves it with an excellent season at both Triple-A and the majors. He smoked Triple-A with 16 homers, a 26.0/12.4 K%/BB%, and a 152 wRC+ in 56 games. It came with a 90.7 MPH EV and 16.8 degree launch. And then he was really good in the majors with 4 homers, a 116 wRC+ and 90.2 MPH EV in 114 PA. The swing and miss was on the high side with a 31.3% whiff% and 28.9% K%, but neither of those are too bad, and he also chased a lot with a 35% Chase%, so he needs to refine the plate skills, but that is to be expected with such little MLB experience. He's not a great defensive player, so he's definitely going to have to rake to hold down a job, but if he doesn't rake, it doesn't matter for us anyway. He's setting up to be a really good target this off-season with relatively subdued hype, because I love betting on the pedigree (2nd overall pick in the draft), history of production, opportunity, and hard hit ability. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/81/.250/.328/.444/3

4) Dylan Beavers - BAL, OF, 23.7 - Beavers doesn't have a clear path to a full time job right now, but beyond their starting lineup, and pending what they do this off-season, they really aren't that deep organizationally long term. Even short term there are bench jobs available for Beavers to force his way into the lineup at some point during 2025, and we all know injuries happen. He can play all 3 OF spots and is a pretty good defensive player. There is a reason Baltimore didn't use him as trade bait (yet). I think they like him a lot. There is going to be opportunity eventually, and he has the type of fantasy friendly skillset to go after. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 206 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that hits the ball hard and hits the ball in the air (15 homers with a 49.1% FB% in 119 games at Double-A). He's also fast with 31 steals. The hit tool isn't great with a .241 BA and 22.6/13.2 K%/BB%, but the high walk rates mitigate some of that, and he has the type of power/speed combo to survive a low BA. Beavers looks like a very enticing, not hyped to death fantasy target right now. He's a Top 100 prospect for me at the least, and just might crack my Top 75. - 2025 Projection: 17/5/21/.228/.297/.391/5 Prime Projection: 81/20/75/.247/.326/.430/24

5) Enrique Bradfield - BAL, OF, 23.4 - I talked about it in the Strategy Section of the Tampa Bay Rays Team Report, but Enrique Bradfield's profile just isn't one I go out of my way to roster. It's an extreme steals, extremely low power profile that just doesn't fit in with how I build my teams, but if this is a profile you like, Bradfield is a good one to go after. He proved everything will transfer to Double-A in the last 27 games of the season, slashing .287/.395/.396 with 1 homer, 15 steals, and a 11.7/12.5 K%/BB%. He's a good CF, the contact rates are excellent (although they weren't as good at High-A with a 16.6% K% in 81 games), he gets on base, and he's a demon on the bases. He's a CF version of Xavier Edwards, and with Cedric Mullins hitting free agency after this year, it wouldn't be crazy at all to see Bradfield winning the CF job in 2026 and beyond. - 2025 Projection: 19/0/7/.248/.298/.334/8 Prime Projection: 77/6/44/.278/.336/.369/43

6) Vance Honeycutt - BAL, OF, 21.10 - Selected 22nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Honeycutt is an elite athlete at 6'3'', 205 pounds with a plus to double plus power/speed combo (he went 28/28 in 62 games in the ACC) and plus CF defense. The only reason he even fell to 22nd, was because he is a strikeout machine with a 27.5% K%, and unfortunately, that risk was at the forefront in his pro debut with a 36.1% K% in 8 games at Single-A and a 55% K% in 5 games at High-A. The odds that he simply won't be able to hit MLB pitching nearly well enough to let his tools shine are quite high, but expecting the hit tool to be magically fixed in his first taste of pro ball was unrealistic. It was also a small sample. Let's see what Baltimore can do with him over a full off-season and season, because his upside is tremendously exciting. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 73/20/71/.223/.302/.428/17

7) Chayce McDermott - BAL, RHP, 26.7 - McDermott has always been talented at a very athletic 6'3'', 197 pounds with good stuff and big strikeout numbers, but his control/command has yet to take a step forward in his 4 year professional career with a 13.7% BB% in 100 IP at Triple-A. The stuff is quite good with a bat missing 93.7 MPH fastball, 3 plus, bat missing secondaries (slider, changeup, sweeper) and a solid curve too. It resulted in a 3.78 ERA with a 32.9% K%. Pitchers are notorious for having something click later in their career, so even at 26 years old, I don't think that is too old for a breakout considering the talent is still in here. One other complicating factor is that he went down with a shoulder injury after his July 30th start. He returned for one start at the end of the season where the velocity was down 2 ticks. He was probably just taking it easy, but it does tack on extra risk heading into the off-season. Baltimore has tons of opportunity is their rotation right now, so they have every reason to keep McDermott a starter for as long as possible, and he has the fantasy friendly upside to roster as a proximity arm in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.35/90 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.31/172 in 155 IP

8) Elvin Garcia- BAL, SS, 18.2 - Garcia was a talented international prospect who signed for half a million, and then he went out and produced in the DSL, slashing .294/.439/.505 with 1 homer, 12 steals and a 18.0/19.4 K%/BB% in 36 games. It was good for a 154 wRC+. He's a projectable 6'2'' and he didn't have any groundball issues, so the homer power should come in time, which he will combine with a good feel to hit, speed, and a good glove. With a good showing stateside, and with an uptick in power, he might have the highest real life prospect helium upside of anyone in this system outside of Mayo, Basallo, and Kjerstad. He's a good later round target if you can handle the risk. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 78/17/71/.266/.325/.421/23

9) Jud Fabian - BAL, OF, 24.6 - Fabian's contact rates always seem to be on the brink of total implosion before he brings them back off the ledge. He put up a 29.4% K% at Florida at 20 year old, before improving that to 22.3% in his age 21 season. He put up a 37.5% K% at Double-A in 2023, and then improved that in 2024 with a 29.9% K%. And then he got to Triple-A this year where he put up a 40.8% K% in 30 games, but we know how this story goes, and I'm expecting that to come down in 2025. Just how far down he can get it against MLB pitching is the ultimate question, and while it seems likely he will never be able to get it down quite enough, the power/speed/defense trifecta is good enough to roster him in medium to deeper leagues on the off chance he can. He jacked out 20 homers with 16 steals in 128 games, and he put up a 117 wRC+ at Double-A. He'll compete with Beavers and Bradfield for bench at bats/next man up status in 2025, and while my money is one Beavers or Bradfield, don't completely count out Fabian. - 2025 Projection: 11/3/16/.210/.289/.389/2 Prime Projection: 55/18/53/.228/.309/.429/11

10) Creed Willems - BAL, C/1B, 21.10 - Willems isn't a good defensive player, he chases a lot, and there is hit tool risk, so playing time is always going to be an issue, but if he does get his bat in the lineup, he's going to hit dingers. He has plus raw power and he gets to all of it with very high flyball rates, jacking out 13 homers in 82 games at High-A and 4 homers in 16 games at Double-A. It's a good sign that his K% didn't explode at Double-A with a 18.8% K% (20.9/10.7 K%/BB% at High-A), although it came with a 2.9% BB%. He's almost certainly going to need a trade to find a full time job, so he should be solid trade bait at the deadline. And if he ends up on a team who needs a power bat, Willems could fill that role. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/22/75/.238/.312/.441/2

11) Griff O'Ferrall BAL, SS, 22.2 - Selected 32nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Baltimore followed up their super risky pick of Honeycutt, with a super safe pick of O'Ferrall. Griff is a low upside college bat without much power, so while the real life profile of up the middle defense, contact, and some speed is enticing, it's less so for fantasy. He hit only 5 homers in 63 games in the ACC this year, and he hit only 8 homers in 186 career college games. He didn't hit a single homer in his 20 game pro debut in the lower minors. He did make a lot of contact with a 14.4% K% and he ran a bit with 2 steals in 6 attempts. The deeper the league, the more enticing he becomes, but even in deeper leagues I'm not super excited. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/9/58/.268/.324/.392/21

12) Stiven Martinez - BAL, OF, 17.8 - 

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Jumping off from the Griff O'Ferrall blurb, low upside college bats are by far the least interesting bucket of player in first year player drafts for me. College bats are old enough where you can't project very much upside on a player who has yet to show it. Even with hit tool first, lower upside high school bats you can dream of a possible power breakout in their age 19/20/21 year old season. With college bats, those seasons are already behind them, and the big power breakout didn't come. Not to say it's impossible to find untapped upside in your mid to late 20's, we certainly see it often, but it's not something to bet on when you are trying to strike gold. I always pack the back third of my FYPD Rankings with the mystery that is high priced international signings, and if your minor league system is deep enough, which it likely is if you are wading deep into the FYPD waters, why not take a shot on pure upside. Go for the high school bat or international prospect, even in deep leagues. You don't need nine million prospects. It's okay for a bunch of them to bust to clear out your system and then restock with the next group of lotto tickets. Because hitting on one of those lotto tickets, like Jesus Made, can be a franchise changer. Hitting on Griff O'Ferrall might not even leave a dent on your team.
