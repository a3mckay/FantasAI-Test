2/27/25 Dynasty Baseball Rundown

New
February 27

Liam Hendriks - BOS, Closer Committee, 36.2/Aroldis Chapman - BOS, Closer Committee, 37.1 - Hendriks pulls into the early lead for the closer role. Chapman did what Chapman does with 2 walks, 1 strikeout, and 0 ER in 0.2 IP. And then Hendriks stole the show, going 1 IP with 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 1/0 K/BB. He closed the outing with a fist pump. He's obviously excited to be back on the mound. Eric Balner was on the outing with a great tweet: "96 MPH fastball. The hit he conceded was to fellow Aussie Curtis Mead. “Clean inning and the only hit I gave up was to the stupid Australian,” laughed Hendriks." ... I mean, after that quote, I'm all in!

Curtis Mead - TBR, 2B/3B, 24.5 - Not only did Mead notch a hit over his countryman, but he demolished a no doubter for his first of the spring. He's been unconscious, going 8 for 9 overall, and he's also in the best shape of his life, adding 20 pounds this off-season. He doesn't seem to have a spot right now, but he could easily push Aranda for DH at bats, and he could be a rightly platoon option for multiple spots in the lineup. His contact and lift was solid in 2024, so if he really starts ripping the ball, a real breakout could definitely be on the table.

Sean Burke - CHW, RHP, 25.3 - Burke got the start against a lineup that featured Merrill, Bogaerts, and Cronenworth up top, and he just keeps on proving he's legit, going 2 IP with 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 2/1 K/BB. The fastball sat 95.6 MPH and the curve notched a 50% whiff%. Every time he takes the mound against MLB bats, he more than proves he belongs.

Noah Schultz - CHW, LHP, 21.8 - Speaking of proving they belong, Baby Johnson took the hill for the first spring outing of his career and went 1 IP with 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 0/0 K/BB. The sinker sat 97.3 MPH while mixing in a cutter, changeup and slider. He didn't miss any bats, but he notched a 38% Called strike+whiff%. Good luck hitting this guy.

Hagen Smith - CHW, LHP, 21.7 - Smith was up next for the Sox, and what Schultz lacked in whiffs, Smith made up for it, going 1 IP with 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 3/1 K/BB. He was a whiff machine with a 44% whiff% on the back of the slider. My goodness is that pitch nasty. The fastball sat 96.9 MPH. This was basically a taste of what he could look like out of the bullpen, but we want him starting.

Matt McLain - CIN, 2B/SS, 25.8 - I would say the shoulder looks pretty damn good. McLain exploded yesterday, going 3 for 3 with 2 doubles and a homer. I held strong on McLain, ranking him 65th overall, and a day like this makes me feel good about that decision.

Mike Trout - LAA, OF, 33.8 - The knee, back, calf, and wrist all look good! hah ... Trout ripped his first homer of the spring, and as long as he's in the box, he's going to rip homers. Hopefully the move to RF will keep him in that batter's box.

Jordan Lawlar - ARI, SS, 22.9 - Jordan Lawlar took out a year+ of frustration out on poor Tyler Anderson, demolishing his first spring homer at 105.8 MPH and then posturing as he watched it leave the park. This man needed a win. Let him have his moment. A healthy Lawlar could have the hype hitting all over again, and to be fair, nobody has dropped him too far down the rankings. Not one person is falling for the ole' out of sight, out of mind. He is very much in mind.

Andy Pages - LAD, OF, 24.4 - Kim's loss seems to possibly be Pages gain. The Dodgers recognize they have a good one here, and from the tea leaves I'm reading, it seems they want his bat in the lineup. And a big spring could force that issue, so I loved to see him crack his first spring bomb. Here is what I wrote in his Top 1,000 blurb: "He set a rock solid foundation to build on in his rookie year with a 10.7% Barrel%, 88.6 MPH EV, 20.8 degree launch, 28.3 ft/sec sprint, 73.1 MPH swing, .321 xwOBA, and a 26.1% whiff% in 116 games. That is a damn good collection of skills, and not very easy to find at all. If he had a full time job, I would be all over him, but it's hard to hype a guy up who simply doesn't have a job." ... and now that it seems there is a path for him, his value is on the rise.

Hye-seong Kim - LAD, 2B, 26.2 - Speaking of Kim, 0 for 3 with a K and is now 1 for 12 with 5 K's ... oof

Mitch Spence - OAK, RHP, 26.10 - I would hesitate to put too much stock into big velocity increases in short outings. We all know almost every pitcher is going to have a velocity increase in a bullpen role, but I still feel the need to mention Spence was up 2.7 MPH on his sinker to 94.6 MPH. The cutter, curve and slider were all up considerably too, and he pitched well, going 2 IP with 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 1/0 K/BB. He had a solid 25% whiff% overall, mostly dominating with the cutter. I'm not in on Spence, but if even half of those velocity gains are real, he could outdo my expectations for him. I'm probably too light on him.

Tomoyuki Sugano - BAL, RHP, 35.6 - Sugano did exactly what he said he was going to do in his first outing stateside, and that is throw the kitchen sink at you. He went 2 IP with 2 hits, 0 ER, and a 0/1 K/BB vs. Pitt's almost real lineup. He threw a 6 pitch mix with the splitter leading the way with a 25% usage and 50% whiff%. The 4-seamer only sat 92.1 MPH, but it was missing bats with a 50% whiff% (granted, only 1 for 2 on whiffs). The cutter, curve and sinker all induced weak contact. That is a crafty lefty playbook (except he's a righty). He seems right on track to be exactly who I thought he was. Good pitcher, but not enough strikeouts to be too exciting for fantasy.

Hunter Barco - PIT, LHP, 24.4 - The strikeout machine is back at it, striking out 2 with 1 walk and 0 ER in 1 IP. One was on a changeup, and one was on a 96 MPH fastball! He doesn't sit mid 90's, but he has the juice when he needs it. His season ended in late July with a leg injury just as he got to Double-A, and it put a halt to what could have been some really fun hype this off-season. I'm a big Barco fan, and think he can end up a high K, mid rotation starter.

Max Acosta - MIA, SS/2B, 22.5 - Max Acosta unloaded with a grown man's homer that most certainly looked the part of an MLB player. He smoked it at 103.4 MPH, and is now 2 for 4 on the spring. He's coming off a strong year at Double-A where showed off elite contact and speed, so if the power is ticking up, this could be a full on explosion here. He was once upon a time one of my top international prospect targets, but the power just wasn't showing up. Maybe now it is. He might get real exciting real quick into 2025.

Gabriel Rincones - PHI, OF, 24.1 - The 6'3'', 225 pound Rincones' power is absolutely not to be trifled with, and he put it to good use off Jose Berrios, slicing an opposite field shot that he didn't even get all of. That's his 2nd homer of the spring in 7 AB. He's terrible vs. lefties, so he might top out as a power platoon bat, but this is a major league athlete with major league power.

Garrett Mitchell - MIL, OF, 26.7 - Mitchell took Yamamoto out to deep center off a beautiful curveball. You already know. Jarren Duran 2.0.

Justin Crawford - PHI, OF, 21.3 - Justin Crawford launch watch ... 104.4 MPH, 15 degree single. Let's goooooo ;)

AJ Smith-Shawver - ATL, RHP, 22.4 - Shawver had a statement spring debut against a Quad-A Pitt lineup, going 2 IP with 2 hits, 0 ER, and a 3/0 K/BB. Here are the highlights of the dominance, and while the competition wasn't great, it's so easy to fall in love with the stuff. Atlanta clearly pushed Shawver to his limits early in his career, and he's still just 22 years old. The refinement might be coming this year, and he'll get his shot one way or the other eventually.

Michael McGreevy - STL, RHP, 24.9 - McGreevy was excellent in his MLB debut in 2024, and he rolled that right over into spring, going 2 IP with 0 hits, 0 ER, and a 2/0 K/BB vs. two thirds of the Yanks real lineup (no Judge though). The velocity was up a hair with the fastball sitting 93.6 MPH. It was only a 20% whiff% overall with a 92.3 MPH EV against, so I'm not exactly blown away, but he keeps on proving the elite control profile will play. He can certainly be a solid fantasy pitcher.

Will Warren - NYY, RHP, 25.2 - Warren was lights out against a 50/50 Cards lineup, going 3 IP with 0 hits, 0 ER, and a 3/0 K/BB. The 94 MPH fastball dominated with a 60% whiff% and the extremely high spin sweeper made Jordan Walker look frustrated up there. I'm kinda out on Warren, but it's possible I pulled the rip cord too early. There are definitely ingredients here for him to work with. I'm still not in, but I'm probably too low in the rankings.

Jo Adell - LAA, OF, 26.0 - 0 for 2 with a K and is now 0 for 9 on the spring ... nobody better to kick off the Bottom of the Rundown than Adell ...

Nolan Jones - COL, OF, 26.10 - 0 for 4 and is now 0 for 12 with 4 K's on the spring ... I mean, just one hit would be nice. Give us something

Jackson Holliday - BAL, 2B, 21.4 - 0 for 2 with a 1/1 K/BB and now has a .453 OPS with 3 K's in 7 PA ... I'm begging you to just get a few base knocks to get you off the Bottom of the Rundown. Please

Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - 0 for 3 with 2 K's and is now 1 for 11 on the spring ... I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed ...
