Before we get to my Predicting the 2026 Top 50 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings coming later this week, which is one of my favorite articles to write every year, I like to dive into the top of the 2026 First Year Player Draft Class because many of these guys will be popping up onto that list. It's also a good idea to start to understand exactly what you are trading away when people come sniffing around for your 2026 1st round pick. Ages are as of the 2025 MLB Draft (mid July). Here is the Top 10 2026 First Year Player Draft Rankings:

1) Jace LaViolette - SEC, OF, 21.8 - Obviously the game of baseball has been trending towards power hitters over contact hitters for a long time now, but it feels like we've truly hit a tipping point of late. Baseball was never really about the 6'6'' monsters. In fact, guys that tall would be fully discriminated against and dismissed because of their contact issues. Rarely would you find those guys at the very top of draft boards. Baseball was always the everyman's game, where it wasn't just about size, but times have most certainly changed. Now it's all about massive humans and massive EV's. Not to say the everyman still isn't valued (Bazzana and JJ got plenty of respect), but the massive human beings who dominated basketball and football are now fully bulldozing their way to the top of scouts lists in baseball too. I've been drooling over these guys from the second I started writing about dynasty, but it was always from a "better in fantasy than real life scenario." Not anymore. Now they are real life darlings too. Enter Jace LaViollette, who would have fit in nicely with last year's class of Condon and Jac. He's another 6'6'', behemoth with unspeakable power and speakable contact issues. He demolished 53 homers with a 25.4/18.7% K%/BB% in 138 career games in the SEC. He has a pretty simple lefty swing that simply mashes baseballs with double plus power to all fields, and he has no issues with lift. He's also a good athlete who can steal some bags and play a passable CF, although he's almost definitely a corner in the majors. Might there be a hit tool adjustment period in pro ball like we are seeing with Condon and Jac? Maybe, but I think he's better than both of those guys, and my bet is that there isn't going to be as much of adjustment period needed. It's not a no brainer, but he's my top dog in 2026 FYPD's. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/33/98/.259/.353/.503/9 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #35 - right after Nick Kurtz

2) Jamie Arnold - ACC, LHP, 21.4 - Nobody has loved funky lefty deliveries more than me since I've started writing in 2015/16. People honestly didn't even used to like them. But I say this because I'm not sure I've ever seen someone with a funky lefty delivery also look this smooth and athletic. Usually there is some violence, or control issues, or something. But Arnold's delivery looks as easy and repeatable as a guy doing the by the book, Mark Prior, overhand delivery. It's really remarkable to watch him pitch, and he has the filthy stuff to match. The fastball sits mid 90's with an elite movement profile, the slider is at least plus, and he's working on a splitter this year that looks dangerous. And he controls all of these pitches on a string. He put up a 2.98 ERA with a 35.4/5.8 K%/BB% in 105.2 IP his sophomore year, and he currently has a 0.000000000000 ERA with a 16/0 K/BB in 11 IP this season. He's definitely better than Hagen Smith, and while he might not have the true top end explosion of Chase Burns, he might be better than Burns too. I'm definitely all in on Arnold. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection:  15/3.29/1.03/235 in 190 IP Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #36 - right before Tink Hence, Quinn Mathews, Hagen Smith and Thomas White

3) Ethan Holliday - HS, SS, 18.5 - Ethan might be the first case of prospect fatigue for an 18 year old that hasn't even been drafted yet. His famous father and older brother has put so much focus on him for so long, that people are starting to focus on all of his negatives, rather than gushing about all of the positives. The big negative is that the hit tool isn't a finished product yet. There is swing and miss in his game. He hasn't showed out at showcase events and his lefty swing is definitely on the long side. It's fast, but it's not necessarily that blink of an eye, whip quick swing. We all know about the bloodlines, but Druw Jones had the bloodlines and he looked to part too, just like Ethan at 6'4'', and maybe Jones' struggles is in the back of my mind while evaluating Ethan. There were whispers about Jones' swing as well. Bloodlines aren't everything. Damn, maybe even I'm falling into the prospect fatigue trap, because we should all be celebrating this guy. The power is already plus and it could easily end up double plus. Yea, his tool/swing isn't a finished product, but he hasn't even played his senior year of high school yet, so let's give him a second to develop, and as Matt Holliday's kid, you gotta think it is just going to keep on improving. You know he will be getting the proper instruction at the least. This could be a plus hit/power bat at peak with more than a handful of steals. Which brings us to the final kinda negative for fantasy, which is that he isn't a burner. He's a really good athlete obviously, so who knows how much he's going to run in pro ball, but this isn't a Konnor Griffin type athlete. He's a power first high school prospect with some hit tool issues ... which maybe the bloodlines are pushing up his value more than if he had a different father. But I can't help but still fully buy in. His upside is too special to fade. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/30/95/.268/.344/.488/14 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #37 - right after Felnin Celesten and Konnor Griffin

4) Munetaka Murakami - JPN, 3B, 25.6 - It definitely feels as if Japanese pitchers coming stateside are much safer bets than when Japanese hitters come stateside, but the track record for Japanese hitters is starting to grow as well. Hideki Matsui was one of my favorite players during his time with the Yankees, Ohtani is the literal GOAT, Ichiro is a legend, Seiya Suzuki is damn good, and Masataka Yoshida ain't bad. That list is impressive. I would say the track record is pretty damn good. The one thing Murakami has that those guys didn't have though, is that he has major swing and miss in his game. He put up a 29.5% K% in 143 games in 2024. For comparison, Seiya had a 16.5% K% the year before he came over, and he just put up a 27.4% K% last year in the majors. Murakami really doesn't have the K rate to spare. Any step back at all against MLB pitching would put him into the hit tool bust range. It's pretty scary. But what he does well will translate to any league, and that is massive power. Here he is homering off Yu Darvish in BP a couple years ago. He jacked 56 homers in 2022, and he got ahold of 33 dingers last year. He's 6'2'', 213 pounds with a powerful lefty swing that hits out dingers to all fields. But even in Japan, it came with a .244 BA last year. Japan is the 2nd toughest league in the world, and we have seen enough of their superstars come stateside and continue to be excellent ballplayers. It's very possible he can do the same thing in MLB that he's doing in Japan. Do you have to factor in some hit tool bust risk? Sure, but the expectation should still be that he's going to hit for impact power no matter what continent he's on. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 79/28/88/.240/.325/.477/7 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #42 - right after Dalton Rushing and Cam Smith and before Lazaro Montes

5) Tyler Bremner - BigW, RHP, 21.3 - Let's start with a little Tyler Bremner changeup montage. That is straight filth, befuddling both lefty and righty batters. It's a true standout offering, but that is far from his only positive. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 190 pounds with an uber athletic righty delivery, and he has funk in it too with a three quarters arm slot delivery. Where Arnold is smooth as silk, including both his pitches and delivery, Bremner has maybe a tick more of that electric nastiness to his arsenal and delivery. The fastball is a mid 90's, bat missing weapon and the slider flashes plus. You already know about the double plus changeup, and the control is almost equally as good as Arnold's. It all resulted in a 2.54 ERA with a 30.2/6.1 K%/BB% in 88.2 IP his sophomore year. I prefer Arnold, but Bremner is not far off, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if he ended up the best pitcher in the class. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.39/1.10/205 in 180 IP Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #46 - right after Hagen Smith and Thomas White

6) Dean Curley - SEC, SS, 21.3 - A lot can change between now and the July Draft, because these player's seasons are just getting started, but it looks like Curley might be in for a monster junior year. He's already cracked 3 homers with a 2/8 K/BB in 7 games. This coming off an excellent season in 2024 where he slashed .288/.386/.502 with 12 homers, 9 steals in 10 attempts, and a 17.5/11.6 K%/BB% in 67 games. He was even better in the post-season, helping to lead Tennessee to a national championship in his first year in college ball. He's tooled up for days at 6'3'', 212 pounds with an athletic and easy righty swing that should produce plus power at peak, to go along with good athleticism. The feel to hit to there too. Curley checks a lot of boxes, and while there might not be one truly exceptional standout tool, he has a lot of really good ones. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/25/83/.261/.330/.453/12 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #88 - ranked around Zac Veen, Xavier Isaac, Brock Wilken, Cole Young, and Michael Arroyo

7) Kayson Cunningham - HS, SS, 19.1 - Damn, the little man discount ain't what it used to be. Cunningham used to be the type who would get all kinds of disrespect for only being 5'9'', but this class of prospect has just had too much success of late for them to continue to get underrated. Cunningham is getting rated correctly as one of the most exciting high school hitters in the class, size be damned. He has the Corbin Carroll, Jett Williams, Slade Caldwell profile to a T. Small, but damn explosive. The hit tool and contact are elite, the speed is plus, and the power is sneaky. I'm surprised to see him so high on all of the pre-draft rankings, but people evolve, and I guess the door might be slamming shut on getting major discounts on these guys. He's good, and everyone knows it. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 91/16/64/.286/.342/.425/28 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #146 - ranked around Slade Caldwell, Griffin Burkholder, Enrique Bradfield and Chandler Simpson

8) Cam Cannarella - ACC, OF, 21.10 - Cannarella is a tough one because a shoulder injury is complicating his evaluation. He played through a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder in 2024 which required surgery in July. We all know serious shoulder surgery which takes your rehab right up until the start of next season is not a recipe for a huge year. So it's possible Cannarella's 2025 won't really be a great indication of his actual upside, and we are seeing that right now with a .708 OPS and 7 K's in 6 games. He didn't steal a single bag in 2024 due to the shoulder injury after stealing 24 bags in 2023. The entire profile, including the injury complication is giving shades of JJ Wetherholt. The profile isn't identical though. Cannarella isn't necessarily the biggest guy at 6'0'', 180 pounds, but there is definitely room for him to tack on more mass. He already cracked 11 homers in 58 games in 2024, and the bat is quick, so he has present juice too. The speed and athleticism is plus, and he is a potentially plus CF, so the glove will get him on the field, and assuming a healthy shoulder, he should be a threat to steal 20-30 bags a year. And the hit tool and plate approach are both very good, hitting .358 with a 15/11.5 K%/BB% in 123 career games. Without the shoulder injury, who knows what kind of power breakout, or even better hit tool/approach we could have seen in his Junior year, but the injury is almost certainly going to complicate that. Maybe it can create a buying opportunity if he doesn't have the biggest junior year, but I'm hesitant to go higher than this right now. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/18/72/.265/.333/.431/25 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #170 - ranked around George Lombard, Edwin Arroyo, Matthew Lugo and Gavin Cross

9) Seth Hernandez - HS, RHP, 19.1 - Hernandez is the top high school pitching prospect in the class, but I can't lie, I see some similarities with Brock Porter. Both were on the old side for the class, both had absolutely humongous stuff with the changeup impressing the most, and both had some rawness in their deliveries. I spotted Porter's rawness immediately, and while Hernandez' delivery isn't as bad, I'm not sure it's the most athletic thing in the world. I bring this up first because I couldn't help but make the comparison, but that doesn't mean Hernandez is Porter, and that doesn't mean I don't love Hernandez. Because how can you not love a 6'4'', 195 pound fire breathing righty with mid to upper 90's heat, a double plus changeup, and a potentially plus slider. And just because I'm not in love with the delivery, doesn't mean that he's not an exceptional athlete. He's a two way player and would be a legit power hitting prospect as well if he wasn't so good on the mound. There is definitely some risk here and he's not a finished product, but the upside is straight elite. He deserves a spot in this Top 10, even for fantasy. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 13/3.55/1.20/200 in 180 IP Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #187 - ranked around AJ Smith Shawver, Yordanny Monegro, Luis Morales, Gary Gill Hill and Santiago Suarez

10) Marek Houston - ACC, SS, 21.3 - There is plenty of competition for this final spot, but let's give it a guy who looks to be in the midst of a junior breakout where he is improving the one area of his game that he needed to improve, power. Houston put on almost 20 pounds of muscle this off-season, and he didn't take long to show off the new power, crushing 4 homers in 8 games. He hit 8 homers in 54 games in 2024. He combines the newfound power with an excellent feel to hit (12.5% K% in 2024) and above average to plus speed. He's 6'3'', 205 pounds, so we are talking about a guy who looks the part too, and he's a good SS as well. If he can maintain these power gains, his stock is going to soar in 2025. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 83/17/71/.273/.337/.433/18 Where he would rank on the Top 500 Prospects Ranks: #215 - ranked around Cole Carrigg and Drew Gilbert
