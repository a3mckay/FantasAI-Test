Hitters

Jo Adell - LAA, OF, 26.0 - I feel crazy for even saying this, but I think Jo Adell is a target for me this off-season. I know, I know, even saying it out loud sounds downright silly, but hear me out. He just put up a .312 xwOBA in 130 games, which is nearly average, and he massively improved his contact rates with a 29.8% whiff% (38.5% in 2023) and 27.9% K% (40.3% in 2023). Nobody doubts his humongous talent, but just in case you need a reminder, his 76.7 MPH swing is 5th best in all of baseball. The names around him on that leaderboard are Stanton, Oneil Cruz, Schwarber, Judge, Chapman, Yordan, Ohtani, Julio, and Gunnar. The only qualified hitter in that area who wasn't good was Christopher Morel. If you lower the minimum qualification you will get more hit tool busts like Adell, but point being it shows off legit monster talent. And he has the EV to back it up with a 89.8/96.4 MPH AVG/FB EV. That FB EV is near elite. He also has plus speed with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint. He only hit .207 with a 90 wRC+ on the season, but he slashed .253/.341/.440 with 6 homers, 5 steals, and a 25.3/10.0 K%/BB% in his final 46 games before his season ended with an oblique injury. It can often take uber athletes into their mid to late 20's to figure out the hit tool, but when they do, it can pay off huge. It sure seems like Adell took a big step forward there in 2024. I know I'm going to end up regretting this, hah, but boy do I like Adell a lot right now relative to his perceived value. - 2025 Projection: 72/26/81/.237/.310/.449/15

Nolan Schanuel - LAA, 1B, 23.2 - I wasn't high on Schanuel this off-season because as you guys already know, hit tool/plate approach first guys without a big power/speed combo is just not my bag, and what Schanuel did in 2024 is why they aren't my bag. He hit 13 homers with 10 steals, 62 Runs, and 54 RBI in a full 607 PA. Even his .250 BA wasn't good, because often "hit tool" guys don't actually hit the ball hard enough to have a truly great hit tool. You need power for that too. His 86.1/89.2 MPH AVG/FB EV is super lackluster, he's slow as dirt with a bottom 24% sprint speed, and his 65.2 MPH swing was 5th worst amongst qualified batters. He's also not really a lift and pull guy with a 46.1% GB% and 40.4% Pull%. Now having said all that, this was his first full year of pro ball and he put up an above average 104 wRC+. That is pretty impressive. He's 6'4'', 220 pounds, so there is no way that there isn't more power in here if he ever decides to actually swing harder, which may or may not impact his elite contact rates (14.4% whiff%). He can certainly be a useful fantasy bat at peak, and there is some semblance of power upside purely because of his size, but you can't own everyone, and Schanuel is just not the type I ever own. - 2025 Projection: 79/15/68/.270/.356/.402/9

Pitchers

Jose Soriano - LAA, RHP, 26.6 - Everyone is focused on the Garrett Crochet and Reynaldo Lopez success stories of relievers being transitioned (back) into starters, and that allows Soriano to fly ever so quietly under the radar, putting him in perfect target territory. He put up a 3.42 ERA with a 20.7/9.6 K%/BB% in 113 IP. The K% isn't high, but he makes up for that with a negative 0.9 degree launch on the back of an elite 97.7 MPH sinker. It was the 4th most valuable sinker in baseball, behind only Wheeler, Skenes and Webb. That is heady territory right there. And it's not like he doesn't have an out pitch secondary with a plus to double plus curve that put up a 40.2% whiff% on 25.4% usage. He also throws a lesser used splitter (32.9% whiff% on 8.1% usage) and slider (46.3% whiff% on 5.5% usage), giving him 3 legit swing and miss secondaries. He put up a 36.2% whiff% in 42 IP out of the bullpen in 2023, so it's clear this guy has strikeout upside. And it's clear he has nasty stuff with elite ground ball rates. His excellent 2024 was not a fluke, and I think it's just the beginning. He reminds of a righty Framber Valdez before Valdez' control took a step forward, which is the last thing Soriano needs to do if he want to become a #2 fantasy starter. His season ended in mid August with arm fatigue, which isn't great, but it doesn't seem serious. I'm all systems go for Soriano this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.62/1.21/144 in 150 IP

Reid Detmers - LAA, LHP, 25.9 - How many times can you fall for the ole banana in the tailpipe trick? (does anybody actually still do this? Come to think of it, do cars even have tailpipes anymore?) Detmers' 3.86 xFIP with a 27.9/9.7 K%/BB% seems so enticing, and seems so juicy to call a target, but these were the same things to draw us in in 2023, and draw us in again at the start of 2024, and we know how that worked out. Not well. He had a 6.70 ERA in 87.1 IP and got demoted to Triple-A where he put up a 5.54 ERA in 78 IP. As discouraging as that is, we all know pitcher development is notoriously fickle, and it taking a young starter a few years before he really figures out how to put it all together, while showing flashes, isn't all that unusual. He has a good arsenal with a 93.8 MPH fastball that missed a lot of bats with a 25.3% whiff%, and his slider was plus with a .254 xwOBA and 36.8% whiff%. He rounds out the arsenal with a curve and change, both of which are below average. To my credit, I knew to be skeptical last off-season, finishing his Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "I like Detmers if he fell into my lap, but I think his perceived value is a bit too high for him to land in the target range for me." His perceived value has sunk like a stone, so I actually don't mind him at all as a later round flier. I think I may just end up with him on a few teams this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.05/1.31/168 in 150 IP

Bullpen

Ben Joyce - LAA, Closer, 24.7 - Joyce becoming the Angels closer was always his destiny since they selected him 89th overall, fast tracking him through the minors, and he now looks on the precipice of fulfilling that prophesy. They could easily sign a vet this off-season to take the role, but as of now, Joyce looks like the guy. He was in the process of locking down the job post trade deadline with 4 saves from August 3rd through September 3rd, but he then suffered a shoulder impingement which ended his season (it doesn't seem like it's serious). And we all know he most certainly has closer stuff, which is a understatement with a 102.1 MPH fastball that dominated MLB hitters with a .269 xwOBA and 29.8% whiff%. His 97.4 MPH sinker is dominant too with a negative 12 degree launch and 25.3% whiff%. The only thing keeping him out of the no doubt elite tier is that his slider isn't all that great. It put up a .339 xwOBA with a 32.1% whiff%, and it wasn't very good in 2023 either. His new changeup was actually really good with a 44.4% whiff%, but he only went to it 3.9% of the time, so maybe he develops that pitch more in 2025. It all resulted in a 2.08 ERA with a 23.2/9.9 K%/BB% in 34.2 IP. The 29% whiff% overall is much better than the K%, so I wouldn't be too worried about that. Control is his biggest problem, and it definitely adds some volatility to the profile, but not enough to scare me off. It would be premature to put him in the elite or even near elite closer range, but he so obviously has the talent to end up there. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.32/1.17/71/25 saves in 62 IP

Los Angeles Angels 2025 Top 10 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Christian Moore - LAA, 2B, 22.6 - Selected 8th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the Angels don't fuck around when it comes to promoting advanced college hitters to the majors, so you know Moore is going to be a contributor on your fantasy team real quick, possibly as soon as Opening Day. Shit, he almost made his MLB debut in 2024 with his absolute destruction of pro ball, slashing .322/.378/.533 with 5 homers, 2 steals, and a 29.6/8.2 K%/BB% in 23 games at Double-A. A knee injury (meniscus) is likely the only thing that stopped that from happening, but he returned to Double-A before the season ended and went 3 for 4 with a double and 4 RBI, so I wouldn't be worried about the knee. I fell in love with his personality during his Draft Day interview. It was the perfect mix of confident, cocky, thoughtful, playful and mature. That just seems like the type of infectious attitude I want on my team. He wasn't kidding when he said he had Champion in his blood. And of course, he was an absolute beast in the SEC, smashing 34 homers with a 1.248 OPS and 14.5%/11.3% K%/BB% in 72 games. He has a very strong righty swing at 6'1'', 210 pounds, producing at least plus power with average speed on the bases. In his freshman year in 2022, he put up a 1.062 OPS with 10 homers in 149 PA to give you an idea of the type of natural talent this is. As you saw with his K rate at Double-A, there are definitely some hit tool issues, which I'm not ignoring, but I'm also not letting it scare me off. I was high on Moore before his pro debut, and now I am over the moon for him. He ranked 4th overall on my End of Season Top 56 FYPD Rankings. - 2025 Projection: 70/23/77/.242/.310/.437/8 Prime Projection: 85/28/94/.260/.335/.481/10

2) Caden Dana - LAA, RHP, 21.4 - The Angels fast tracked the talented Dana through their farm system, because of course they did, and once again, it mostly paid off for them. With the right players, they are proving the strategy can definitely work. Dana spent the entire season at Double-A as a 20 year old and excelled with a 2.52 ERA and 27.4/7.3 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP. He then got a taste of the majors and struggled with a 9.58 ERA and 15.4/13.5 K%/BB% in 10.1 IP, but that is basically meaningless. He racked up an impressive amount of innings for a 20 year old, and that was at the end of a very long season. He most certainly looks the part at a rock solid 6'4'', 210 pounds. The fastball sat 93.7 MPH and it gets good movement with bat missing ability. There could also be another tick or 2 coming down the line. The slider is nasty and even in his rough MLB debut it performed well with a 37.5% whiff%. The lesser used changeup, curve and cutter all performed really well too with a 37.5%, 50%, and 66.7% whiff%, respectively. He has about average command of the entire arsenal. He showed off mid rotation upside in 2024, and that was as a 20 year old in the upper minors and the majors. If he can take a step forward this off-season with his arsenal and command, there could be yet another level in here. - 2025 Projection: 4/4.27/1.34/87 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.73/1.20/194 in 180 IP

3) George Klassen - LAA, RHP, 23.2 - The 22 year old Klassen got a little bit worse at every level as he climbed the minor league ladder. He put up a 0.71 ERA with a 39.6/8.3 K%/BB% in 38 IP at Single-A. A 4.22 ERA with a 35.2/9.9 K%/BB% in 21.1 IP at High-A. And then a 5.65 ERA with a 28.3/17.3 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP at Double-A. Age for level isn't as important for pitcher as it is for hitters, but I think Klassen is a good example for why it still needs to be taken into account. An older, more advanced pitcher can definitely have real advantages over less experienced hitters, which will make them look better than they really are. But the reason it doesn't matter as much for pitchers, is that stuff don't lie, and Klassen got that stuff. He throws a plus mid to upper 90's fastball, which he combines with a plus curve and a potentially plus hard slider/cutter. The control/command is below average, and it's not great how quickly he fell apart in his first taste of the upper minors, but it's hard not to fall in love with that stuff. He's a great proximity upside play with a soft landing spot as a high leverage reliever. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.33/1.36/61 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.79/1.28/182 in 165 IP

4) Matthew Lugo - LAA, OF, 23.10 - Lugo had a monstrous breakout at Double-A this season, slashing .315/.405/.664 with 11 homers, 9 steals, and a 21.1/11.7 K%/BB% in 43 games. It's also not the first time he's had a huge season. He had a big time year in 2022 as well. His numbers dropped off at Triple-A, but he still performed well with a 107 wRC+, 5 homers, 7 steals, and a 27.0/8.5 K%/BB% in 35 games. His raw power is currently below average with a 86.5 MPH EV, but there is still some projection on his frame at 6'1'', so that can easily tick up in his mid 20's, and best of all, he's a lift and pull machine, so he'll get the most out of his raw power. He also has good speed and went 16 for 17 on the bases in 79 total games. The hit tool is below average and the talent probably isn't quite big enough to just overlook that, but a lift and pull profile with speed is very fantasy friendly, and he's knocking on the door of the bigs. I'm starting to like Lugo a decent amount in medium to deeper leagues as proximity play. 2025 Projection: 21/5/28/.229/.290/390/3 Prime Projection: 76/19/74/.246/.313/.420/11

5) Joswa Lugo - LAA, SS, 18.2 - Lugo signed for $2.3 million in last year's international class with the big tools to back it up at 6'3'', and then he went out and impressed in the DSL, slashing .301/.370/.466 with 5 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.3/7.8 K%/BB% in 53 games. He has power potential written all over him with a smooth and quick righty swing that already packs a major punch. He had no groundball issues with a 35.3% GB%, so he should be able to get to all of his power at peak. He's also a really good athlete who is currently at SS, so while he's likely to fill out and slow down over time, he should be at least be a contributor in stolen bases, along with a possible asset with the glove (or at least not a total nothing). The biggest red flag is that the K/BB rates were pretty weak against DSL competition, so there is still a ton of risk present here, but if he performs well when he comes stateside, he has the type of talent that can explode in a hurry. He's one of my favorite DSL breakouts. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/26/86/.251/.321/.471/12

6) Nelson Rada - LAA, OF, 19.8 - Rada is a tough evaluation as an 18 year old at Double-A, but let's try to parse through the numbers and skillset. The one thing that is for sure is that he has impact speed and baserunning ability. He stole 27 bags in 50 games in the DSL in 2022, 55 bags at Single-A in 2023, and 35 bags in 123 games at Double-A this season. The hit tool and ultimate power projection isn't as easy. He hit .234 with a 23.3% K% this year, but considering how young he was for the level, that can be considered pretty impressive. The only year he was at an age appropriate level, 2022 in the DSL, he hit .311 with a 12.6% K%. As a 17 year old at Single-A he hit .276 with a 18.1% K%. This could easily end up being a plus hit tool at peak with an easy and simple lefty swing. He also has a very strong plate approach with a 11.4% BB% and .331 OBP. He was excellent in that department his entire career. He's a plus CF, so his glove will keep him on the field, and his speed gives him a decent floor for fantasy. It's not hard to see a potent top of the order hitter ... if he can do enough damage when he does make contact. He's had extreme groundball rates his entire career (56.6% this year), he doesn't hit the ball hard, and he's already a decently filled out 5'8''. He's hit just 4 homers in 288 career games and just 1 this season. That says more bottom of the order hitter than top of the order, but considering how young he is, I don't want to rule out a power uptick down the line. If he can just get to 10+ homer power, there is impact top of the order potential in here. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/8/57/.268/.332/.372/25

7) Ryan Johnson - LAA, RHP, 22.8 - Selected 74th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Johnson's delivery is so unique and weird, and not necessarily in a good way, but I think the true uniqueness gives him some extra intrigue to me. Different can add some unknown upside, and while most teams are probably risk averse and shy away from different, I go towards it when it comes at a steep discount. And weirdness is far from the only thing going for Johnson. He has the size, production and elite K/BB to back it up at 6'6'', 215 pounds with a 2.21 ERA and 35.9%/3.3% K%/BB% in 106 IP in Conference USA. The fastball sits 92-95 but can hit the upper 90's and the sweeper is a devastating pitch that he goes to often and racks up whiffs. He also throws a curve and change. If the Rays drafted him, I would feel so confident about naming Johnson a major target, but it's definitely a red flag that he lasted until 74th and got picked by the Angels. I always say you can't be too much of a slave to organization, so I'm not going to let it scare me off too much. I really really really like Johnson as a FYPD sleeper pick. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.95/1.26/165 in 160 IP

8) Sam Aldgheri - LAA, LHP, 23.7 - Aldegheri is likely a back end arm, but he's close to the majors (he's already made his MLB debut), and there is definitely enough in here to give him mid rotation upside. The fastball only sits 92.2 MPH, but it put up a 19.4% whiff% in the majors, which really isn't all that bad considering he was a 22 year old who jumped straight to the majors from Double-A. That tells me the low 90's fastball can definitely play, and he combines that with a plus slider that actually ate up MLB hitters, putting up a .091 xwOBA with a 38.5% whiff%. He also mixed in a below average changeup and below average curve. He wasn't good in the majors with a 4.85 ERA and 14.9/14.9 K%/BB% in 13 IP, but I'm actually impressed with the fastball/slider combo and pitch mix. He was also a K machine in the minors with a 3.59 ERA and 33.5/10.3 K%/BB% in 95.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. His K rate didn't dip in the upper minors, which is a big step. If he didn't have below average control, I might be willing to get really excited for him, but with below average control, I'm leaning a #4 as his reasonable upside. Improving his control, or his third pitch, or his velocity could easily take him up a notch. He's growing on me. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/79 in 85 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.32/151 in 150 IP

9) Trey Gregory-Alford LAA, RHP, 18.11 - Selected 322nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, but signing for $1.96 million, Alford has the size and stuff to match that big signing bonus. He's a built up 6'5'', 235 pounds with a mid 90's fastball that has been up to 101.4 in a bullpen session, which he combines with a potentially plus, but still developing slider. It's a reliever profile as is with below average control and without a third pitch, but he'll still be just 18 years old on Opening Day, so there is plenty of time for him to refine his arsenal and command. There is obviously a ton of risk here, but the upside is high too. He's likely to be one of the more interesting true upside arms that you will be able to get very late in first year player drafts. At the very least, keep an eye on him early in 2025, because his loud stuff will get people's attention quickly if he's pitching well. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/3.93/1.30/156 in 150 IP

10) Niko Kavadas - LAA, 1B, 26.6 - Kavadas is likely a very low BA, bench power bat, but his power is huge enough, and he's closer enough to the majors to crack this list. It's not hard to envision him becoming fantasy relevant if injuries hit, because the guy will rip dingers. He smoked 17 homers with a 92 MPH EV and 18.8 degree launch in 83 games at Triple-A, and then he hit 4 homers with a 91.7 MPH EV and 27.3 degree launch in 30 MLB games. He had a 33.4% K% at Triple-A and a 38.7% K% with a .183 BA in the majors, so the BA will tank you. He walks a ton though with a 17.3% BB% at AAA and 10.4% BB% in the majors, so in deep OBP leagues, he definitely has a chance to be useful. 2025 Projection: 23/8/26/.208/.309/.416/0

11) Dylan Jordan - LAA, RHP, 19.6 - Selected 143 overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, but signing for $1.25 million, Jordan has prototypical size at 6'3'', 200 pounds, and he has that three quarters arm slot, funky righty delivery which I definitely love, similar to Zander Mueth. It hasn't worked out fully for Mueth so far, but he still has plenty of time. As for Jordan, the fastball currently sits low to mid 90's which he combines with a potentially plus slider, but he needs to improve his changeup and control/command. Back end starter/reliever might be the most likely outcome, but there is obviously so much development time to go. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 8/4.24/1.33/126 in 140 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

I didn't plan on releasing my Angels team list on the same day that Fangraphs released their Angels list, but that is just how it fell. I actually love comparing and contrasting all of the different team lists that come out all around the same time. It's interesting to see how value can change drastically based on a real life list vs. fantasy list. And it's most interesting to see how each evaluator has their own biases, their own way of evaluating what a player will look like a few years down the line, and their own tools/skills/production which they weigh more or less heavily. In order to get the most value out of an evaluator's list, it's important to have some insight into their individual style. I definitely try to make it a point to let you in on that style. And you only have to have been reading me for like 5 minutes (see the above Schanuel blurb) to know my biases, which is power/speed upside for days, hit tool risk be damned. I could give the scouting report on other evaluators and list their biases, but I don't think that is my place. I will leave that up for you to decipher, and many of those other sources will also be clear about how they value certain things. So when you are looking at different lists, the ordinal number is only one part of the evaluation. Knowing why an evaluator may be higher or lower on a player due to how they lean in their evaluations can give better context into that ranking. I hope I convey that in my write-ups and projections, so regardless of where a player ranks, if you are looking for a certain profile (safety, hit tool, plate approach etc ...), you don't necessarily have to get caught up in a low ranking.
