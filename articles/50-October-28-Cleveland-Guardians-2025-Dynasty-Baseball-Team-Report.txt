*It's my birthday today (and I just found out I share a bday with CJ Kayfus!) and earlier than expected birthday festivities messed up my schedule for last week. We get back into Team Reports this week, and then next week I expand the Top 1,000 2025 Dynasty Rankings out to a Top 75. Deep Positional Rankings are also just around the corner.

Hitters

Jhonkensy Noel - CLE, OF, 23.8 - If you've been loving diving into the new bat speed data like I have, the first thing that smacks you right in the face is how elite Noel's bat speed is. Only Giancarlo Stanton and Oneil Cruz top his 78.1 MPH bat, and it's not a particularly long swing either. It's not short, but it's not in the territory to be concerned. And at 6'3'', 250 pounds, with that fast of a swing, bad things happen when he makes contact, smashing 13 homers with a 14.5% Barrel% and 19.3 degree launch in 67 MLB games. The flip side of swinging that hard and fast, is that it comes with a lot of missing the ball too with a 34.2% whiff% and 31.8% K%. He also seems to mostly close his eyes and just swing at anything with a 45% Chase%. He's bad on defense, and while he was good vs righties in the minors, he didn't hit them well in the majors (.683 OPS). He's big and he swings hard and that is about it, but we know that is all you need to make a big fantasy impact if your bat is in the lineup everyday. That last part isn't guaranteed though with Cleveland being pretty deep in corner/DH power bats. Why play Noel against a righty when you can play Kyle Manzardo? Or Will Brennan? or Chase DeLauter? Or George Valera? I wouldn't be overly concerned about it because if he mashes he will give them no choice, but he wasn't playing everyday down the stretch, and you have to at least have playing time problems in the back of your mind. - 2025 Projection: 71/27/83/.238/.311/.482/2

Kyle Manzardo - CLE, 1B, 24.8 - Manzardo struggled in his first taste of the bigs, putting up a .571 OPS in his first 30 games and then got sent back down. But he was a new man when he got called up again in September, smashing 5 homers with a .873 OPS in 23 games. He carried that over into the playoffs with a 138 wRC+ in 9 games. Manzardo has average to above average raw power with a good feel to hit, strong plate approach and a lift and pull profile. He didn't really standout in any one area against major league pitching (except the lift part with a 22.1 degree launch), but he wasn't bad in any area either with a 89.2 MPH EV, 27.6% whiff% and 27.7% Chase%. Considering this was his first go around, those numbers should only improve. He isn't going to wow you with bat speed or hard hit ability, but he hits the ball often enough, and with enough power, and at the right angles to put up some very impactful fantasy seasons. He's not good on defense and he struggled vs. lefties in the majors (.566 OPS), so a strong side of a platoon role is unfortunately still on the table as a possible outcome, but I don't think he's doomed to a part time role forever as he hit lefties better in the minors. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/79/.248/.321/.447/2

Pitchers

Tanner Bibee - CLE, RHP, 26.1 - Nothing is really off the charts or huge wow factor with Bibee. He is just really, really good across the board. He backed up his excellent rookie year in 2023 with an equally good season in 2024. He put up a 3.47 ERA with a 26.3/6.2 K%/BB% in 173.2 IP. His 94.6 MPH fastball put up a respectable 21.3% whiff%, his 86.5 MPH cutter is one of the best cutters in baseball with a 36.5% whiff% and +13 run value, his changeup and slider induce weak contact and miss bats, and he throws a decent curve too. His control/command leveled up into the plus area, which helps everything play up even further. He's not quite at true ace level, but he's really the perfect embodiment of a #2 starter. I feel like the #2 starter label often gets lost in the shuffle between "ace" and "mid-rotation" guy, but somebody has to slot in at a #2, and that man's name is Tanner Bibee. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.53/1.15/187 in 175 IP

Gavin Williams - CLE, RHP, 25.8 - Williams might be in a very nice buy low pocket of his career right now. He started the season on the IL with elbow discomfort, and it seemed like he could never really find that groove after debuting in early July. He put up a 4.86 ERA with a 23.8/9.6 K%/BB% in 76 IP, but the 4.14 xERA shows he got unlucky, and the fastball velocity was actually up a tick to 96.6 MPH. His curve and cutter both missed bats (30.4% whiff% and 34.1% whiff%) and put up solid xwOBA's (.241 and .277). None of his pitches are truly dominant and the control is below average, so this isn't a case where a big breakout is a foregone conclusion. He definitely needs to make improvements this off-season to his arsenal and command, but the raw ingredients and talent are in there to do that. He could be a reasonably priced target for a team in any part of the contention cycle (win now, rebuild, retool, stuck in the middle etc ...), but I would be careful about overpaying, as he still has good name value from his strong rookie year. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.79/1.28/160 in 150 IP

Bullpen

Cade Smith - CLE, Setup, 25.11 - Cade Smith had the most valuable 4-seam fastball in all of baseball last year. And that is not on a per pitch basis. That is overall, which is even more impressive for a reliever to hold the top spot there. And it also wasn't even close. That pitch put up a 28 run value while the next closest was Hunter Greene with 20. It resulted in an unreal season with a 1.91 ERA and 35.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 75.1 IP. He was almost even more impressive in the post season with a 3.60 ERA and 43.2/5.4 K%/BB% in 10 IP. He's obviously really good, but I'm not sure the underlying stats show him to be quite that good (which would be hard for anyone to maintain). The 30.2% whiff% is good, but not as good as the K rate, and none of his pitches put up more than a 30.4% whiff%. The splitter was an excellent pitch with a .231 xwOBA, but it only had a 29.9% whiff%, and the sweeper wasn't very good. He also got hit relatively hard with a 90.4 MPH EV and 8.4% Barrel% against. Hard to say he still isn't one of the top setup men to go after in 2025, but I don't know, I'm going to at least be keeping in mind that there could be some regression next year. - 2025 Projection: 5/2.84/0.96/94 in 70 IP

Cleveland Guardians 2025 Top 10 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Travis Bazzana - CLE, 2B, 22.7 - Selected 1st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bazzana looks like a tightly wound ball of kinetic energy that is just ready to explode in the box (I think ball of "Potential" energy is actually the correct scientific term, but I felt like "Kinetic" just hit harder :) ... There is toe tapping and bat wiggling before he absolutely uncoils on the baseball, jacking 28 homers in 60 games in the Pac 12 this year, and also smoking 6 homers with a 1.037 OPS in the wood bat cape cod league in 2023. He's "only" 6 feet tall, but there is easy plus power in here at the least. He combines the plus power with a near elite plate approach/hit tool (12.5%/25.7% K%/BB%), and speed (16 steals). He didn't standout in his pro debut, but he did enough to feel confident about him fulfilling his upside with 3 homers, 5 steals, a 126 wRC+ and 25.4/13.9 K%/BB% in 27 games at High-A. He's the total offensive package, and there is a reason he got taken #1 overall by a very smart franchise despite limited defensive value. The only thing that can stop him seems to be his parents. His parents almost ended his career before it started when celebrating. His dad tried to rip his arm out of his socket, and then his mom put him in some kind of neck hold into a tripping maneuver. Travis almost looked like he was about to square up with his mom for a second there. I guess they do things differently Down Under in Australia. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/31/.247/.319/.420/8 Prime Projection: 93/24/86/.275/.352/.466/25

2) Chase DeLauter - CLE, OF, 23.6 - I don't know if DeLauter needs to stop missing leg day at the gym, or by looking at the size of those trunks, maybe he needs to skip more leg days, but he has to figure out a way to keep the gams healthy. He broke his foot pre draft in 2022 which required surgery, and then he broke that same foot this year while running the bases. This one didn't require surgery and wasn't as serious, but at 6'3'', 235 pounds, those feet are going to continue to take a beating. He was able to return from the 2nd broken foot only to have a hamstring strain end his regular season about one month later. He's in the AFL now, so that also wasn't serious, but the injuries are starting to get concerning. They seemed to have stopped him from running at all this year with only 1 steal in 45 total games. The injuries haven't stopped him from raking though. The hit tool and plate approach look truly elite with a 13.4/11.6 K%/BB%, and he has big power with 7 homers in 36 upper minors games. One of those homers was an inside the park job, which showed off his athleticism. He's a special talent with above average to plus across the board skills, but he has to stay healthy, and staying healthy looks like it might entail not stealing a ton of bases, which does hurt the fantasy value a bit. - 2025 Projection: 66/19/72/.256/.320/.439/6 Prime Projection: 90/27/88/.278/.351/.484/10

3) Jaison Chourio - CLE, OF, 19.10 - Chourio gets plenty of love, but I'm not sure it's nearly enough. A lot of his love gets couched in "but he's not as good as his brother," which isn't quite fair, because I think there is near elite prospect upside in here, and he took steps towards that in 2024. His power didn't explode (yet), but it did tick up with 5 homers in 98 games at Single-A (1 homer was his previous career high). He's a still projectable 6'1'' with an explosive swing, so as he gains more raw power, and as he raises his launch (49.3% GB%), there could be a real power breakout coming down the line. And he has the elite plate skills (16.0/`19.9 K%/BB%) and speed (44 steals) to do the rest. He's yet to put up less than a 140 wRC+ at any stop of his career. This is easily a Top 30 fantasy prospect for me, and even that could be underselling him. If he gets lukewarm love in off-season prospect drafts where he's available, you need to jump all over that. Now is the time to target him aggressively. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 98/18/68/.276/.355/.433/34

4) Ralphy Velazquez - CLE, 1B, 19.10 - Velazquez was one of my top FYPD targets last off-season, ranking him 21st overall, and he more than delivered with a big season at Single-A. He cracked 10 homers with a 20.1/15.0 K%/BB% and 131 wRC+ in 82 games. He struggled when he got to High-A with a 54 wRC+ in 19 games, but considering he started the year as an 18 year old, that isn't a big deal. Cleveland moved him off catcher to 1B, which isn't surprising and is a good thing for fantasy. One of the reasons I loved him so much last off-season was because when a smart team takes a 1B prospect so high (23rd overall), you know they absolutely love the bat, and at 6'3'', 215 pounds with a smooth and powerful lefty swing, it's hard not to love his bat. He profiles as a classic middle of the order slugger. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/30/92/.258/.345/.500/6

5) Welbyn Francisca - CLE, SS, 18.10 - After getting lots of hype coming off his strong pro debut in the DSL, Francisca's hype seems to have quieted down to barely a whisper despite a very strong follow up season in 2024. He slashed .328/.418/.523 with 6 homers, 11 steals and a 12.4/12.4 K%/BB% in 45 games at stateside rookie ball, and then he went to full season ball as an 18 year old and didn't slow down, slashing .325/.402/.402 with 1 homer, 8 steals, and a 20.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 29 games. He's not a big guy at 5'8'', so power isn't expected to be a huge part of his game, but he can definitely pack a punch in that small frame. And keep in mind he will still be just 18 years old at the start of 2025. He's on pace to have one of the most enticing top of the order profiles in the minors, and I wouldn't completely sleep on his power either. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/16/61/.280/.346/.427/28

6) CJ Kayfus - CLE, 1B, 23.5 - Happy Birthday, CJ Kayfus! I just realized we have the same birthday! That has to be worth at least a few spots in the rankings ;) But you don't need to have the same birthday to appreciate the season Kayfus just had. He obliterated High-A (188 wRC+ in 40 games), and then he proved the skills will transfer to Double-A with 10 homers, a 139 wRC+ and 28.2/12.1 K%/BB% in 67 games. He has one of the sweetest lefty swings out there which helps his solid but not great raw power play up at 6'0'', 192 pounds. He's not an extreme lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull it. The strikeout rate jumping so high at Double-A is a little concerning, because he doesn't have big defensive value, and like I mentioned, the raw power isn't off the charts. He's a good 1B and he can play some corner outfield, so there is at lest some defensive value there. He has the type of bat you want to bet on, but Cleveland has a ton of competition for at bats at his positions, and his profile isn't bulletproof enough to completely overlook that. He's a fringy Top 100 prospect for me. - 2025 Projection: 16/5/19/.239/.308/.407/1 Prime Projection: 75/23/79/.252/.331/.447/6

7) Angel Genoa - CLE, SS, 20.10 - Genoa will rank higher on real life lists because he has a good glove at SS and a solid all around offensive game, but he's not nearly as exciting for fantasy. The reason I even have him ranked this high is because getting ranked highly on real life lists boosts fantasy trade value, whether rightly or wrongly, and having a good glove also gets you on the field. Opportunity and leash is a big factor for success, and Genoa's glove should give him that. And it's not like he's a zero on offense at all. He slashed .330/.379/.499 with 10 homers, 25 steals, and a 15.5/7.7 K%/BB% in 110 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's a 6 foot switch hitter who should get to average power at peak, and while he's not a burner, he should contribute in steals as well. He's a solid but unspectacular across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/17/74/.268/.323/.428/17

8) Daniel Espino - CLE, RHP, 24.3 - Sometimes you just gotta say eff it. If you said eff it with Kumar Rocker and held onto him, it would have paid off in a major way for you this year. Rocker had both shoulder and elbow surgeries. Granted, Espino's shoulder problems seem way more serious with him missing all of 2024 with another shoulder surgery. He hasn't pitched since 2022. But his stuff was so off the charts nasty with upper 90's heat, a plus slider, and a diverse pitch mix, that I think it's worth it to just say eff it. Maybe he's a shell of his former self. Maybe he keeps getting hurt. Or maybe he ends up in the bullpen. But on the off chance that his shoulder actually does get back to full health, he has the potential to Kumar Rocker the minors. From an afterthought to an elite, hyped pitching prospect in the blink of an eye. I'm going to hold on to see where it goes. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 3/3.81/1.29/65 in 60 IP

9) Juan Brito - CLE, 2B, 23.6 - Brito isn't a good defensive player and Cleveland has started to move him all over the field (1B, 2B, 3B, OF), which isn't a good sign because he doesn't really have that no doubt offensive upside either. But his season at Triple-A was too good to leave off this list. He slashed .256/.365/.443 with 21 homers, 13 steals, and a 16.1/13.5 K%/BB% in 144 games. The 87.3 MPH EV isn't great, but it's not terrible, and it came with a 17.5 degree launch and a 47% Pull%. We know that a strong plate approach with a lift and pull profile can most certainly work. If he can get into the lineup, he should be a rock solid MLB hitter, but his glove could cause problems on that front. 2025 Projection: 22/5/27/.241/.302/.394/2 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.259/.328/.430/8

10) George Valera - CLE, OF, 24.4 - Add Valera to the pile of Cleveland's strong corner depth. I don't know who is going to emerge out of this group, but at least a few of them will emerge over the next few years, and the ones that do can definitely make an impact. Valera had injuries slow his career and allowed others to catch up to him on the depth chart, so now he's in a dog fight like the rest of them. He had a strong year in 2024 with 17 homers, a 90.5 MPH EV and 27/12 K%/BB% in 90 games at Triple-A, showing off the power potential. He still has that damn smooth lefty swing. The best way to play Cleveland's fringier prospects are to probably wait to see who gets the opportunity, and then pounce, rather than hold on, but in deeper leagues you probably don't have that luxury. Something tells me that I still want to bet on Valera, but it will probably come as a strong side of a platoon bat. 2025 Projection: 15/6/21/.221/.301/.424/1 Prime Projection: 66/23/73/.245/.327/.469/6

11) Johnathan Rodriguez - CLE, OF, 25.5 - Good teams know how to build depth, and Cleveland is building strong offensive depth basically at every position. It's great for real life, but it makes it very hard to know if and when a good but not great prospect will get an opportunity. Rodriguez is in that bucket as a slugger with no defensive value. He destroyed Triple-A, slashing .301/.390/.540 with 29 homers, 8 steals, and a 25.2/12.6 K%/BB% in 118 games. The 7.2 degree launch was low, but the 92.5 MPH EV more than made up for it. He didn't have a good MLB debut in a small sample with a .486 OPS in 40 PA, but he still put up a 91.3 MPH EV. If he gets playing time, there is little doubt that he will be fantasy relevant, but who knows when or if he will get playing time. 2025 Projection: 18/6/24/.232/.307/.432/2 Prime Projection: 48/16/54/.244/.325/.457/ 5

Just Missed

12) Joey Cantillo CLE, LHP, 25.3 - If you want to move these next 3 pitchers to as high as 8th overall, I have no problem with that. The deeper the league where pitching is harder and harder to find, these guys would likely gain some value for me, even if I think a #4 starter is their reasonable upside.

13) Parker Messick - CLE, LHP, 24.5 

14) Matt Wilkenson - CLE, LHP, 22.4

15) Kahlil Watson - CLE, 2B/SS, 21.11

16) Luis Merejo - CLE, 1B, 18.9

17) Joey Oakie - CLE, RHP, 18.11 - Selected 84th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'3'', 205 pound Oakie is a sidearming righty with stuff that dashes and dives in every direction. The fastball sits low to mid 90's with tons of movement, the slider is a vicious pitch with at least plus potential, and he also has a developing changeup. The stuff is almost too nasty for his own good in that he doesn't seem to always know where it is going, so he will need to refine his control/command to remain a starter, but I love me a funky righty (Zander Mueth last year), and I like Oakie a ton this year. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.88/1.33/175 in 160 IP

18) Braylon Doughty - CLE, RHP, 19.4 -  Selected 36th overall in the 2025 MLB Draft, Doughty is a short righty at 6'0'', 196 pounds with a very easy and athletic delivery. He only throws low to mid 90's, and he isn't that projectable, but he can break off some absolutely nasty sliders and curves. The delivery also seems conducive to potentially plus control down the line. You gotta trust Cleveland when it comes to pitcher development, and while this doesn't seem like the highest upside arm, he has some of the best and crispest breaking stuff in the class. Adding more velocity and/or improving his control/command to plus or better can make him a legitimate impact starter. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.09/1.29/146 in 150 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

The Angel Genoa blurb reminded me of a question I got asked on my August Top 327 Prospects Rankings Update from Zach Alexander. He asked, "Do you ever feel pressure to rank guys highly that are rising on everyone else’s rankings?" And I thought my answer could give at least some insight into my thinking on a guy like Genoa, who I don't particularly love, but is also getting a solid amount of real life list love: "The short answer is yes, partially because trade value is a huge factor in dynasty when it comes to prospects especially, and arguably is more important than holding prospects, or at least equally important. So if someone is getting tons of hype that isn't my favorite type of profile to go after, I might not rank him as the high guy, but they still deserve a solid ranking. And also partially because I'm human and if a ton of sources I respect love a guy, there might be something there that I'm undervaluing. But overall, I 100% make an effort to rank with a mind of my own and that is something I've done from my very first ranking. And something I constantly preach which is to have a mind of your own and value prospects with a mind of your own especially. I have no issue being low on guys (like Gabriel Moreno when he was getting elite mainstream love), and especially love being high on underrated, underhyped guys. Hitting on underrated, under ranked studs is definitely my favorite part of the game (like Mark Vientos)." ... and beyond just ranking, this is also how I play the game. I won't reach for a guy getting lots of real life love, but if they drop far enough, I know that I should be able to get solid trade return on them down the line. So even if I like another prospect more than them, I still might pull the trigger for trade value alone.
