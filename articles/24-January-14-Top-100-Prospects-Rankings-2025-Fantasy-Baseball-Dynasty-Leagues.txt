Top 100 Prospects Rankings for 2025 Fantasy Baseball Dynasty Leagues

New
January 14

There will always be a warm place in my heart for the OG Top 100 Prospects Rankings (I do a full Top 500+ Prospects Rankings in very early February). I remember the good old days when if a prospect didn't crack a Top 100 Prospects Rankings, they were considered garbage. When a non Top 100 prospect used to break out on the MLB level, people's heads would explode on how such a "non" prospect could slip through the cracks. And as a writer, if you were able to identify a non Top 100 prospect who was actually good, you were hailed as one of the true geniuses of your time. Times have changed obviously, and now prospect lists can be never ending. A non Top 100 prospect used to be super deep and underrated. Now, a prospect has to be like a non Top 500 prospect to impress people. So before I drop the full Top 500 in a few weeks, let's lay down some roots with the OG Top 100. Here is the Top 100 Prospects Rankings for 2025 Fantasy Baseball Dynasty Leagues:

*I excluded Roki Sasaki from these rankings because I'm sick of putting him first on all of these prospects rankings when he's really not a prospect, but he would be first if I included him

1) Dylan Crews - WAS, OF, 23.1 - Crews' dynasty value/hype has seen some fluctuations since being drafted, but the thing that was quietly flying under the radar, was how good he was on the bases, and for fantasy, that has a major impact on his value. He stole 25 bases in 100 games in the upper minors, and then he stole 12 bags with a double plus 29.3 ft/sec sprint in his 31 game MLB debut. He only stole 6 bases in 71 games his junior year of college, and then went 3 for 7 in his pro debut, so I can't blame anyone for not expecting it, but it's clearly a real skill he has, and it makes Crews insanely exciting for fantasy again. He combines the speed with above average contact rates (19.7% K%), above average chase rates (26.6%), and plus power (94.7 MPH FB/LD EV in the majors and a 90.2 MPH EV in the minors). The only quibble in his profile is the low launch (8.8 degrees), but he has the skillset to make that work, and he only needs to raise it a bit higher to be in a completely fine range, which I'm betting he will. The Langford vs. Crews debate might not end up as easy as we thought, and with Crews not really being considered in that lofty tier anymore, there could be a buy window here this off-season. If you can buy off the relatively subdued hype and .641 MLB OPS, I would be all over it. He also has a lock on a full time job. He's my #1 prospect in baseball, and he just ranked 44th overall on A Top 200 Sneak Peek of the 2025 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings (Patreon). - 2025 Projection: 81/21/76/.259/.334/.448/26 Prime Projection: 94/27/97/.278/.359/.481/28

2) Jasson Dominguez - NYY, OF, 22.2 - The Yankees didn't want to unleash Dominguez in the majors lasty year, and his .617 OPS in the 67 PA he did receive isn't super impressive, but make no mistake, Dominguez is still on the superstar path. His 75.4 MPH swing is straight elite, which proves right there that his talent really wasn't that overhyped as an international prospect. His 23.4% whiff% was comfortably above average, which is pretty huge to see, and his 28.1% Chase% was slightly above average. Tack on plus speed, and Dominguez' beastly potential was even able to shine through despite the Yanks refusing to unleash him. And oh yea, he destroyed the upper minors immediately after returning from Tommy John surgery in mid May with a 135 wRC+, 11 homers, 16 steals (in 17 attempts) and a 20.0/8.8 K%/BB% in 58 games. Is he really 22 years old and not like 26 years old? Beats me. But I don't care when it comes to a talent this huge (I gave my thoughts on MLB cracking down on players' lying about their ages in the Philadelphia Phillies Dynasty Team Report). I see no reason why the Yanks won't unleash him immediately in 2025, and he could be on a beeline for elite dynasty asset status in short order. Go after him. - 2025 Projection: 83/21/76/.246/.323/.434/26 Prime Projection: 109/28/91/.266/.351/.487/34

3) Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.3 - Campbell possesses one of the most visually disgusting swings I have ever seen, and I mean that in the best way possible. It looks like he literally unhinges his shoulder to turn his body into a cannon, absolutely unfurling on the baseball. Here is what I wrote about a homer Campbell hit in early September in the in-season Dynasty Baseball Rundowns: "on his latest homer, I think he dislocated his shoulder with one of the most bad intentions swings I've seen."  Underscoring my visual evaluation of that explosive shoulder movement is that shortly after that homer he hit the IL with a lat strain, which is right under the shoulder blades. Campbell underwent a well documented swing change and bat speed training to unlock more power last off-season, which was obviously successful beyond anybody's wildest imagination, so let's just hope that it's not going to cause more injuries. That is the only small thing that is even rattling around in my brain as a negative, because the season he just had was nothing short or spectacular. He slashed .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers, 24 steals, and a 19.9/14.3 K%/BB% in 115 games spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He was just as dominant in the upper minors as he was at High-A with across the board domination. He hits it hard, he has a good feel to hit, he has a good approach, he has size (6'3'', 191 pounds), he has bat speed, he can lift it, and he has speed. You can be hesitant to fully buy in because it feels like he came out of nowhere, but he put up a 1.033 OPS in 45 games in the ACC in 2023, a .932 OPS in 58 games in 2022 in the Northwoods League, and then a .911 OPS in 22 games at mostly High-A in his pro debut, so it's not his fault that everyone underrated him. He always had a good feel to hit and good approach, and he always had the frame and athleticism to tack on more power, so I'm not going to hold it against him that he wasn't more hyped (4th round pick in 2023). He still didn't lift and pull the ball a ton with an under 40% Pull% and under 30% FB%, but he knew when to pick his spots (as you saw with that homer video above), and he has the type of profile that can thrive without an extreme lift and pull profile. I'm all in on Campbell. He's an elite prospect who has a chance to break camp in the bigs. 2025 Projection: 68/16/61/.252/.324/.423/19 Prime Projection: 98/26/89/.277/.356/.478/26

4) Roman Anthony - BOS, OF, 20.11 - Because the rule of prospecting is that if you are even the smallest, tiniest, tiny bit lower on a prospect than other prospectors (most have Anthony as the #1 prospect in baseball), you must bash that prospect with an overly critical lens, let me start with the negatives here. For one, Anthony isn't the best base stealer with a career 38 steals in 52 attempts (he was 21 for 28 last year), so there is risk that he doesn't run as much in the majors as we hope. Secondly, he hits the ball on the ground a lot with an around 50% GB% in 2024, which could limit his homer upside. And lastly, there is some hit tool risk with a 23.5% K%. Now that we got that out of the way, let me just say that I obviously love Anthony, he's a legit 50/50 coin flip with Campbell, and he's a no doubt elite prospect. He started the season as a 19 year old in the upper minors and obliterated both Double-A and Triple-A, slashing .291/.396/.498 with 18 homers, 21 steals, and a 23.5/14.6 K%/BB% in 119 games. He crushes the ball, he has speed, he has size, he has elite age to level production, and he hit both lefties and righties well in 2024. He's as close to a Gunnar Henderson clone as there is, and if you wanted to put him as the #1 prospect in baseball, I wouldn't argue with you. He's going to be a beast. 2025 Projection: 51/13/46/.251/.328/.422/10 Prime Projection: 92/31/98/.272/.363/.493/18

5) Matt Shaw - CHC, 3B/2B/SS, 23.4 - The little man discount never fails. Baseball scouts see a little man, and they immediately shave a few inches of projection right off the top. I don't mind it, because it consistently creates excellent buying opportunities for the right players (see the Chicago Cubs Team Report Dynasty Strategy Section below for more thoughts on this), and Matt Shaw is definitely one of those right players. He went a little later than he should have in the real MLB Draft, then he went a little later than he should have in Dynasty First Year Player Drafts, and now he's getting ranked a little later than he should be on prospect lists. He's an elite prospect that gets ranked like a merely good one. He's under 6'0'', but his bat packs a true punch, putting up an 89.3 MPH EV with a 14.6 degree launch in 35 games at Triple-A. He smoked 21 homers on the season in 121 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. He's not a pull machine, but a lot of these lift and pull machines put up some pretty low batting averages, and a profile like Shaw doesn't need to only pull the ball. He can use his hard hit ability, plus speed (31 steals), and plus contact rates (18.2% K%) to do damage when he goes oppo. He also walks a ton with a 11.9% BB%, making him a likely top of the order bat. Don't fall into the little man trap, Shaw is going to be a do everything fantasy terror when he gets his shot, and with the Isaac Paredes/Cam Smith trade, that shot could come very early into 2025. Shaw's been a target for me from before his junior year of college, and he remains a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 71/17/65/.256/.318/.419/22 Prime Projection: 96/23/83/.276/.348/.461/26

6) Carson Williams - TBR, SS, 21.2 - Williams put up a 31.8% K% in 105 games at High-A in 2023, so the worry was that the K rate would explode against upper minors pitching, but that didn't happen. It actually improved at Double-A with a 28.5% K%, and that was good enough to let his special talent shine. He jacked 20 homers with 33 steals, a 11.5% BB% and a 142 wRC+ in 115 games. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 180 pounds with an explosive righty swing that is made to launch homers. He's also an excellent athlete with plus speed and plus SS defense. Tampa's SS job is literally waiting for him, and because of his plus defense, he is sure to have all the leash he can handle even if it takes his hit tool a year or two to adjust to MLB pitching. If he can keep the K% in the high 20's, he will be a beast, and if he can continue to improve on it at only 21 years old, there is near elite dynasty asset upside. - 2025 Projection: 28/10/35/.230/.300/.424/9 Prime Projection: 89/28/96/.254/.334/.483/23

7) Leodalis De Vries - SDP, SS, 18.6 - De Vries is my pick to be the #1 overall fantasy prospect in baseball by this time next year (in a tight race with Walker Jenkins and Sebastian Walcott), that is unless he loses rookie eligibility because San Diego are madmen when it comes to promoting their elite prospects. There are already rumors they are considering calling De Vries and Salas up in 2025, which is straight wild. It did work out for Jackson Merrill, so who am I to judge? Merrill was 20 years old of course while De Vries and Salas are 18, but I love to see a team pushing the limits and setting new upper standards on how fast a prospect can fly through the minors. And De Vries has the type of talent that just might be able to pull it off. He was sent straight to full season ball for his pro debut, and while it took him a few months to find his footing, he went gangbusters once he did, slashing .275/.400/.563 with 11 homers, 8 steals, and a 20.5/14.9 K%/BB% in his final 40 games. Even with the early struggles, he still put up a 116 wRC+ in 75 games which is just silly for a 17 year old. The thing that separates De Vries from Jenkins, Walcott and De Paula for me, is that there are zero questions about him getting to his raw power. He put up a 32.4% GB%, 49.3% FB%, and 49.5% Pull%. I fully believe those other guys will get to their raw power as well, don't get me wrong, but De Vries seems to be one step ahead of them in that area. His season ended in mid August with a shoulder injury, but he played in the AFL, and while he didn't play especially well, it's still nice to see the shoulder isn't an issue. He's an elite prospect right now, and if he doesn't end up at #1, he won't be far off. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 91/31/99/.271/.353/.513/20

8) Walker Jenkins - MIN, OF, 20.1 - My Kyle Tucker comp for Jenkins last off-season turned out to be eerily accurate, at least for what they each did in their first full year of pro ball as 19 year old's. Tucker had 9 homers with 32 steals and a 16.3/10.1 K%/BB% in 117 games in the lower minors, while Jenkins had 6 homers with 17 steals and a 12.8/15.2 K%/BB% in 82 games. Like Jenkins, Tucker also wasn't a burner, and nobody really expected the steal totals to stick in the majors, but they did. And like Jenkins, the only thing that hadn't fully developed yet was the power, but Tucker had a monster power explosion the very next season, hitting 25 homers in 120 games split between High-A and Double-A. I see no reason why Jenkins can't have that same power explosion at 6'3'', 210 pounds with one of the sweetest lefty swings this game has ever seen. He doesn't hit the ball on the ground too much and he can pull it, so while his hard hit numbers weren't too impressive, they weren't too bad either, and it would be pretty shocking if he didn't develop impact power. He's on a beeline for elite dynasty asset, and he's among the favorites to be the #1 prospect in baseball by the middle of 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 103/27/96/.282/.365/.504/18

9) Andrew Painter - PHI, RHP, 22.0 - Painter underwent Tommy John surgery in late July 2023 and missed the entire 2024 regular season, but he got healthy in time for the AFL, and he's gone right back to dominating with a 2.30 ERA, 0.89 WHIP, and 18/4 K/BB in 15.2 IP over 6 outings. Just seeing that he was able to ramp up and start pitching in games without getting re-injured is a big first step that we can cross off our worry list this off-season. But he's also proving he is nearly 100% healthy with the plus to double plus fastball sitting mid to upper 90's. Like we saw with Shane Baz, it seems that breaking ball crispness and consistency can be something that lags behind after Tommy John, but long term the slider projects as plus and he also throws a lesser used curve and change that could end up plus pitches in their own right. If you ignore the injury, he's basically a perfect pitching prospect with size, athleticism, velocity, double plus fastball, plus secondary, diverse pitch mix, and plus control. And now that we've seen him back on the mound and thriving, the injury risk is a bit lessened. He moves back into my top spot among pitching prospects after his AFL performance, but it's still a tight race with Noah Schultz, who I absolutely love. It was announced the Phillies plan to slow play him in 2025, which his ETA in the majors around July, and if that helps keep him healthy, avoiding the end of season dilemma for a contending team where he's at his innings limit, I'm all for it. - 2025 Projection: 6/3.68/1.20/86 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 15/2.95/0.91/225 in 180 IP

10) Noah Schultz - CHW, LHP, 21.8 - Baby Johnson is the #1B pitching prospect in baseball, and while there are other really good contenders (Jobe, Bubba, Kumar), Schultz holds this spot for being absolutely unprecedented. Even the Baby Johnson nickname might not fit, as Randy Johnson had an insane 318 walks in 400.1 minor league IP before getting the call to the bigs. Schultz is 6'9'', 220 pounds with an almost sidearm lefty delivery that he uses to fire a mid to upper 90's fastball and double plus slider (he also mixes in a cutter and a change). He sliced through the minors with absolutely no problem, putting up a 2.24 ERA with a 32.1/6.7% K%/BB% in 88.1 IP at mostly Double-A. Having that level of control as a 20/21 year old at that size with that kind of stuff is really mind blowing. He's not a finished product as he's yet to eclipse 4 IP in any outing of his career and he needs to continue to work on a good third/fourth pitch, but the combination of floor/upside is simply off the charts. Other than Roki Sasaki (who really shouldn't be considered a prospect), and Painter now that he's healthy, there is no other pitching prospect I would take over Schultz. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.71/1.24/82 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.05/1.01/230 in 180 IP

11) Jordan Lawlar - ARI, SS, 22.9 - Lawlar had a completely lost season in 2024 due to a broken thumb and hamstring injury, playing in just 23 games. He's no stranger to injuries as he also underwent major shoulder surgery in 2021. Out of sight, out of mind never loses in the prospecting industry, but Lawlar is the type of talent where you should fight that urge. He already had a huge year in the upper minors in 2023, and he's only 22, so I don't think lost development time should be a major consideration here. Even in the 23 games he played this year he put up .900 OPS, and he then got sent to the grown man Dominican Winter League and isn't embarrassing himself with a .670 OPS. Only Hector Rodriguez of the Reds has a higher OPS of players around Lawlar's age (he's outdoing Noelvi Marte, Deyvison De Los Santos, and Liover Peguero). Just the fact he's playing and getting reps in a league where everyone doesn't put up silly numbers like the AFL is another reason to not get too hung up on the lost season. He has the potential for a special power/speed combo (20 homers and 36 steals in 105 games in 2023), and while there is some hit tool risk, it's not really in that extreme zone with around mid 20 strikeout rates throughout his career. He's not a finished product, and I would expect him to start the year in the minors, but Lawlar will be up eventually in 2025, and he can make a big impact immediately. Don't ding him too much for the injuries. 2025 Projection: 55/14/57/.241/.312/.417/21 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.266/.339/.459/38

12) Samuel Basallo - BAL, C/1B, 20.7 - Basallo didn't quite obliterate the upper minors like he did the lower minors, slashing .278/.341/.449 with 19 homers, 10 steals, and a 21.1/8.6 K%/BB% in 127 games, but when you take into account that he was 19 years old for the vast majority of the season, it gets a lot more impressive. He was also much better at Double-A with a 134 wRC+ in 106 games than he was at Triple-A (62 wRC+ with a 31.4% K% in 21 games), so I think we can give him a pass for an adjustment period with a new team, coaches, teammates, league, home park etc ... Even at Triple-A, the sweet lefty swinging, 6'4'' Basallo put up a 91.1 MPH EV. He's always put up solid contact rates in the minors, but the spike at Triple-A could also be an indicator that we shouldn't expect the highest BA at least early in his career. He puts the ball on the ground a decent amount, but with his type of double plus power, he's launch proof. I don't know where he fits in defensively with Adley behind the plate, and plenty of competition at 1B (Mayo and Mountcastle), but long term there seems to be plenty of room for all of them. He's a special power bat. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/35/.241/.300/.430/2 Prime Projection: 84/30/97/.268/.337/.505/6

13) Emmanuel Rodriguez - MIN, OF, 22.1 - You can't talk about Rodriguez without talking about the fact that the guy is rarely on the field. He played in only 47 games this year due to a nagging thumb injury, and he played in only 47 games in 2022 due to a meniscus tear (knee). He did get in a mostly full season in 2023 though (he missed a few weeks with an abdominal strain), and he got in a full rookie ball season in 2021, so I'm hesitant to officially slap the injury prone label on him. It's something to take into account to break a tie, but his upside is way too high to meaningfully move him down the rankings because of it. He's a power/speed/OBP beast with 9 homers, 9 steals, and a .459 OBP at mostly Double-A in 47 games. It was good for a 203 wRC+ at the level. He crushes the ball, he lifts it, and he's an excellent athlete who plays CF. Injuries aren't the only concern though, he also has strikeout problems with a 29.7% K%. Some of it is because of how patient he is, but definitely not all of it. I wouldn't say Minnesota's OF is wide open, but Minnesota already announced how they want to limit Buxton to like 100-110 games next year, and while they have solid options for their corner spots, they are far from locked down. If Rodriguez is healthy and producing at Triple-A, it might not be long before he gets the call to the majors, and there is potential for monster fantasy impact, especially in an OBP league. - 2025 Projection: 36/10/31/.224/.310/435/8 Prime Projection: 92/29/89/.248/.342/.490/24

14) Sebastian Walcott - TEX, SS, 19.1 - The 6'4'', uber athletic Walcott is the type of special talent where you can watch a few swings of his on Youtube as a 16 year old and immediately fall in love with him, which is exactly what happened when he was my #1 target from his international class. He's then been that rocket ship prospect you hope for, culminating with him putting up a 172 wRC+ at Double-A as an 18 year old ... granted it came in 5 games with a 29.2/4.2 K%/BB%, but I felt it would be more dramatic to leave that part out. And what he did at Double-A was more or less meaningless when he was already over 4 years younger than the average player at High-A, where he slashed .261/.342/.443 with 10 homers, 26 steals, and a 25.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 116 games. It was good for a 123 wRC+. It can be harder to evaluate players when they are so much younger than the level, but there was actually a similarly talented 18 year old at High-A all season with Walcott, Ethan Salas, and Salas put up a 75 wRC+ for comparison. The elite dynasty asset potential is clear with a potentially plus to double plus power/speed combo, but he's not quite there yet. The hit tool is still a risk and the K rates have been high at every stop. He also hasn't fully tapped into his raw power yet with relatively low flyball rates (although he pulls the ball over 50%). I wouldn't quite place him in the truly elite prospect tier, but he's in the one right under that. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 87/28/94/.263/.339/.484/24

15) Travis Bazzana - CLE, 2B, 22.7 - Selected 1st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bazzana looks like a tightly wound ball of kinetic energy that is just ready to explode in the box (I think ball of "Potential" energy is actually the correct scientific term, but I felt like "Kinetic" just hit harder :) ... There is toe tapping and bat wiggling before he absolutely uncoils on the baseball, jacking 28 homers in 60 games in the Pac 12 this year, and also smoking 6 homers with a 1.037 OPS in the wood bat cape cod league in 2023. He's "only" 6 feet tall, but there is easy plus power in here at the least. He combines the plus power with a near elite plate approach/hit tool (12.5%/25.7% K%/BB%), and speed (16 steals). He didn't standout in his pro debut, but he did enough to feel confident about him fulfilling his upside with 3 homers, 5 steals, a 126 wRC+ and 25.4/13.9 K%/BB% in 27 games at High-A. He's the total offensive package, and there is a reason he got taken #1 overall by a very smart franchise despite limited defensive value. The only thing that can stop him seems to be his parents. His parents almost ended his career before it started when celebrating. His dad tried to rip his arm out of his socket, and then his mom put him in some kind of neck hold into a tripping maneuver. Travis almost looked like he was about to square up with his mom for a second there. I guess they do things differently Down Under in Australia. He ranked 2nd overall on the Top 146 2025 First Year Player Draft Rankings (this link is to the free Top 12 here on the Brick Wall). - 2025 Projection: 31/7/31/.247/.319/.420/8 Prime Projection: 91/24/79/.271/.349/.455/25

16) JJ Wetherholt – STL, 2B, 22.7 – Selected 7th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Wetherholt might not have quite the ceiling of Bazzana, but even that is highly debatable, and he’s establishing that he most probably has the floor edge with a 11.9% K% at Single-A vs. Bazzana’s 25.4% K% at High-A. Different levels, but that is a pretty stark difference. He hit the ball on the ground a lot more than Bazzana, which is where some of that upside edge comes in, but he did it with a 91.9 MPH EV, so don’t cap his power upside too much. He’s two inches smaller than Bazzana at 5’10”, but he rocks that little man leg kick that I’ve always loved, and always seems to get the most out of smaller guys raw power. He slid in the draft a bit after getting a lot of #1 overall buzz, likely due to missing about half of the season with a hamstring injury and still not being fully healthy when he returned. It was his 2nd major hamstring injury within the year. His 16 homer pace was also not that impressive when everyone else was hitting like 30+. What he does better than maybe anyone else in the draft though is hit. He put up a 10.4%/18.3% K%/BB% in 2024 and had a 8.2% K% in 2023. He’s a complete hitter who uses the entire field with a quick and simple lefty swing. Tack on plus speed (57 steals in 145 career games), and you have a damn enticing fantasy player even if his power upside doesn’t quite match some of the other bats in the class. I have Bazzana ranked over him, but I don’t think it’s some no brainer decision. JJ is right there. – 2025 Projection: 18/3/16/.259/.321/.401/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/73/.287/.353/.438/23

17) Josue De Paula - LAD, OF, 19.10 - De Paula doesn't truly get the hype that Walker Jenkins, Sebastian Walcott and Leo De Vries gets, but he deserves every little bit of it. He might have the best hit/approach/power combo of all of them, putting up a 19.8/17.5 K%/BB% with a 130 wRC+ in 107 games split between Single-A and High-A. His game power still hasn't exploded, but it ticked up from 2023 with 10 homers (2 homers in 2023), and he hits the ball so hard at 6'3'' that there is little doubt about his power potential. He doesn't sell out for power, and his groundball and pull rates are fine, so he has the potential to be one of those special monster triple-slash middle of the order mashers. He's not a burner, but he went 27 for 30 on the bases, so the guy is obviously a good athlete who knows how to steal a base. He's not a good defensive player, but with his potentially elite bat, I'm not scared off by that. He won't get ranked as highly on real life lists as those aforementioned teenagers, but don't let that deter you from thinking that Josue isn't on that level. I was touting Josue back when he was barely heard of, and I'll keep being high on him even as his hype gains steam. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/26/94/.276/.364/.482/14

18) Max Clark - DET, OF, 20.3 - Clark was the 3rd overall pick in a stacked 2023 draft class, and he played exactly as advertised in his first full season of pro ball, slashing .279/.372/.421 with 9 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.2/12.4 K%/BB% in 107 games split between Single-A (134 wRC+) and High-A (119 wRC+). He's an absolutely electric player when you watch him with a vicious lefty swing and plus speed. He's already one of the more exciting top of the order prospects in the lower minors, and when gains more power naturally, and starts lifting the ball a bit more (48% GB%), he can explode into a truly elite prospect. His hype has actually been relatively subdued considering how much pre draft hype he got, but make no mistake, Clark can be special. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 96/20/69/.277/.351/.443/30

19) Bubba Chandler - PIT, RHP, 22.7 - Just like with hitting prospects where there seems to be two camps between preferring the hit tool first, power later profile vs. power first, hit tool later, there is a similar split with pitching prospects which is pure stuff vs. refinement/command. Chandler most certainly fell into the pure stuff first category with his upside being obvious, but he had a lot of refinement needed with a 4.75 ERA and 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% 106 IP at High-A in 2023. And that refinement smacked upper minors hitters right in the face in 2024 with him exploding. He put up a 3.08 ERA with a 30.9/8.6 K%/BB% in 119.2 IP. He was even better at Triple-A than he was at Double-A. The fastball sits 96.8 MPH and notched a 30.5% whiff% at Triple-A. The changeup is his best secondary with a 83.6 MPH EV against and 41.2% whiff%. The slider is above average with a 85 MPH EV against and 29.4% whiff%. And the lesser used curve was a good pitch too. He also most certainly looks the part at a built up and athletic 6'2''. There is zero doubt that this is an elite pitching prospect with ace upside. He's not a completely finished product and he needs to continue to improve his command and refine his pitches, but he's shown he's more than capable of making those improvements in 2024. He could crack the Pirates rotation out of camp, and even if he doesn't, it won't be long before he gets the call. I know everyone likes Jobe more, and I obviously love Jobe too, but I prefer Chandler by a hair - 2025 Projection: 7/3.87/1.25/137 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.34/1.13/220 in 185 IP

20) Jackson Jobe - DET, RHP, 22.8 - I love Jobe. He's definitely an elite pitching prospect. But there are a few other truly elite pitching prospects in the minors right now (Painter, Schultz, Bubba, Kumar), and Jobe's 25.6/12.0 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP at mostly Double-A just isn't as impressive as theirs. It came with a 2.34 ERA, and the stuff is filthy with a 97 MPH plus fastball and 3 potentially plus secondaries in his sweeper, changeup, and cutter, so he's right there with all of them, he just doesn't hold down the top spot right now. Or the top 2. I have him 4th behind Painter, Schultz and Bubba, but there is no shame in that game as those guys are potentially true aces, just like Jobe is. Jobe should break camp with the team in 2025, and while I wouldn't expect an ace season right out of the gate, I'm betting on him getting there eventually. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.83/1.27/136 in 140 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.08/207 in 180 IP

21) Kumar Rocker - TEX, RHP, 25.4 - It's been a super bumpy ride, to say the least, but Rocker has inexplicably blasted off into elite pitching prospect status after just 48.1 IP this season. Well, it's not exactly inexplicable, it's explicable because he always had the nasty stuff to get here if he stayed healthy. Can we say pitching 48.1 IP is "staying" healthy? I don't know. But what I do know is that the high octane stuff is elite enough to take on that risk. The 4-seamer sits mid to upper 90's, and while it's not a huge bat missing weapon without tons of vertical break, he also throws a mid to upper 90's sinker which pounds the ball into the dirt. He can start throwing the sinker more, and he can also work on the movement profile of the 4-seamer now that he's healthy. The real money maker is the truly elite slider. It put up a 50% whiff% in 11.2 IP in the majors and a 71.4% whiff% in 10 IP at Triple-A. He rounds out the arsenal with a lesser used changeup, and how good he can get that pitch could be a big factor in just how high the upside will end up. Digging into the nitty gritty of his pitch mix is almost besides the point though, because staying healthy is essentially the only thing he needs to do. The Mets drafted him 10th overall and didn't sign him because they didn't like his medicals. He then underwent shoulder surgery shortly after that, but looked so good in Independent ball when he returned from the surgery, that the Rangers selected him 3rd overall the next year. Which he followed up with Tommy John in 2023, returning for the 2nd half of 2024, where he put up a 1.96 ERA with a 39.6/3.6 K%/BB% in 36.2 IP at mostly AA and AAA. It's about as risky of a health profile as it gets, but all pitchers are so risky, that I don't want to discount him too much because of it. I'll take on extra risk when the upside is a true ace. The downside could be a high leverage reliever though if he keeps getting hurt. 2025 Projection: 9/3.71/1.20/146 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.35/1.13/190 in 160 IP

22) Chase Burns – CIN, RHP, 22.3 – Selected 2nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, dynasty managers owe a huge debt of gratitude to Cincinnati for going Burns over Condon. It would have made me legitimately sad to see Burns going to the Rockies. I know Cincinnati is no cake walk for pitchers themselves, but they just have a small ballpark, they don’t have different air. And we’ve seen plenty of pitchers have excellent seasons in Cincy (Castillo, Gray, Greene, Lodolo), so I wouldn’t let this landing spot move you off Burns at all. He has legit ace upside at a strong 6’3”, 210 pounds with a double plus fastball that sits in the upper 90’s and a double plus slider that put up elite whiff rates. It led to a 2.70 ERA with a ridiculous 48.8%/7.7% K%/BB% in 100 IP in the ACC. He’s inevitably going to get compared to Skenes, and Skenes put up a 1.69 ERA with a 45.2%/4.3% K%/BB% in 122.2 IP in the SEC. Skenes was in the tougher conference (although Burns pitched well in the SEC in 2022-23 before transferring to the ACC) with a better ERA, better walk rate and more IP. Burns isn’t as good as Skenes, but not many pitchers are better than Skenes, so that isn’t much of a knock. Burns also throws a curve and changeup to give him a legit starters pitch mix, and how well he can develop those pitches could dictate whether he becomes a true ace or a high K, #2/3 type. If your dynasty team is stacked with hitting, I don’t think taking Burns #1 overall in a FYPD should be ruled out. The teams that took Skenes over Langford and Crews in 2024 aren’t complaining too much right now, and while I already noted that Burns isn’t Skenes, the college hitting class also aren’t Langford/Crews. – 2025 Projection: 4/3.73/1.20/87 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.23/1.08/237 in 190 IP

23) Chase DeLauter - CLE, OF, 23.6 - I don't know if DeLauter needs to stop missing leg day at the gym, or by looking at the size of those trunks, maybe he needs to skip more leg days, but he has to figure out a way to keep the gams healthy. He broke his foot pre draft in 2022 which required surgery, and then he broke that same foot this year while running the bases. This one didn't require surgery and wasn't as serious, but at 6'3'', 235 pounds, those feet are going to continue to take a beating. He was able to return from the 2nd broken foot only to have a hamstring strain end his regular season about one month later. He dominated the AFL after the season, so that also wasn't serious, but the injuries are starting to get concerning. They seemed to have stopped him from running at all this year with only 1 steal in 45 total games (although he stole 2 in 12 games in the AFL). The injuries haven't stopped him from raking though. The hit tool and plate approach look truly elite with a 13.4/11.6 K%/BB%, and he has big power with 7 homers in 36 upper minors games. One of those homers was an inside the park job, which showed off his athleticism. He's a special talent with above average to plus across the board skills, but he has to stay healthy, and staying healthy looks like it might entail not stealing a ton of bases, which does hurt the fantasy value a bit. - 2025 Projection: 66/19/72/.256/.320/.439/7 Prime Projection: 90/26/84/.278/.351/.472/11

24) Bryce Eldridge - SFG, 1B, 20.5 - Let me just pump the brakes on Eldridge a little bit ... hold up ... don't kill me quite yet. I love Eldridge. He is so clearly a beastly power bat at 6'7'', 223 pounds with 23 homers in 116 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. But let me just bring up a few reasons why maybe not quite enough risk is being factored into his current humongous fantasy hype. For one, his hit tool is a legitimate risk with a 25.3% K%, and it was high in the AFL too with a 34.8% K% in 10 games. Sure he made it to the upper minors as a 19 year old, and while he didn't embarrass himself or anything, he didn't dominate either with only 1 homer in 17 games. His FB rates and launch are fine, but he's not exactly a launch machine. And lastly, San Francisco is death on lefty homers. Eldridge has the power to overcome that, so I'm not going too crazy there, but combined with the swing and miss and moderate launch, that is a trifecta of negatives which tells me to maybe have just a small amount of restraint here. Again, I love Eldridge. He's a special power bat. I just give this negatively tinted blurb relative to the monster hype he's already getting, and maybe something to at least keep in mind when you are dealing in trade talks involving him this off-season from either direction. - 2025 Projection: 29/10/36/.227/.301/.423/2 Prime Projection: 88/32/97/.258/.342/.495/6

25) Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - If you think Holliday had a bad MLB debut, get a load of this guy. Mayo was utterly lost at the dish with a .294 OPS and 47.8/8.7 K%/BB% in 46 PA. He had zero barrels with an 84.7 MPH EV and a 45.6% whiff%. It's a small sample, but I've seen a lot of poor debuts, and this one is up there with some of the worst, especially for a hyped up prospect. The debut was especially bad, but we've seen plenty of eventual studs have a terrible MLB debut. Just to use one example, Aaron Judge had a .179 BA with a 42.5% whiff% in his 95 PA debut (although it came with 4 homers and a .608 OPS), and he's been just fine. I don't want to put too much weight on the scary debut when Mayo has so many other things going him. His power is unquestionable at 6'5'', 230 pounds with 22 homers and a 90.7 MPH EV in 89 games at Triple-A. He swings a lightning quick bat with a double plus 74.1 MPH swing, and it's a relatively short swing too with a 7 foot length. His strikeout rates were also so much better in the minors with a 24.9% K% this year. He was getting sporadic playing time in the majors and doing a lot of pinch hitting, which is another reason to mostly ignore the MLB numbers. Is it in the back of my mind? Yea, I'm human. But I'm still treating him like an elite power hitting prospect. He currently doesn't have a starting job, so he's going to need injuries/ineffectiveness to open one up for him, or he's going to have to truly kick the door down. - 2025 Projection: 39/14/49/.225/.302/.435/3 Prime Projection: 84/33/98/.249/.336/.512/6

26) Marcelo Mayer - BOS, SS, 22.3 - Mayer was the 4th overall pick in the draft and just put up a 142 wRC+ in his age 21 year old season at Double-A, and the hype still feels so subdued on him. He might have to get used to that, because it seems like he's setting up for a Bryan Reynolds-like fantasy career. Really good, but not good enough for anyone to seemingly care to really gush over him. That 142 wRC+ came with only 8 homers and 13 steals in 77 games. He did it on the back of the hit tool with a .307 BA and 19.7/9.0 K%/BB%, but the .367 BABIP did some of that heavy lifting, and his strikeout rates have been on the high side throughout his career, so you can't really bank on a truly elite hit tool long term. His sweet lefty swing at 6'3'' is what got him drafted so highly, and that swing is still special with power and quickness, but it's geared more for all around hitting than pure homer power with a 47.4% GB% and 26.5% FB%. He's a good baserunner, but he's not a burner, so you can't count on huge steal totals either. Reynolds is really the perfect comp with his 162 game career averages of a .276 BA, .352 OBP, 25 homers and 8 steals. Maybe playing with Boston instead of Pittsburgh will garner him more hype in the long run, but fantasy wise, that equals a really good fantasy player who never quite reaches great levels. 2025 Projection: 28/8/33/.256/.318/.415/6 Prime Projection: 91/25/93/.276/.352/.470/11

27) Colt Emerson - SEA, SS, 19.8 - There is a case to be made that Emerson is overrated. He has high groundball rates and he doesn't pull the ball all that much, leading to only 4 homers in 70 games split between Single-A and High-A. It's also not a Jackson Merrill situation where the guy smashes the ball. Emerson can hit it hard, but he's not putting up gaudy EV's. He's also not a burner with average speed. So it's a hit tool first profile, and like many hit tool first profiles, the hit tool can start to take steps back against more advanced pitching, which is what happened this year. He put up a .263 BA on the season, and the 21.6/10.8 K%/BB% in 29 games at High-A isn't super impressive. A scenario where he ends up with a good, but not great hit tool, to go along with a moderate power/speed combo, definitely seems to be one possible outcome here. I'm only painting with a negative brush to start because I think it's more interesting. We know what a positive outcome can look like, which is that both the raw and game power ticks up over time, the plate skills remain plus to double plus, and the base stealing ability is legit (15 steals in 17 attempts). And keep in mind he was only 18 years old for most of the season. This is a high floor/high ceiling prospect in the mold of your Wander Franco's. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection:  99/22/72/.284/.362/.455/22

28) Christian Moore - LAA, 2B, 21.10 - Selected 8th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the Angels don't fuck around when it comes to promoting advanced college hitters to the majors, so you know Moore is going to be a contributor on your fantasy team real quick, possibly as soon as Opening Day. Shit, he almost made his MLB debut in 2024 with his absolute destruction of pro ball, slashing .322/.378/.533 with 5 homers, 2 steals, and a 29.6/8.2 K%/BB% in 23 games at Double-A. A knee injury (meniscus) is likely the only thing that stopped that from happening, but he returned to Double-A before the season ended and went 3 for 4 with a double and 4 RBI, so I wouldn't be worried about the knee. I fell in love with his personality during his Draft Day interview. It was the perfect mix of confident, cocky, thoughtful, playful and mature. That just seems like the type of infectious attitude I want on my team. He wasn't kidding when he said he had Champion in his blood. And of course, he was an absolute beast in the SEC, smashing 34 homers with a 1.248 OPS and 14.5%/11.3% K%/BB% in 72 games. He has a very strong righty swing at 6'1'', 210 pounds, producing at least plus power with average speed on the bases. In his freshman year in 2022, he put up a 1.062 OPS with 10 homers in 149 PA to give you an idea of the type of natural talent this is. As you saw with his K rate at Double-A, there are definitely some hit tool issues, which I'm not ignoring, but I'm also not letting it scare me off. I was high on Moore before his pro debut, and now I am over the moon for him. - 2025 Projection: 70/23/77/.242/.310/.437/8 Prime Projection: 85/28/94/.260/.335/.481/10

29) Justin Crawford - PHI, OF, 21.3 - Crawford is just raw talenting his way through the minor leagues with elite bloodlines and elite talent an uber athletic 6'2'', 188 pounds. He slashed .313/.360/.444 with 9 homers, 42 steals, and an 18.7/6.4 K%/BB% in 110 games split between High-A and Double-A. He was even better at Double-A than he was at High-A with a 140 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed, he hits the ball hard, and he has a good feel to hit. It's pure talent baby, but if he doesn't start to refine his game, it will eventually catch up to him. He has an extreme 61% GB% and he chases a ton. Good defense and good pitchers, which he will find in the majors, are better able to take advantage of that than minor leaguers. But if he can start to refine his game, and at only 21 years old, I don't see why he wouldn't, watch the hell out. The upside is a legit elite dynasty asset, and while I wouldn't bet on him reaching that lofty ceiling, he can be a game changing fantasy player with even a moderately good outcome. I think there is too much focus on his deficiencies, and not enough focus on what he does well. I love him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 86/17/64/.273/.322/.420/39

30) Jaison Chourio - CLE, OF, 19.10 - Chourio gets plenty of love, but I'm not sure it's nearly enough. A lot of his love gets couched in "but he's not as good as his brother," which isn't quite fair, because I think there is near elite prospect upside in here, and he took steps towards that in 2024. His power didn't explode (yet), but it did tick up with 5 homers in 98 games at Single-A (1 homer was his previous career high). He's a still projectable 6'1'' with an explosive swing, so as he gains more raw power, and as he raises his launch (49.3% GB%), there could be a real power breakout coming down the line. And he has the elite plate skills (16.0/`19.9 K%/BB%) and speed (44 steals) to do the rest. He's yet to put up less than a 140 wRC+ at any stop of his career. This is easily a Top 30 fantasy prospect for me, and even that could be underselling him. If he gets lukewarm love in off-season prospect drafts where he's available, you need to jump all over that. Now is the time to target him aggressively. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 98/18/68/.276/.355/.433/34

31) Aidan Miller - PHI, SS, 20.10 - Miller wasn't a target for me in last year's FYPD class based on his perceived value/hype, but he proved the hype was warranted in his pro debut, obliterating Single-A with a 153 wRC+, and hitting well at the more age appropriate High-A, slashing .258/.353/.444 with 6 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.1/11.6 K%/BB% in 58 games. His big, quick and powerful righty swing was what everyone fell in love with originally, and he proved he can combine that with a good feel to hit, a good approach, and good athleticism. He can also play a decent SS, so his glove is likely to stick somewhere on the infield and potentially end up an asset as well. He's not exactly standout in any one area at the moment, but there is power upside in the bat which gives him the ceiling of a do everything, middle of the order masher. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.269/.342/.468/15

32) Jesus Made - MIL, SS, 17.11 - I love to see deep international prospects who cracked my Top 1,000 Rankings have big breakouts, and I thought my blurb for him last off-season was pretty interesting considering how things played out: "Stop me if you heard this one before, but the switch hitting Made is a projectable and toolsy 6’1”, 165 pounds with a swing geared towards launching the ball. He has a mature plate approach and he has the potential to be a very good defensive SS. I know these international prospect blurbs can get repetitive especially as we get deep into the class, but these are the prospects that can blow up if you want upside. Embrace the mystery. Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.258/.334/.449/12." And blow up Made did as one of the top breakouts in the DSL, slashing .331/.458/.554 with 6 homers, 28 steals, and a 13.0%/18.1% K%/BB% in 51 games. He's projectable, he's toolsy, he hits the ball hard, the plate approach is very strong, and he's a good SS. That is the total package, and while there is still a lot of risk as DSL performance is the least trustworthy, there is also truly elite prospect upside. I know there are many leagues, usually shallower ones, where gunning for the top pure upside is the best strategy to take, but even in medium to deeper leagues, Made is worth the risk. And use Made as a reminder to not be afraid to dive into the mystery that is the international class as you get deeper into first year player drafts this off-season. That is why the last third of my Top 146 FYPD Rankings are always jam packed with these guys. Low upside, boring college guys just aren't likely to be difference makers. Go for the lotto ticket. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.276/.352/.472/26

33) Nick Kurtz - OAK, 1B, 22.1 - Selected 4th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Kurtz had one of the best pro debuts in his draft class with 4 homers in 7 games at Single-A, and a 129 wRC+ with a 20.0/13.3 K%/BB% in 5 games at Double-A. It was a just a continuation of the 3 years of dominance in the ACC. He's a large man at 6'5'', 240 pounds in the mold of a Jim Thome, country strong type. But he's not just brute strength, he has electric bat speed that led to 61 homers in 164 career games in college. He combines the at least plus power with an extremely patient plate approach and good feel to hit (16.2%/30% K%/BB%). He also has some sneaky athleticism, evidenced by a perfect 11 for 11 on the bases in his college career. The ceiling here is your classic complete hitting first baseman with power and patience. And it looks like the Athletics intend to fly him through the minors, so it might not even be crazy to see him break camp with the team, even if I wouldn't bet on that. The biggest downside is that his season ended on August 24th with a hamstring injury, and injuries have plagued him throughout his career, so I think it's something that has to be taken into account unfortunately. He returned in time to decimate the AFL with a 1.058 OPS in 13 games, so I don’t think you should overrate the injury risk too much, but it’s worth noting. - 2025 Projection: 48/16/57/.247/.323/.439/4 Prime Projection: 87/28/93/.269/.357/.490/7

34) Felnin Celesten - SEA, SS, 19.7 - Celesten finally made his long awaited pro debut in 2024, and he didn't disappoint, slashing .352/.431/.568 with 3 homers, 5 steals, and a 19.4/12.5 K%/BB% in 32 games at stateside rookie ball. All of the explosive traits that made him such a hyped international prospect were fully present with an extremely athletic and powerful swing (particularly from the left side, but he dominated in 2024 with both swings) that already looks like an MLB swing. He's an explosive athlete in general with plus speed, so seeing the excellent plate skills from the jump in pro ball is a big deal. He does have two blemishes on his profile preventing him from ranking even higher than this though. It's the 2nd year in a row that an injury kept him out. A hamstring injury in 2023 wiped out his entire season, and a hamate injury that required surgery ended his season on July 23rd this year. The 2nd blemish is a 64.9% GB%, which is very extreme. Personally, I'm blinded by his extreme upside, and I'm apt to overlook the negatives. When a prospect has that type of upside, it almost never makes sense to trade them at this stage of their career. His value is pretty high right now, but I think he falls into the buy high range for me. Certainly don't trade him, and see if you can get him included in a trade without seeming like you're frothing at the mouth for him too much, because it could give his owner second thoughts if you come on too strong. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.273/.344/.472/25

35) Konnor Griffin - PIT, OF, 18.11 - Selected 9th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Griffin has the highest pure upside in this entire draft. He's 6'4'', 215 pounds and has the look of a #1 overall pick in the NFL Draft as a QB. He has the neck of a football player too. He also has the athleticism of a football player with legit potential to put up 30/30 seasons with a plus to double plus power/speed combo. He's shown a good feel to hit with a good plate approach in his high school career, but like I mentioned back in February 2024 when I did a very early Top 10 FYPD Ranking, the swing isn't necessarily the smoothest thing in the world, although it actually looks much better to me now than it did then. Plus you can tack on electric bat speed and bank on continued refinement considering how young he is for the class. Pitt obviously wasn't worried enough about the hit tool to let him slip by them at #9, and for fantasy especially, I wouldn't let it scare you off him either. This is legit elite dynasty asset potential. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 89/25/92/.261/.337/.470/33

36) Tink Hence - STL, RHP, 22.8 - Tink is the forgotten about elite pitching prospect. He has injury/durability issues, but almost every pitching prospect has injury/durability risk, and I feel like it's really easy to start picking and choosing whose injury/durability issues you hand wave away, and whose you hyper focus on. Everyone has seemed to hyper focus on Hence's issues, where a guy like Painter can literally undergo Tommy John surgery and everyone is completely good with it, nothing to see here. Jobe, Schultz, and Rocker have all dealt with injuries and haven't racked up innings. But for Tink, his problems are like the main focus of his evaluation, and the main focus should be on his nasty stuff. Here is a twitter compilation video of Hence making hitters look absolutely silly with his changeup, both lefty and righty hitters. And that isn't even arguably his best secondary with a gyro slider and curve that he seems to have on a string, racking up strikeouts. He combines the 3 nasty secondaries with a mid 90's fastball that he can blow by hitters up in the zone with a good movement profile. It all led to a 2.71 ERA with a 34.1/8.1 K%/BB% in 79.2 IP. There is definitely injury as he's battled a variety of injuries in his professional career (shoulder, chest and lat issues with year), and he's not a particularly huge/broad guy, but they talk about him like he's 5 foot nothing, 150 pounds. The guy is 6'1'', 195 pounds. He's not that small. All pitchers have injury risk to me, so I'm not one to hyper focus on the injury risk. You know what you are getting into when you draft a pitching prospect, no matter how big and broad they are, they can all go down. I'm focused on Hence's true top of the rotation upside, and I feel like there is a bit of a buying opportunity right now. 2025 Projection: 4/3.89/1.30/78 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/186 in 168 IP

37) Emil Morales - LAD, SS, 18.6 - Morales was my 3rd ranked international prospect (behind only Leo and Paulino) and one of my top FYPD targets, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "His physicality in the box stands out immediately. He is a grown man at 6’3”, 180 pounds with a big righty swing that can punish a baseball. He combines that with a mature plate approach and a good feel to hit. It certainly looks like he can be a middle of the order beast, and he has the right team to get it out of him. He’s a definite target." ... and he more than came through as one of, if not the top DSL breakout, slashing .342/.478/.691 with 14 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.4/19.9 K%/BB% in 46 games. He's a lift and pull machine and there is potential for double plus raw power at peak, meaning the home run upside here is elite. The swing is quick and athletic, and he's a good athlete for his size too. Most places have Jesus Made over Emil Morales an easy call in Made's favor, but I actually think it's pretty damn close. Made has the hit tool and speed edge, but Morales has the game power and raw power edge, and often times that power edge can overcome all other flaws. A 22.4% K% is on the high side for the DSL, so I do agree that Made's combo of floor and upside takes it, but I'm not 100% sure I'm making the right call there. Either way, I love both, and I really, really love Morales compared to his much cheaper price. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 86/33/98/.250/.338/.519/9

38) Quinn Mathews - STL, LHP, 24.6 - I think it's easy to completely hand wave Mathews getting bombed at Triple-A to close out the season (6.48 ERA with a 27.8/17.7 K%/BB% in 16.2 IP), but I do think there might be at least a small amount of signal there that we shouldn't just 100% dismiss. I'm not going to put too much emphasis on it either seeing as he was already at a career high in IP, and you have to give humans a chance to adjust to a new level, new team, new coaches etc ..., but there is one wrinkle that makes me pause, and that wrinkle is that Triple-A is the only level to use the MLB ball. Every other level uses their own balls, and I mean, the ball is a pretty important factor. Blade Tidwell obliterated Double-A, got called up to Triple-A earlier in the season, and then stunk at Triple-A for a large sample. Everyone hates Blade Tidwell now. Mathews (and Brandon Sproat has a similar story too), didn't have a large sample at Triple-A, so it's easy to just hand wave it away, but I do think it's something to keep in mind. Now just because I'm keeping it in mind, doesn't mean I still don't love Mathews. He's a 6'5'', lefty with a mid 90's fastball and two whiff machine secondaries in his slider and changeup (he also throws a curve and sinker). He dominated all season (other than at Triple-A) with a 2.76 ERA and 35.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 143.1 IP. And as you can see, he stays healthy, which does matter. I lean towards him being more of a #2 starter than a true ace, but add a star for his health, and he's knocking on the door of the bigs. I like him a ton. Maybe I just feel the need to knock him down a peg because of my love for Tink, who I have ranked higher than Mathews, while most have it the other way around. The truth is, I love both of them (just Tink more ;). 2025 Projection: 6/3.98/1.32/97 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.59/1.20/190 in 180 IP

39) Dalton Rushing - LAD, C/OF, 24.1 - It seems that LA is set on keeping Rushing at catcher, which I completely understand for real life value, but for fantasy, I don't think it's great. Will Smith is signed until 2034, meaning Rushing looks ticketed for some kind of hybrid C/1B/OF/DH role, and with how hard it is to crack the Dodgers full time lineup (and with how little leash they give their prospects due to unlimited resources and strong organizational depth), it seems like Rushing is going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. They are not rolling out the red carpet for him at all, and I do think it hurts his fantasy value a bit. Putting defense aside for now, as a pure hitter, there is so much to like. He proved himself in the upper minors in 2024, slashing .271/.385/.512 with 26 homers, 2 steals, and a 20.5/12.7 K%/BB% in 114 games split between Double-A (149 wRC+) and Triple-A (128 wRC+). He has easy plus power with a 90.8 MPH EV, he has a launch made for both power and average, and he has a plus plate approach. The hit tool is solid, but I can see that dipping to below average against major league pitching, and like I mentioned earlier, we have seen LA be very quick with the hook if young players aren't producing. I like the bat a ton, but defense, path to playing time, and the slight hit tool questions are enough to make me hesitant to really value him at a premium right now. - 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.242/.310/.428/1 Prime Projection: 78/24/83/.262/.339/.465/2

40) Cam Smith - HOU, 3B, 22.1 - Selected 14th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'3'', 224 pound Smith generates a tremendous amount of power with very little movement in his swing. It is quick, powerful and short to the ball. It is straight up one of the quietest swings from one of the biggest men I've ever seen. The swing is geared more for a line drive, all fields approach rather than pull and lift, which is why he didn't put up the gaudy homer totals as some of his other college hitting brethren with only 16 homers in 66 games in the ACC. But he has the raw power to make that profile work, and the upside is that it can come with a high BA. We saw what this profile can look like at it's best in his dominant pro debut, slashing .313/.396/.609 with 7 homers, 2 steals, and a 17.9/11.2 K%/BB% in 32 games split between Single-A, High-A, and Double-A. He put up a 122 wRC+ in 5 games at Double-A, so the profile was transferring to the upper minors, and he clearly had no problems ripping dingers to all fields with the wood bat. He very well might have the top hit/power combo in the FYPD class, and it's why Houston targeted him in the Kyle Tucker trade. The trade doesn't really change his value at all, but he will definitely get a nice ballpark upgrade even if he doesn't have the type of profile that necessarily needs it. - 2025 Projection: 12/4/17/.247/.308/.412/1 Prime Projection: 84/24/89/.273/.340/.466/4

41) Termarr Johnson - PIT, 2B, 20.10 - It only took 23 games in Johnson's 2022 pro debut to realize that his hit tool was overrated coming of the draft, and that started to scare people off in 2023 and 2024 when that became even more glaringly obvious with a .244 BA and .237 BA in those respective years. But Johnson was never just a hit tool only guy, he has real power and speed, so while the hit tool troubles prevent him from rising to near elite prospect status as hoped, it doesn't prevent him from still being a really exciting prospect. He swings an electric and powerful lefty bat that hits the ball really hard, resulting in 15 homers in 124 games, and his speed has always been a bit undersold, nabbing 22 bags. The hit tool isn't as good as hoped, but the 21.3% K% isn't bad at all, and he put up a 19.3% in 14 games when he got the call to Double-A as a 20 year old, which is exciting to see. He's also an on base machine with a 15.6% BB%. With him falling out of favor in the mainstream, now is a really good opportunity to buy low if you can, because when he produces in the upper minors as a still 20 year old, the hype is going to hit all over again. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/23/78/.262/.343/.452/15

42) Zyhir Hope - LAD, OF, 20.2 - And this is why "In the Dodgers We Trust" is a dynasty motto that should be burned into our retinas. They take Hope, and turn it into reality. Hope was a high risk, high reward upside pick by the Cubs in 2023 who struck out 30.2% of the time in rookie ball in his pro debut. He got traded to the Dodgers in the off-season in the Michael Busch trade, and of course the Dodgers immediately drastically improved his only weakness, bringing the strikeout rate all the way down to 22.8% at mostly Single-A. There is still hit tool risk (he hit .228 with a 24.3% K% in 23 games in the AFL), but low to mid 20's hit tool risk is in an entirely other bucket than hovering around 30% hit tool risk. And the hit tool improved without impacting any other areas of his game, slashing .290/.419/.484 with 9 homers, 9 steals, a 22.8/15.1 K%/BB% and a 144 wRC+ in 61 games. The reasons he's not ranked even higher than this are because the ground ball rates are on the high side (45.1%), there is still hit tool risk, and his speed/stolen base skills seem to be more in the above average than truly great area. So a guy who swings and misses a lot, hits the ball on the ground, and doesn't run quite as much as we would like isn't necessarily a slam dunk. I'm saying this just as much to myself as I am to you, because it's hard not to fall head over heels for him. He hits the ball very hard, he's a great athlete, he's in a great organization, and he's done nothing but produce. I do feel some caution is warranted before really putting him into that near elite to elite prospect tier, but he's not too far off from that already. I'm thinking something like Randy Arozarena could be a good ceiling comp. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/22/81/.255/.338/.445/19

43) Lazaro Montes - SEA, OF, 20.5 - Montes has three big negatives that prevent me from ranking him even higher than this. The first is that the hit tool is a real concern with a 26.1% K% in his 1,067 PA career in the lower minors. The 2nd is that Seattle is simply an awful ballpark to hit in. And the third is that he's a very bad defensive player, and could end up DH only. That puts a ton of pressure on the bat, and as a lefty who hits righties much better than lefties, a strong side of a platoon power bat seems well within the range of outcomes. I do find it interesting that Bryce Eldridge has a nearly identical profile, and Eldridge is the darling of the prospect world while people seem lukewarm on Montes these days. I also prefer Eldridge, because the hit tool seems a bit safer, he's a true unicorn at 6'7'', and he at least seems to have found a defensive home at 1B, but Montes is right there with him. He has beastly power at 6'3'', 210 pounds with 21 homers in 116 games, he's an on base machine with a 14.4% BB%, and while the K% spiked to 29.6% when he got the call to High-A, it was starting to come down towards the end of the season, and seeing the 19.1% K% he put up at Single-A shows hope that he can improve that skill over time. He's one of the premier lower minors power hitting prospects in the game, and his hype deserves to be damn close, if not equal to Eldridge's, but the prospect world can be a fickle place. Even my ranking has a disparity between them, Maybe it's just the nature of rankings. They are imperfect. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/33/95/.246/.333/.490/4

44) Hagen Smith - CHW, LHP, 21.7 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the White Sox know a thing or two about developing vicious lefty starters with funky deliveries and some control risk. They've done just fine with Chris Sale, Garrett Crochet, and Noah Schultz. The 6'3'', 225 pound Hagen Smith is next on that list with a three quarter arm slot delivery that he uses to fire a double plus mid 90's fastball and double plus slider. Both pitches are whiff machines, leading to a 2.04 ERA with a 48.6%/10.3% K%/BB% in 84 IP in the SEC. He also mixes in a splitter, and while he doesn't throw it that often, it's a good pitch when he goes to it. The walk rate is on the high side, and it was worse in his freshman and sophomore seasons with a 13.4% BB% in 148.3 IP. Improving his control/command and turning his splitter into a higher usage 3rd weapon can turn Smith into a true ace. If he can't improve in those areas, a high K, mid-rotation starter is within the range of outcomes (and I guess the bullpen is too, but you don't take a guy 6th overall to use him in the bullpen long term). I'm surprised that Smith was allowed to debut in 2024, but Chicago marches to the beat of their own drum. He more than held his own at High-A with a 3.52 ERA and 21.2/6.1 K%/BB% in 7.2 IP over 3 outings. The filthy stuff was as advertised, and while the K numbers weren't off the charts, it's nice to see that clean walk rate. Add a star for being young for the class, but take a star away for already undergoing Tommy John when he was 16 years old. - 2025 Projection: 2/3.91/1.28/50 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/203 in 175 IP

45) Thomas White - MIA, LHP, 20.6 - White is in the pole position to be the top pitching prospect in baseball by this time next year (with Travis Sykora and Alejandro Rosario right on his tail). He's a built up 6'5'' lefty with such dominant stuff that he basically slept walked through the lower minors. He quickly got the call to High-A and put up a 2.61 ERA with a 29.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 62 IP. He throws from an easy and athletic three quarter arm slot delivery which he uses to fire a mid 90's fastball that completely overpowered lower minors hitters. He also has a plus breaking ball that he will use in any count to go along with a lesser used, but still very good changeup. He's not a finished product as he'll have some bouts of control problems, and he needs to continue to refine all 3 of his pitches really, but for his first year out of high school, that is an insanely impressive first full year of pro ball. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.39/1.15/215 in 185 IP

46) Travis Sykora - WAS, RHP, 20.11 - Like I wrote above, I have White as the favorite to be the #1 pitching prospect in baseball by this time next year, because he did it at High-A for most of the season, but Sykora simply didn't get that opportunity. All he could do was obliterate the competition that was put in front of him, and obliterate he did with a 2.33 ERA and 39.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 85 IP at Single-A. He's a 6'6'', 232 pound beast with 3 at least plus pitches in his mid 90's fastball, slider and splitter. He doesn't have pinpoint control, but he throws the ball over the plate, and he doesn't have the most athletic looking delivery, but it's not unathletic either. Age to level doesn't matter nearly as much for pitchers as it does hitters, but I do think it's still something to take into account, so him being 20 years old at Single-A makes me want to see it at higher levels before truly crowning him. Regardless, this is easy ace upside, and his hype is going to blow up in 2025. He's the type you might want to stick your neck out to grab if he's out there in your off-season prospect draft. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.12/225 in 185 IP

47) Alejandro Rosario - TEX, RHP, 23.3 - The only box Rosario didn't check in 2024 was upper minors production, and while I do think that is a big step, even for pitchers, you can only dominate the competition that is put in front of you, and Rosario utterly dominated the lower minors. He put up a 2.24 ERA with a 36.9/3.7 K%/BB% in 88.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. He's 6'1'', 182 pounds with an athletic righty delivery that he uses to fire 3 potentially plus or better pitches. The fastball sit's in the mid to upper 90's and it's a bat missing weapon, He combines that with two plus secondaries in his slider and splitter, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out. The control was elite this season. He wasn't nearly this good in college (7.11 ERA with a 11.6% BB% in 74.2 IP his junior year), which is why he fell to 144th overall in the 2023 Draft, but Texas made some changes to his delivery and arsenal, giving reason to buy into the monster breakout. I would still like to see it in the upper minors first, and see him do it for a 2nd straight season in general, before truly valuing as an elite prospect, but if he dominates in his first start or two at Double-A in 2025, he will be a truly elite pitching prospect in the blink of an eye. White and Sykora have the more traditional path of size, youth, and pedigree, which is why my bet is on one of them to be the top dog in 2026, but maybe I'm sleeping on Rosario swooping in. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 13/3.52/1.18/189 in 170 IP

48) Jacob Melton - HOU, OF, 24.7 - Houston's OF is nothing but opportunity right now, with not a single locked in OF starter on the roster, which means Melton is going to get all of the opportunity he can handle in the coming years. And considering how great of an athlete he is, I love the leash he is almost certain to get. He's 6'2'', 208 pounds with plus speed and above average power. He cracked 15 homers with 30 steals in 105 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The reason why I'm so excited by the opportunity and leash, is that he might need it as the hit tool and plate approach are below average with a 23.5/7.0 K%/BB%. He's also not a huge lift and pull guy, which isn't the worst thing for his type of profile (speed and hard hit ability), and it doesn't go extreme in the way direction either, so I'm not too worried about that. Is it possible he ends up a kinda fringy major leaguer who shows flashes but just doesn't have the hit/plate approach to thrive? For sure that is a very realistic outcome. But I lean upside for fantasy, which Melton has plenty of, and when you combine it with proximity and opportunity, that is a profile I want on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 21/6/24/.228/.292/.402/8 Prime Projection: 77/19/75/.248/.319/.438/24

49) Heston Kjerstad - BAL, 1B/OF, 26.1 - Baltimore just doesn't seem interested in the slightest to give Kjerstad a real shot. He's once again blocked after the Tyler O'Neill signing. It seems obvious they want to use him as trade bait, but I guess nobody has bitten so far (that could change as they are still on the hunt for pitching). It's a shame, because he's clearly overdo for his shot. He smoked Triple-A with 16 homers, a 26.0/12.4 K%/BB%, and a 152 wRC+ in 56 games. It came with a 90.7 MPH EV and 16.8 degree launch. And then he was really good in the majors with 4 homers, a 116 wRC+ and 90.2 MPH EV in 114 PA. The swing and miss was on the high side with a 31.3% whiff% and 28.9% K%, but neither of those are too bad, and he also chased a lot with a 35% Chase%, so he needs to refine the plate skills, but that is to be expected with such little MLB experience. He's not a great defensive player, so he's definitely going to have to rake to hold down a job, but if he doesn't rake, it doesn't matter for us anyway. I love betting on the pedigree (2nd overall pick in the draft), history of production, and hard hit ability, but without opportunity, none of it matters. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/77/.250/.328/.440/3 (this assumes he gets traded to a situation where he can compete for a full time job. If he doesn't, you can half these projections at least)

50) Kevin Alcantara - CHC, OF, 22.8 - The Forgotten Unicorn continues to fly just low enough under the radar to not have the hype explode, while continuing to perform very well and show off his truly special tools. He's a still projectable 6'6'', 188 pounds with a double plus raw power/speed combo. He put up a 91 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 29.2 ft/sec sprint in the majors. And it's not like he's struggled in the minors at all, He's actually been extremely good his entire career, never putting up a wRC+ under 123 at any stop other than when he was a 16 year old in rookie ball. This year he did it in the upper minors all season as a 21/22 year old, slashing .278/.353/.428 with 14 homers, 14 steals, and a 26.0/9.9 K%/BB% in 111 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. The cherry on top is that he's a good CF, which could make a potent OF with PCA in center and Alcantara in a corner down the line. He's not a finished product with hit tool risk and too many groundballs, but his hype should be so much higher than it is. Alcantara makes for a great upside target. 2025 Projection: 22/7/29/.229/.294/.407/6 Prime Projection: 79/23/78/.251/.328/.449/18

51) Charlie Condon - COL, 3B/1B/OF, 21.11 - Let me just start by saying that I've been valuing pro debuts extremely high from the second I started writing back in 2015/16, and it has served me extremely well in both directions (moving guys both up and down). It was back before any other outlet would even consider changing their evaluation or ranking of a player based on their pro debut. When asked, they would just hand wave it away and say something like "small sample," even though the sample was often actually bigger in pro ball than it was in their Junior year of college (back when the draft was in early June). It made no sense to me why the pro debut with wood bats and more advanced pitching wouldn't be weighed more heavily. And now, you see basically every outlet change their ranking at least somewhat based on the pro debuts, which is the right move. That brings us to Charlie Condon, who just had the type of pro debut you have nightmares over. Despite all of his pre draft hype, he did have some hit tool questions at 6'6'' with relatively high K rates throughout his college career. And the hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball with a .180 BA and 31.2/3.7 K%/BB% in 25 games at High-A. That isn't just bad, that is atrocious. Completely lost. It's not great that the only question he had coming out of the draft was immediately answered, and not in a good way. This was a 21 year old in the lower minors. You need a high FYPD college bat to dominate in the majors by like 23 years old, let alone High-A. Jacob Berry and Chase Davis were the last two hyped college bats to have poor pro debuts, and neither of their values are anywhere close to where you wanted them to be. Condon is a better prospect than both of those guys, and I'm not dropping him as far down as those guys at all, but I do believe he does deserve a real drop. This draft class was already really tightly packed at the top with a lot of really, really good college talent, but no one true standout. So based on Condon's poor debut, I don't see how it doesn't make complete sense to drop him under those guys. He has a clear carrying tool in his power, and of course I do factor in that the pro debut was at the end of a long season, draft process, new team, new coach, new everything etc ..., so he's still a Top 10 FYPD pick for me. I still like him as a power bat who will get to hit in Coors (but also gets their developmental team, and it looks like he still needs development). I just wouldn't be able to pull the trigger on him until the other similarly talented college players with better debuts were off the board first. I feel like that's reasonable. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/30/88/.241/.322/.472/8

52) Braden Montgomery - CHW, OF, 22.0 - Selected 12th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, there was a lot of talk about Montgomery dropping his righty swing to hit exclusively lefty. That doesn't really seem like what you want to hear from a highly drafted college bat, but the lefty swing is so smooth and powerful I get why it doesn't seem like that big of a deal overall. He also had a 20% K% which is substantially higher than the college bats drafted before him. Maybe that is partly why he slipped a bit to 12th overall, and also why Boston was willing to include him in the Crochet trade. The broken ankle which he suffered pre draft on June 8th was also likely a major reason for the drop. So he certainly has some risk with hit tool, platooning and injury, but he also has very major power upside. He's 6'2'', 220 pounds and he smashed 27 homers with a 1.187 OPS in 61 games in the SEC. He's been smashing homers his entire career with 62 homers in 187 games split between the Pac 12 and SEC. He absolutely destroys the baseball with huge exit velocities. That gives him a no doubt carrying tool that will make him a fantasy force. As for the trade, it really doesn't change his value at all. The path to playing time is clearer, but it's an organization downgrade and a future lineup downgrade. It's also a ballpark downgrade. If anything, it makes me like him slightly less, but again, this really shouldn't change his value too much. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/28/89/.251/.333/.475/6

53) Jac Caglionone - KCR, 1B, 22.2 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Caglionone's pro debut was on the disappointing side, and with how tightly packed the talent is in the FYPD Top 12, he's sliding down my rankings to the bottom of that Top 12 tier. He had hit tool and chase questions coming out of the draft, and hitting .241 with a 20.6/5.6 K%/BB% in his 29 game pro debut at High-A did nothing to quell those issues. He put up a lowly 94 wRC+ with 2 homers, which isn't what you want to see from an elite college bat in the lower minors. He then went to the AFL where the pitching was so bad this year, they are actively trying to figure out how to improve the pitchers in that league in future years, and he still couldn't dominate with a .749 OPS in 21 games. Tons of hitters were putting up just wacky numbers in that extreme offensive environment. He did jack 5 homers, and there is zero doubt about his massive power, so there is no doubt he has a carrying tool even if the hit tool and plate approach take time to adjust to pro pitching. He's built like an NFL tight end at 6'5'', 250 pounds, and he obliterated the SEC with 75 homers in 165 career games. It took him some time to improve his plate skills in college as well, making big improvements his junior year with a 8.2/18.4 K%/BB% (18.2/5.3 K%/BB% his sophomore year), so the hope is that he can do the same in the majors. KC's ballpark is death to lefty homers, and while I am factoring that in a bit, he has the type of power to not get too hung up on it. Even though the pro debut does have him sliding down the rankings a bit, it's almost more because of how much comparable college talent there is at the top of this class to begin with. He's still a very exciting power bat. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/31/92/.248/.329/.479/6

54) Kevin McGonigle - DET, SS/2B, 20.7 - McGonigle had one of the best hit tools in the high school class, and while this is generally a bucket of prospect that I don't go after in first year player drafts, McGonigle showed what it looks like when that profile goes right. He slashed .309/.401/.452 with 5 homers, 22 steals, and a 8.5/14.0 K%/BB% in 74 games split between Single-A and High-A. He proved he wasn't just hit tool though, hitting the ball pretty hard with a 88.9 MPH EV at Single-A, and also showing base stealing skills (22 for 24 on the bases). He didn't have any groundball issues and he pulled the ball a lot (well over 50% pull rate). Even during the regular season I got too locked into him as a hit tool guy, when there is more to his skillset than that. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10", 187 pounds, and I still see more of a moderate power/speed combo, so I still don't mind my Stevan Kwan 2.0 comp, but McGonigle is already hitting the ball harder (and pulling the ball a lot more), so he can end up a souped up version of Kwan. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 92/15/58/291/.362/.422/21

55) Jett Williams - NYM, SS/OF, 21.5 - Jett's season was a straight disaster. He underwent surgery on his right wrist just 11 games into the season and he didn't return until the end of the August. Wrist injuries are known killers for hitters, so it's not surprising to see he wasn't great after returning from the injury either with 0 homers and a .656 OPS in 33 games on the season. I would call it a completely lost year, but if there is one small silver lining to take out of it, it's that he was actually really good in his final 6 games at Triple-A. He had a 192 wRC+ with a 89.6 MPH EV. I know it's just 6 games, but it shows how the 5'6'' Jett can truly pack a punch. He also proved the GB rates (around a 32% GB%) and the plate approach (23.6/14.9 K%/BB%) won't fall apart in the upper minors. Also keep in mind he was just 20 years old this year. Lift, speed, plate approach, and sneaky pop is a potent fantasy combination, and with Williams' injury induced down year, I'm sensing some major buy low opportunities this winter. This is an electric player, size be damned. - 2025 Projection: 16/2/10/.238/.305/.385/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/66/.264/.345/.438/32

56) Jonny Farmelo - SEA, OF, 20.7 - Farmelo was on his way to becoming a legitimate possibility for Top 20 prospect status by this off-season, but he tore his ACL on June 11th after just 46 games. It was a non contact injury while tracking a line drive to centerfield. A lot of the excitement around him was due to his double plus speed and elite athleticism, so a torn knee kinda takes a shot directly to that strength. We've also seen guys tear their knee, and then keep tearing their knee again (or tear their other knee), like Kyle Lewis, Royce Lewis, and Ronald Acuna. On the flip side, we see NFL running backs return from torn ACL's and get their explosion back, so at only 20 years old, I'm expecting Farmelo to retain most of his elite athleticism, but it's certainly not good. And the injury is also expected to keep him out until mid-season 2025. So it could be hard for him to truly get the hype fully rolling again until 2026. Even with all that, I remain high on him because his upside is no joke. He slashed .264/.398/.421 with 4 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.5/16.3 K%/BB% in 46 games at Single-A. He's 6'2'', 205 pounds with a powerful lefty swing and low groundball rates (34.1% GB%). He was thought to be on the raw side coming out of the draft, and while there is still hit tool risk, he showed a good feel to hit with an excellent approach in his debut. Assuming full health, he could be a beast, and even with the injury risk (and also the general risk of being a 19 year old in the lower minors), he should be considered a pretty sought after dynasty prospect.

57) Chase Dollander - COL, RHP, 23.5 - In a Baseball America Youtube interview (The Hot Sheet Show is a great show in general), Dollander mentioned that he's literally not planning ahead at all, and doing absolutely nothing different for the looming Coors Field that awaits him. The Rockies literally don't prepare their pitchers at all for eventually pitching with different air. That makes total sense to me based on how bad their franchise is. If I was heading up a franchise where the ballpark had different air, and their entire history of pitching in that environment was nothing short of horrific, the strategies necessary to thrive in that environment would run deep throughout my organization from rookie ball on up. Dollander answered the question as if nobody has even mentioned it to him ha. I just find that kinda wild. Now, maybe trying to change who you are as a pitcher would only get in your head, and maybe there literally is no good strategy for it, so I guess you might as well not think about it. I'm open to that being the case, but either way, for fantasy purposes, it just reinforces that I'm never going to be the high guy on Colorado pitching prospects, It sure seems like if anyone can slay the beast, it will be Dollander, and as a baseball fan, I'm rooting for him hardcore to be the one who breaks through. A true ace at Coors would be awesome. If we forget about Coors for a second, Dollander is an elite pitching prospect on his own merits with a 2.59 ERA and 33.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 118 IP at High-A and Double-A (he was equally dominant at both stops). The mid to upper 90's fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon, which he combines with a 3 secondaries (gyro slider, curve, change) that aren't as good as the fastball, but can be above average to plus pitches in their own right. Below average control is the only other demerit besides Coors Field. I've had a zero tolerance policy for Coors pitching prospects my entire life, and it has yet to come back to bite me. Maybe Dollander will be the one to finally make me regret it, and I'm genuinely rooting for him to be the one, even if it won't happen on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 4/4.28/1.33/96 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.79/1.24/185 in 170 IP

58) Brandon Sproat - NYM, RHP, 24.6 - Baseball likes to make it as hard as possible to evaluate minor league players, and pitchers in particular. They love to use minor leaguers as guinea pigs, which I get, but life would be a lot easier if things were at least a bit more standardized among all levels. There was literally different rules for calling balls and strikes at Triple-A in the first 3 games of a series (fully automated) vs. the last 3 (umps call it with a automated challenge system). Then they switched the rules mid-season to just the automated challenge system with the umps calling them the rest of the time. Every level also uses different balls. Triple-A uses the MLB ball, while lower levels don't. Enter Brandon Sproat, who utterly dominated at Double-A with a 2.45 ERA and 33.2/6.5 K%/BB% in 62.1 IP, only to completely fall apart at Triple-A with a 7.53 ERA and 16.3/8.5 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP. Was it the ball? Was it the strikezone? Was it the better competition? Was it that he was reaching a career high in IP? Was it a combo of everything? I don't know exactly, but what I do know is that the stuff was still nasty. The 4-seamer sits 96.6 MPH and he has 2 potentially plus secondaries in his slider and changeup which both miss bats and induce weak contact. He also throws a cutter, curve and sinker, giving him a very diverse pitch mix. His control was below average throughout his college career, and it also was poor at the start of the season at High-A, so there is still some control/command risk in here even though he took a big step forward in that department overall. Does it worry me a bit that his numbers tanked so hard when he used the MLB baseball for the first time? It does. But at the end of the day the stuff don't lie, and Sproat has monster stuff. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.08/1.32/87 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.63/1.20/189 in 170 IP

59) Trey Sweeney - DET, SS, 24.11 - Sweeney was one of my favorite proximity stashes during the 2024 season, even moving him into my Top 100 at some point, and his MLB debut just emboldened my love for him. He's 6'3'', 212 pounds with a 74.1 MPH swing which is in double plus territory. It resulted in a 91.1 MPH EV with a 12.8 degree launch. His 28.1 ft/sec sprint speed is above average to plus, stealing 16 bags in 96 games at Triple-A and 3 bags in 43 games in the majors (including the playoffs). He was also a plus defender at SS. This is a pretty special athlete here. His .642 OPS in 36 games isn't super impressive, he didn't exactly dominate Triple-A with a 88 wRC+, and there is hit tool risk with a 32.4% whiff%. But all of those are more than baked into his price, overly so in my opinion. My attention is on the things he does well, and that makes him a very enticing target relative to his perceived value. - 2025 Projection: 71/18/76/.237/.308/.416/11 Prime Projection: 83/22/78/.252/.328/.444/14

60) Luisangel Acuna - NYM, SS/2B, 23.1 - Acuna was in the midst of an extremely lackluster season at Triple-A with a 69 wRC+ in 131 games, but maybe he was just getting bored, because he gave his dynasty value a shot to the arm in his cup of coffee in the bigs. He jacked out 3 homers with a 91 MPH EV, 15% K% and 165 wRC+ in 40 PA. He might not be as good as his older brother, but the electric Acuna blood most certainly runs through his veins with a near elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed and a plus 73.5 MPH bat speed. He's only 5'10'', and the 87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A wasn't as impressive, but there is real juice in his bat, especially as he continues to get stronger. He's a game changer on the bases with 40 steals at Triple-A, and he's put up strong contact rates at every level, including the majors. He only had a 2.5% BB% in the majors, but he really didn't chase a concerning amount with a 30.8% Chase%. The Mets are a wild card this off-season, so I hesitate to try to project their lineup right now, but he can play SS, 2B, and CF, which means he can basically play any position on the field, so that versality will keep his bat in the lineup if he's producing. He looks like a mighty enticing dynasty asset right now. - 2025 Projection: 73/12/61/.256/.309/.394/23 Prime Projection: 84/16/69/.272/.328/.426/30

61) Zach Dezenzo - HOU, 1B, 24.11 - Houston is planning on using Dezenzo at 1B and LF in 2025, which works just fine because Houston has nothing but opportunity in their OF. He also has an offensive profile that I am super excited about. He's going to have to earn it every step of the way, so he's not the type of target I am going to stick my neck out for, but he is 100% a "let him come to you" target for me. He's 6'5'', 220 pounds with an elite 75.4 MPH swing and a well above average 28.3 ft/sec sprint. We are talking about an absolutely elite, electric athlete here. He wasn't great in his MLB debut with a 33.8/4.6 K%/BB% and 84 wRC+ in 19 games, so the hit tool is definitely a risk, but his 31.7% whiff% wasn't too bad, and he dominated Triple-A with a 149 wRC+ and 22.1/13.3/ K%/BB% in 25 games. I'm willing to take on that extra risk for the type of athlete he is. Don't reach, but definitely put a big star next to Dezenzo's name and hope he falls right into your lap. 2025 Projection: 62/15/69/.248/.312/.422/9 Prime Projection: 83/20/79/.262/.337/.444/15

62) Ronny Mauricio - NYM, 2B, 24.0 - I'm fighting off the prospect creep of "out of sight, out of mind," because even when you are aware of that mind virus, it can still take a hold of you. Mauricio missed all of 2024 after undergoing surgery for a torn ACL that he suffered after a non contact injury on the bases in Winter Ball. It was deju vu all over again with Edwin Diaz tearing his knee in the WBC the off-season before that, but Diaz came back to basically full strength this season, and Mauricio can do the same in 2025. He hit the ball very hard with a 90.7 MPH EV in 26 games in the majors and a 91.1 MPH EV at Triple-A, he loves to run with 7 steals in the majors and 24 steals at Triple-A, and he gets the bat on the ball with a 18.2% K% at Triple-A. That K% jumped to 28.7% in the majors, he chases a ton, he hits the ball on the ground a lot and despite loving to run, he's not a burner. He doesn't really have the speed to lose, so the knee injury is definitely concerning in the stolen base department at the least.. I definitely have the pull to drop him down the rankings, but I'm fighting it with everything I have, because at full strength, Mauricio has a very fantasy friendly skillset. - 2025 Projection: 37/10/46/.248/.304/.419/8 Prime Projection: 75/22/77/.267/.325/.454/16

63) Spencer Jones - NYY, OF, 23.11 - Extremely high strikeout rate hitters often straddle that imaginary line between "he'll hit enough for the huge talent to blow up" and "he can't hit, making the huge talent worthless." It often results in a very black or white ranking, because if you think they will hit enough, they get ranked extremely high, and if you don't think they will hit enough, you might erase them completely from your rankings. I like to live in the Grey (not Grey as in Razzball Grey, that would just be odd, but Grey as in the Queen's English of gray), so while I'm obviously less than enthused with Jones' 36.8% K% in 122 games at Double-A, I don't want to just banish him to purgatory. His talent is just too huge to do that at 6'6'', 235 pounds with an at least plus power/speed combo. And even with all of the strikeouts, he still showed out in the upper minors with 17 homers, 25 steals, and a 124 wRC+. He doesn't have to bring the K rate down to like the mid 20's, he can survive in the low 30's. Jones isn't Elly, but we saw the season Elly just put up with a 31.3% K%. The extremely high K rate rate definitely hurts his value (at least he's no Elijah Green and his 44% K%), but I don't think it means you should write him off. The upside is too high, and I don't think the hit tool is hopeless. He's still a Top 75 Prospect for me. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.217/.290/.399/4 Prime Projection: 75/21/79/.238/.317/.436/21

64) Cade Horton - CHC, RHP, 23.7 - Horton's season ended after just 34.1 IP with a lat strain, and let's hope that lat strain is what led to his terrible run at Triple-A. He put up a 7.50 ERA with a 27.2/13.6 K%/BB% in 18 IP. The fastball was down to 94.1 MPH. The good news is that the secondaries (changeup, curve, slider) still missed a ton of bats and induced weak contact, and he also pitched much better at Double-A with a 1.10 ERA and 29.0/3.2 K%/BB% in 16.1 IP. We can give him a pass for his performance at Triple-A due to the injury, but Tommy John surgery knocked out his entire 2021 season, so injuries are starting to become a concern. He's never pitched more than 88.1 IP in a season, so it's a question if he can truly put up a full starter's workload year after year, and also what level of stuff he can hold over those innings. His value took a hit this year, but it would be too risk averse to completely tank his value. I'm holding relatively strong. 2025 Projection: 4/4.13/1.32/74 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.68/1.19/163 in 150 IP

65) Moises Ballesteros - CHC, C, 21.5 - Ballesteros is a below average defensive catcher which makes it unclear if he will end up sticking behind the plate. He's only 21 years old, so maybe he'll improve, and maybe Chicago will be fine with his below average defense because they are not strong at catcher in both the majors and the minors. Even if Ballesteros moves off catcher to 1B/DH, he definitely has the bat to clear that high bar. He possesses one of the best hit/power combos in the minors, slashing .289/.354/.471 with 19 homers, 1 steal, and a 18.3/8.9 K%/BB% in 124 games split between Double-A (154 wRC+) and Triple-A (106 wRC+). And keep in mind he did that as a 20 year old. He started to lift and pull the ball more at Triple-A, which spiked his K rate a bit, but we'll take that tradeoff for more dingers. Lack of defensive value can certainly end up a real issue if his bat ends up more above average than great, but Chicago has every incentive for him to stick behind the plate, so I'm leaning he gets a real shot there. - 2025 Projection: 33/9/39/.258/.307/.420/1 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.275/.332/.450/2

66) Colson Montgomery - CHW, SS, 23.1 - Montgomery had a pretty damn bad season at Triple-A with 18 homers, an 85.8 MPH EV, a 28.6/12.0 K%/BB% and an 88 wRC+ in 130 games. I've talked about this in a previous year's Strategy Section, but it's easy to assume every down year for a prospect is him regressing as a player, and every monster year is a true breakout, rather than it sometimes just being a down year or a career year. So even though I was a bit lower than most last year on Montgomery, writing, "Those are the reasons that make me hesitant to rank him as high as I see him in other places, but there is no denying he is a damn good prospect no matter how you slice it," I'm still not going to jump ship. His profile remains the same for me as a 6'3'', 225 pound slugger with a clear path to playing time. He also came into the AFL fired up to wash the slate clean with 3 homers, a 6/10 K/BB, and a 1.167 OPS in 11 games, which shows everything you liked about him last off-season is still in here. Hold strong - 2025 Projection: 58/18/65/.223/.296/.411/3 Prime Projection: 82/26/88/.247/.332/.465/7

67) Adael Amador - COL, 2B, 22.0 - I warned that Amador's elite hit tool would take a step back in the upper minors in my Predicting the 2025 Top 50 Prospects Rankings last off-season, writing," Amador's strikeout rate won't be as elite in the upper minors as it was in the lower minors, and like many Rockies hitters who go from their hitter's park haven at High-A to their more neutral Double-A park, the offensive production won't be as eye popping. His value won't tank but it won't explode either." ... that is essentially exactly what happened with a .230 BA and 19.3/13.6 K%/BB% in 100 games. And his value actually tanked more than I thought it would, but I'm not sure it deserves to tank that hard. The .261 BABIP shows he was definitely on the unlucky side, and he still had 14 homers, 35 steals, and a 111 wRC+, so it was far from a disaster season. Colorado rushed him to the majors for 10 games in June because they are one of the weirdest franchises out there, but I would ignore those numbers. The 2B job is wide open for him, and while the power likely ends up below average, the hit, plate approach, and speed can certainly make a fantasy impact. - 2025 Projection: 28/5/26/.246/.305/.371/10 Prime Projection: 84/17/62/.273/.341/.426/27

68) Brice Matthews - HOU, SS, 23.0 - Matthews was one of my top targets from his FYPD class because I saw an explosive athlete when watching him, and he proved that explosiveness will translate to the upper minors in 2024, slashing .265/.384/.481 with 15 homers, 32 steals, and a 31.4/13.4 K%/BB% in 79 games at mostly Double-A (but also rookie, High-A and Triple-A). I wish I could raise the victory flag and truly explode him up the rankings, but unfortunately the hit tool was a bit worse than hoped. He was hanging in there with a 26.8% K% at High-A, but it immediately jumped to 33.7% at Double-A, and then 39.6% to close out in the season in 12 games at Triple-A. He's now in the Puerto Rican Winter League and has a 35.3% K% in 20 games. Sure he's 5.4 years younger than average in that league, but he's already a 22 year old college bat who could conceivably break into the majors this year, so he's not that young for that level really. The dude obviously has a very real strikeout problem, and I can't just gloss over it. I comped him to Tommy Pham last year, and I predicted like Pham, it could take into his mid 20's for the hit tool to click, but when it does click, the returns will be very big. I'm sticking with that timeline. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/74/.233/.318/.431/26

69) Owen Caissie - CHC, OF, 22.9 - Caissie is a super easy evaluation as a low BA, high OBP slugger, but he really doesn't hit as many homers as you would think with 19 homers in 127 games at Triple-A. His 33.4% FB% is on the low side for a slugger, which is what is holding down the homer totals. It's helping his BA, hitting .278, but with a 28.4% K% (which is a career best), he's not going to hit for a high BA in the majors regardless. There could be a scenario where the strikeout rate is hovering around 30% in the majors with a launch that really isn't all that high, which could result in some pretty mediocre numbers. I mainly bring this up because it's the most interesting thing about projecting his future value, but when you pan out for the big picture, he's a powerful and athletic 6'3'', 190 pounds with current plus power and possibly more coming down the line. He'll also chip in with steals, nabbing 11 bags. And add two stars in OBP leagues with a 12.9% BB%. I don't want to lose the forest through the trees by slicing and dicing the numbers too much, so I'm still projecting his as a low BA, high OBP slugger no matter how you slice it. There is a short term logjam for playing time, but long term I don't see many roadblocks. 2025 Projection: 19/6/25/.227/.303/.420/2 Prime Projection: 78/28/91/.246/.335/.480/7

70) Orelvis Martinez - TOR, 2B/3B, 23.5 - Martinez got popped with an 80 game PED suspension in June, and I'm honestly struggling to figure out how much to dock him for that. I didn't dock Tatis much for his PED suspension, and that turned out to be a good move. But Tatis was an established MLB superstar already. I then followed suit by not docking Noelvi Marte much, and that looks like a mistake with him possibly being the worst player in MLB last year, dropping off everywhere you look. Martinez clearly fits better into the Noelvi mold than Tatis mold, but everyone is their own person, and I don't want Marte's season to influence Martinez' ranking too much for me. Martinez returned in September and he put up a .882 OPS with 1 homer in 11 games at Triple-A, so that is a good sign that the suspension won't impact him that much. And before the suspension, he was beasting the league with 17 homers, a 13.1% Barrel%, 46.1% Hard Hit%, 23.8/8.5 K%/BB%, and a 120 wRC+ in 74 games. His power is no joke with 30+ potential on the MLB level. Toronto traded for Gimenez, but 3B is still open for the taking, and it wouldn't be crazy to see Martinez win that role pretty quickly into 2025 (pending any off-season moves). I'm going to stay a bit restrained here because of the suspension, but I don't want to be overly scared off. This is a big time power bat who is knocking on the door of the bigs with opportunity. I'm cautiously buying. - 2025 Projection: 36/12/43/.229/.298/.422/1 Prime Projection:  76/28/87/.247/.323/.477/3

71) Jacob Misiorowski - MIL, RHP, 23.0 - The hope was that Misiorowski's control/command would take a step forward this season, but it just didn't happen. He put up a 14.4% BB% in 97.1 IP at mostly Double-A. They moved him into the bullpen when he got the call to Triple-A, and the control didn't improve in short outings either with a 14.3% BB%. He finished the season with a 3.33 ERA and 30.5/14.4 K%/BB%. His evaluation basically remains exactly the same from last off-season. He's 6'7'', 190 pounds with premium stuff and super high upside. The upper 90's fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon and his breaking balls are plus and miss bats. You hate to say it, but it is really a reliever profile right now. It's far too early into his development process to write him off as a starter though, and I highly doubt Milwaukee is ready to do that either. Even if he breaks into the majors in the bullpen, he will definitely be a candidate to get transitioned back into the rotation at some point too. I'll keep betting on the huge stuff and let the chips fall where they may. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.91/1.34/67 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.58/1.27/183 in 150 IP

72) Josue Briceno - DET, C/1B, 20.6 - As the world's foremost expert on Josue's, I presented you with the first zero hype Josue to pick up as quick as possible in 2022 (Josue De Paula), and then knowing a good Josue when I see one, I did the same for the 2nd zero hype Josue in 2023 (Josue Briceno). Both of their hypes have grown considerably since then, and if not for a knee sprain knocking out 2 and a half months of Briceno's season, his hype could have been even more. But he's making up for lost time right now in the AFL, winning the MVP award with 10 homers and a 1.376 OPS in 25 games. Even with the knee injury and not really having a good regular season, he still ended up with a 123 wRC+, 89.8 MPH EV and 14.8/12.5 K%/BB% in 40 games at Single-A. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with a potentially special hit/power combo. He's likely a 1B long term, which is perfect for his type of bat. Even with his profile rising, it's still not enough. He remains a major target for me this off-season. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.275/.350/.488/3

73) Jarlin Susana - WASH, RHP, 21.1 - I called Susana the Hunter Greene starter pack that was still sitting in the plastic, waiting to be put together coming into this season, and well, he started to assemble those pieces in 2024. After a rough start, he caught fire, putting up a 2.79 ERA with a 39.4/9.3 K%/BB% in his final 77.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. The Greene comp is actually extremely on point for the similarly sized, 6'6'', 235 pound Susana with an upper 90's fastball that doesn't get enough movement, a double plus slider, below average control, and a developing splitter. The improvements that Greene made this season (turning the splitter into a legit third weapon and improving his fastball movement) are the same improvements Susana has to make as he continues to climb the ladder. He also needs to continue to improve his control/command, as he can start to look a big relievery at times. There is still plenty of risk here, but there is legit top of the rotation upside, and he could have a soft landing spot as an elite closer. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.55/1.26/187 in 165 IP

74) Ethan Salas - SDP, C, 18.10 - Salas is an example of where pushing your prospects too fast goes wrong, although what Salas did as a 17/18 year old at High-A has to be graded on a major curve, and most importantly, it doesn't matter what his numbers were this year. The only thing that matters is if he's developing to be an impact major league player down the line, so it's even too early to say it was a mistake. He slashed .206/.288/.311 with 4 homers, 10 steals, and a 20.9/10.0 K%/BB% in 111 games. The strong K/BB rate is important, because it shows he wasn't completely overmatched or anything. He was also a bit better towards the end of the season with a .723 OPS in his final 28 games, which he's carried over into the AFL with a .751 OPS in 23 games. And he hit really well in 2023 at Single-A, so he does have a track record to look at to not be overly concerned about this year. He's an excellent defensive catcher who will have no problems sticking behind the dish, and that will also juice up his trade value as he ranks extremely high on real life lists. Catchers get downgraded in fantasy in general, and while I do still like his bat a lot, there is a question about exactly how high his offensive upside is. I would value him as a really good prospect, but not an elite one. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/85/.269/.342/.468/9

75) Brady House - WAS, 3B, 21.10 - House hasn't had the elite prospect explosion we hoped for when he was a hyped high school bat, and his .241/.297/.402 triple slash with a 26.4/5.7 K%/BB% in 129 games split between Double-A and Triple-A isn't all that impressive either, but when evaluating prospects, you have to have an eye towards who they can be, rather than who they are today, and House can definitely still be a middle of the order power bat at peak. His power did take a step forward this year with 19 homers, and he's still a relatively svelte 6'4'', so I think there is more power coming when he gets into his man muscles years. Keep in mind he was just 21 years old in the upper minors, while hyped, similarly aged college bats were struggling or not exactly dominating in the lower minors. He needs to improve his hit tool and plate approach, which is why he isn't ranked higher on this list, but he still looks on track to be that middle of the order power bat we thought he could be. The Nationals 3B job is also wide open for the taking in both the short term and the long term. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/36/.230/.291/.408/4 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.253/.326/.457/9

76) Deyvison De Los Santos - MIA, 1B/3B, 21.9 - De Los Santos is a one tool player, but that tool is so massive and so important, that it just might overcome that he does nothing else well on a baseball field. And that thing is of course double plus power. He's a power hitting bull at 6'1'' with 40 homers and a 90.6 MPH EV in 137 games in the upper minors. He swings and misses a lot (24.6% K%), he doesn't walk (5.8% BB%), he hits the ball on the ground way too much (50%+ groundball rates), he's bad on defense, and he doesn't steal bases. There is actually one other thing going for him, which is that he's been very young for the upper minors in 2023-24, and he'll still be just 21 years old for almost half of the 2025 season. There is time for him to improve his plate skills and launch. If he can, he has the upside to be one of the best power hitters in baseball, but even if he can't, there is a role for a guy who can hit 30+ homers even if that is all he does well. Miami should also have plenty of opportunity for him if he's raking. - 2025 Projection: 61/22/72/.228/.280/.435/0 Prime Projection: 73/31/88/.256/.314/.495/2

77) Luke Keaschall - MIN, 2B/OF, 22.8 - Keaschall's season ended on August 8th with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery, but we all know by now that you don't need elbows to hit. Ohtani just went 54/59 while rehabbing from internal brace or whatever super secret surgery he underwent. Keaschall ain't Ohtani, but point being, I don't think the surgery should ding his value too much. And his value was starting to get pretty exciting with him proving the profile will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .281/.393/.439 with 8 homers, 9 steals, and a 19.1/12.0 K%/BB% in 58 games at Double-A. He doesn't have huge raw power, but he hits the ball fairly hard, and can definitely lift and pull it with a 35.3% GB% and 50.3% Pull%. He's got speed, he gets the bat on the ball, and he has a good approach. It's possible the good but not great tools will play down a bit on the major league level, and he's also not a particularly good defensive player, so he's going to have to hit. But a lift, speed, contact, approach profile is a lot of boxes to check, and the profile is fantasy friendly. - 2025 Projection: 18/4/12/.247/.304/.399/5 Prime Projection: 82/19/72/.266/.334/.436/19

78) Colby Thomas - OAK, OF, 24.2 - Colby Thomas comes to the plate with one thing in mind and one thing only ... well, maybe two things ... and those things are lifting it and pulling it. He has a relatively open batting stance that telegraphs his intentions, and he executes his plan with a 33% GB% and 54.5% Pull% at Triple-A which led to 17 homers in 73 games (31 homers in 132 games on the season). He's not necessarily a raw power beast at 5'10'', but he's pretty thick and he definitely has more than enough power to make his profile work. He's also a good athlete who stole 15 bases this season and 25 bags in 2023, which gives him that added upside bump to make him a very enticing proximity stash headed into 2025. The thing that can tank him is that the hit tool is very shaky with a 30.3/7.3 K%/BB% at Triple-A, and there is something about the batting stance which feels like it could get a bit exposed in the majors. The profile is actually very similar to Connor Norby, except Thomas has more raw power and runs more, while I trust Norby's hit tool more. Don't overextend yourself here, but he's definitely someone to put a star next to their name if you want to take an upside shot on someone who could very well break camp with the club. - 2025 Projection: 48/13/46/.229/.294/.420/10 Prime Projection: 75/23/78/.252/.318/.452/15

79) Denzel Clarke - OAK, OF, 24.11 - Back in 2023, I literally had Lawrence Butler and Denzel Clarke ranked back to back in my 2023 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings at #744 and #745. They both had extremely similar profiles. They are the same age, they are almost the same size, they are both excellent athletes with plus power/speed combos, they are both Oakland prospects, they are both outfielders, and they both had major swing and miss problems with strikeout rates north of 30% at High-A. But that is where their paths started to split, as Butler made extreme improvements to his strikeout rate, putting up a sub 20% K% in the upper minors in 2023 and 2024 (and obviously holding enough of those gains in the majors), while Clarke's strikeout rate remained in the 30%+ area ... that is until the 2nd half of this season. From June 12th on, Clarke slashed .317/.387/.524 with 9 homers, 30 steals and a 23.5/8.6 K%/BB% in 73 games at Double-A. Granted, he did it two years after Butler, so age to level isn't as impressive, and he also had to lower his launch to do it with a 50.5% GB%, but that is still a major improvement to see, because like Butler, he has the type of power/speed combo to make a major fantasy impact. Even with the lower launch, he has the power and speed to make that type of profile work. I've been heavily debating Colby Thomas vs. Clarke, and while I gave the nod to Thomas because I trust his hit tool and launch more, I think Clarke has the upside nod. He's a definite target this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 28/7/32/.220/.289/.397/9 Prime Projection: 76/20/74/.244/.318/.430/25

80) Ryan Clifford - NYM, 1B/OF, 21.8 - After hitting only 1 homer in 31 games in New York's tough High-A ballpark (although he didn't hit any homers on the road either), Clifford got the call to Double-A as a still 20 year old and lived up to his big power profile. He jacked out 18 homers with a 133 wRC+ and 28.9/15.6 K%/BB% in 98 games. Even at High-A he put up a 124 wRC+, which is the sign of a good player who can still produce when the homers aren't coming (or it's a sign that High-A pitchers just didn't want to pitch to him with a 23.5% BB%). Clifford was one of my favorite targets in his first year player draft class because he looked like a sure bet to become an exciting power hitting prospect, and that is exactly what he's become. The strikeouts are too high to really put him into that elite tier, but I wouldn't rule out him improving there at a still young 21 years old. Even if he can't, the power will play on any level. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/31/90/.239/.324/.491/4

81) Cam Collier - CIN, 3B, 20.4 - Collier might be the most underrated power hitting prospect in the minors. He's a big physical guy at 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful and quick lefty swing that is made to do damage, so he most certainly looks the part. It's what got him drafted 18th overall. And now he has the production part too with a blow up season at High-A as a 19 year old. He smashed 20 homers with a 25.0/13.0 K%/BB% and 129 wRC+ in 119 games. He crushes the ball and the power is at least plus. Age to level production, EV, pedigree, approach, eye test, great eventual home ballpark ... Collier has a ton of things going for him, and he really gets barely any hype. There is definitely hit tool risk, but that often comes with the package for young power hitters. Don't underrate Collier. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/29/93/.252/.333/.486/5

82) Xavier Isaac - TBR, 1B, 21.4 - Isaac was always a power over hit prospect, but his hit tool risk shot into the stratosphere this year. He put up a 30.1% K% in 71 games at High-A, and then it got even worse at Double-A with a 40.6% in 31 games. It stayed that bad when he went to the AFL too with a 40.3% in 15 games. He clearly has a major, major problem. He wasn't nearly this bad in 2023 with a 21.3% K%, so while this didn't come completely out of nowhere, it's definitely much worse than expected. He crushes the ball with 18 homers in 102 games, he's a good athlete with 15 steals in 18 attempts, he gets on base with a 13.3% BB%, and he's very young, so he's still a very exciting prospect, but it prevents him from jumping into that elite or near elite tier coming into 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/28/86/.240/.324/.469/10

83) Zac Veen - COL, OF, 23.4 - Long gone are the days where Veen is a major prospect target for me. The book is far from written on him, but I think it's more than fair to say he is one of my biggest misses in terms of ranking him as a near elite prospect a couple years ago. The development simply hasn't happened like I thought it could, and him being a Rockies prospect, yea, maybe I should have seen that coming. But just because he hasn't blown up, doesn't mean he's still not a pretty enticing fantasy prospect. As I expected, he bounced back from an injury induced down year in 2023, slashing .259/.346/.459 with 11 homers, 21 steals in 25 attempts, and a 24.8/11.1 K%/BB% in 65 games at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. We saw a power uptick that we were waiting for, but it was more of a moderate power uptick than a true explosion. And once again, his year was marred by injuries with a back and thumb injury, which once again sapped some power when he returned. I don't know whether to think the constant injuries are hiding that upside that made me fall in love originally, or if he's simply injury prone and it's something that should be a demerit on his profile. Maybe a little of both. What makes him so exciting for fantasy is his speed and base running ability, which are at least plus, and he also has a good glove in the OF, which could get him on the field. The strikeout rates are elevated and the power looks like it might only end up average at best, so while I still see so much upside at a still projectable 6'3'', 190 pounds, I can't rank him any higher than this. 2025 Projection: 29/6/26/.229/.292/.371/11 Prime Projection: 78/18/68/.248/.319/.418/25

84) Rhett Lowder - CIN, RHP, 23.1 - Lowder was known as a high floor, low ceiling, fast moving college pitcher in his draft year, and that is exactly what he gave us in 2024. He put up a 3.64 ERA with a 25.3/5.4 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at mostly Double-A, and then he got the call to the bigs and held his own with a 1.17 ERA (4.25 xERA) with a 17.2/10.9 K%/BB% in 30.2 IP. I trust the K/BB and xERA more than the ERA, but even with the underlying numbers being lackluster, there were other positive takeaways from the debut. Namely his 93.5 MPH fastball put up a very good 27.8% whiff%. Plus control of a good fastball is a very strong foundation, and Lowder is more than just that with a legit 4 pitch mix. The slider and changeup were less impressive in the majors, and he wasn't putting up big strikeout numbers in the minors, so development of those secondaries will be huge to unlock more upside. As is, he projects as a solid mid rotation starter, but there is definitely upside for more. - 2025 Projection: 5/4.11/1.31/106 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.72/1.16/177 in 175 IP

85) Zebby Matthews - MIN, RHP, 24.10 - Zebby had a mixed bag MLB debut, and I think it leaned more bad than good. The good part is that the 24.3/6.2 K%/BB% and 4.05 xFIP looks really solid. K/BB is King for pitchers, so that alone tells me that I think Zebby will be fine. But I have some concerns, and those concerns are that his heavily used 94.9 MPH fastball wasn't nearly as good in the majors as it was the minors, and that his stuff got hit really damn hard in both the majors and Triple-A, leading to a 6.69 ERA in 37.2 MLB IP, and a 5.68 ERA in 19 AAA IP. His fastball put up a 94.3 MPH EV against in the majors and a 93 MPH EV against at Triple-A. His 2nd most used pitch, the slider, also got hit really hard at both stops with a 90.2 MPH EV against in the majors and a 94.7 MPH EV against at Triple-A. He had a 14% Barrel% against in the majors, which is wildly bad. His slider and changeup both missed bats, we know how good his control is with a ridiculous 7 walks in 97 IP in the minors, and this was just his first taste of the majors after starting the season at High-A. He definitely deserves some grace to have an adjustment period, especially because he was reaching a career high in IP, and the strong K/BB rate gives added confidence that he will figure it out. It's just that I feel his reasonable upside projection drops from maybe a #2 to a #3. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.26/1.31/121 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.77/1.24/180 in 170 IP

86) Moises Chace - PHI, RHP, 21.10 - Chace has one of those beautiful double plus fastballs that is just a wonder to watch. It visually looks like it's swimming through the air, picking up speed before it blows by some poor minor league hitter. Saying it's explosive would be an understatement. It's been racking up strikeouts in the lower minors since 2021, and then he got his first shot at the upper minors to close out 2024, and he shined with a 3.66 ERA and 45.5/9.1 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP over 4 outings. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus slider and solid changeup. The one thing that can tank him is his control as he put up a 12% BB% in 80.1 IP on the season, and it's been even worse than that in the past. It definitely might end up being the fatal flaw which puts him in the bullpen, and it prevents me from really going too crazy here, because I do love the stuff. Even with that risk, he's an excellent upside pitching prospect who should come at a very reasonable price. This isn't a comp, but think something like what DJ Herz did this year. I'm going after him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.81/1.27/168 in 150 IP

87) Brock Wilken - MIL, 3B, 22.10 - Wilken is a 6'4'', 225 pound masher who has the 3B job wide open for him right now with Willy Adames hitting free agency, likely moving Joey Ortiz to SS (or Turang to SS and Ortiz to 2B). There definitely seems to be a path to playing time, and there is little doubt that he will hit dingers and get on base when he gets that chance with 17 homers and a 13.4% BB% in 108 games at Double-A. The hit tool was worse than we hoped for with a .199 BA and 28.2% K%, but some of that was definitely bad BABIP luck. He was also hit in the face with a pitch on April 11th, sustaining multiple facial fractures, so I think we can cut him some extra slack for that, although he performed better the first 3 months after returning than he did in August and September, so maybe that is just an excuse. Either way, I'm betting on the monster power, pedigree (18th pick in the 2023 MLB Draft) and opportunity. - 2025 Projection: 27/11/36/.219/.296/.427/1 Prime Projection:  75/28/86/.238/.320/.476/2

88) Ralphy Velazquez - CLE, 1B, 19.10 - Velazquez was one of my top FYPD targets last off-season, ranking him 21st overall, and he more than delivered with a big season at Single-A. He cracked 10 homers with a 20.1/15.0 K%/BB% and 131 wRC+ in 82 games. He struggled when he got to High-A with a 54 wRC+ in 19 games, but considering he started the year as an 18 year old, that isn't a big deal. Cleveland moved him off catcher to 1B, which isn't surprising and is a good thing for fantasy. One of the reasons I loved him so much last off-season was because when a smart team takes a 1B prospect so high (23rd overall), you know they absolutely love the bat, and at 6'3'', 215 pounds with a smooth and powerful lefty swing, it's hard not to love his bat. He profiles as a classic middle of the order slugger. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/30/92/.258/.345/.500/6

89) Cole Young - SEA, 2B/SS, 21.8 - Young put up a 119 wRC+ in 124 games at Double-A as a 20/21 year old, which is impressive, but he did it on the back of an elite 15.8/12.1 K%/BB%, making him a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect. He hit only 9 homers, there isn't big raw power in here, and he's not a guy looking to hit dingers with a low launch, all fields approach, so he doesn't project for big power either. The biggest blow to his fantasy value is that he isn't a good base stealer, going 23 for 34, and he's not a true burner, so his upside on the bases is questionable too. I don't think we should underrate the fact that he was 20 years old at Double-A, and that includes the power/speed numbers, so I don't want to to be overly harsh, but he remains a better real life than fantasy prospect, which has been the book on him since being drafted. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/17/62/.278/.349/.426/18

90) Michael Arroyo - SEA, 2B, 20.5 - Arroyo always had precocious plate skills, writing in his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "He looks like a seasoned vet at the dish, and is the type who jumps out immediately when you watch him hit. He’s completely locked in and makes hitting a baseball look easy." But I questioned his power upside at only 5'8'', and in 2024, he answered those power questions in a resounding fashion. He clubbed 23 homers in 120 games split between Single-A and High-A, and he did it while remaining a good all around hitter, slashing .285/.400/.509 with a 23.0/12.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, and he can hit the ball hard. His swing looks damn quick to me too. He's not a burner, but he can run a little bit too with 18 steals. There certainly seems to be some little man discount going on here, because Arroyo has a lot to be excited about. He's easily a Top 100 dynasty prospect, and if he were 6'2'', we might be talking about him in an entirely different way. The biggest issue is that Seattle will be his home ballpark, and without huge raw power, it's going to limit his upside. That is why I would hesitate to stick your neck out too much, but I still like him a lot. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/77/.268/.347/.445/14

91) Ricky Tiedemann - TOR, LHP, 22.8 - Tiedemann underwent Tommy John surgery in late July which will likely wipeout his entire 2025 season. It's definitely a blow to his value, but honestly, with a young flamethrower like this, it should be completely expected. If you jump ship on every flamethrowing pitching prospect you own after undergoing major elbow surgery, you might as well not even draft them (which is a completely viable strategy, although I don't mind taking a shot on one or two). I already used Tiedemann as a trade piece last season in my 12 teamer, as even when I do own them, I don't hesitate to use them in win now deals. That deal netted me 2 years of Will Smith, who helped me secure 3rd place and my money back. Such a fitting lukewarm finish for the lukewarm fantasy player Smith has become. But back to Tiedemann, assuming full health, he has the potential for a plus to double plus fastball/slider combo, to go along with a pretty damn good changeup too. The control/command is below average, so along with the injury, there is certainly a lot of risk in the profile at the moment. Hopefully he can get back on the mound at the end of the season, or even in the AFL, to show the huge stuff is back and to get the hype going into the off-season. He's definitely still a Top 100 Prospect for me, and even that might be selling him too low. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection:  13/3.53/1.21/185 in 165 IP

92) Tommy Troy - ARI, 2B/SS, 23.3 - Troy saved his season at the end of the year, because it looked like his dynasty value was in a nose dive before slashing .276/.375/.447 with 4 homers, 9 steals, and a 22.2/11.8 K/BB% in his last 32 games at High-A. He then went to the AFL and kept on hitting with a .864 OPS in 22 games. A hamstring injury knocked out 2 months of his season early in the year, and it seemed like he just couldn't find a rhythm when he returned, so there is something to point to for the slow start. The skills and general explosiveness of his game that got him drafted 12th overall are all still there. His hype definitely dropped this year, but I would be careful about selling too low here. He's still a Top 100 prospect for me. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/18/71/.251/.320/.427/23

93) Arjun Nimmala - TOR, SS, 19.6 - Nimmala got off to a slow start in full season ball, which is completely understandable considering he was only 18 years old, but once he found his footing, he showed why he was one of the most hyped high school bats in his class. He slashed .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers, 5 steals, and a 29.7/6.4 K%/BB% in his last 53 games. He has one of the sweetest righty swings in the game that is tailored made to launch the ball to the moon with a 46.6% FB%. It's powerful too with a 89.1 MPH EV, and at a projectable 6'1'', there is only more power coming. He's also a good athlete who should contribute in steals even if he isn't a huge base stealer. The biggest issue is clearly the hit tool, but you have to give him some leeway for his age, and the upside is high enough to take on that extra risk. I have Nimmala grouped with Brandon Winokur and Eric Bitonti as tooled up power hitting beasts with hit tool risk in the back half of the Top 100 Prospects Rankings. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/28/89/.242/.321/.473/14

94) Dylan Beavers - BAL, OF, 23.7 - Beavers doesn't have a clear path to a full time job right now, but there are bench jobs available for Beavers to force his way into the lineup at some point during 2025, and we all know injuries/trades happen. He can play all 3 OF spots and is a pretty good defensive player. There is a reason Baltimore didn't use him as trade bait (yet). I think they like him a lot. There is going to be opportunity eventually, and he has the type of fantasy friendly skillset to go after. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 206 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that hits the ball hard and hits the ball in the air (15 homers with a 49.1% FB% in 119 games at Double-A). He's also fast with 31 steals. The hit tool isn't great with a .241 BA and 22.6/13.2 K%/BB%, but the high walk rates mitigate some of that, and he has the type of power/speed combo to survive a low BA. Beavers looks like a very enticing, not hyped to death fantasy target right now. - 2025 Projection: 17/5/21/.228/.297/.391/5 Prime Projection: 81/20/75/.247/.326/.430/24

95) Brandon Winokur - MIN, SS/OF, 20.5 - Winokur is one of my favorite prospect targets right now relative to perceived value. 6'6'', 210 pound athletes like this don't grow on trees, and I think he deserves to rise to true unicorn status. His big time power is obvious, and it resulted in 14 homers with a 89.6 MPH EV in 94 games at Single-A. The area of his game that gets considerably underrated, is how good of an athlete he is. He put up plus run times in high school, and then he went out and stole 23 bags in 29 attempts this year. He played both SS and CF this year. This is not some lumbering corner bat. This is a unicorn with real defensive value. The problem, of course, is the hit tool. He put up a 28.0/8.3 K%/BB% and he swings and misses a lot. There is no denying there is very real risk here, but that is why he isn't like a Top 50 prospect. As is, I believe he is a top 100 fantasy prospect, and he won't be valued anywhere close to that in off-season prospect drafts. He's a major target. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/26/83/.246/.317/.471/15

96) Eric Bitonti - MIL, 3B, 19.5 - In my End of Season Mailbag Podcast (Patreon), I ran down a list of several of my favorite underrated and/or reasonably priced prospect targets to go after, and Bitonti easily cracked that list. He has future elite power hitting prospect written all over him at 6'4'', 218 pounds with a powerful, athletic and sweet lefty swing that is made to hit bombs. He smoked 8 homers with a 157 wRC+ in 51 games at the age appropriate stateside rookie ball, and then he got called up to Single-A and went nuclear with 8 homers in just 28 games. With his raw power and an over 50% FB%, he can't not hit homers. He also gets on base a ton with a 16.5% BB%, which offsets some of the swing and miss issues (27.9% K%). And he's a good athlete with 12 steals in 15 attempts over 79 games, so he should contribute at least a handful in that category. Definitely go after him everywhere. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/33/97/.242/.331/.497/8

97) Aidan Smith - TBR, OF, 20.8 - The Rays targeted Smith in the Randy Arozarena trade (along with Brody Hopkins), which is good news for Smith, because he goes from a ballpark that is terrible for his profile, to one that is perfect for him (assuming Tampa goes back to the Trop in future years). Isaac Paredes proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the righty lift and pull profile can thrive in Tampa, and that is Smith's game with a 35.7% GB% and 54.4% Pull% (11 homers in 97 games at Single-A). He combines that with projectable power at 6'2'', 190 pounds, plus speed with 41 steals in 47 attempts, and a strong plate approach with a 23.2/14.4 K%/BB%. The hit tool is still on the risky side, but if he gains meaningful raw power as he enters his 20's, he has true explosion potential. He's really exciting. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/76/.250/.338/.443/25

98) Cooper Pratt - MIL, SS, 20.8 - The only thing Pratt didn't do at Single-A was hit for power, hitting only 3 homers with a 25% FB% in 73 games, but when he got the call to High-A, he immediately proved that he wasn't going to have any problems getting to his potentially plus power with 5 homers and a 38.7% FB% in just 23 games. At a projectable 6'4'', there is no doubt the raw juice is in there, and he also proved to be an excellent athlete (27 steals) with a strong plate approach (20.0/10.3 K%/BB%). The plate approach was much better at Single-A than High-A, and some of that was certainly because he was trying to get to more of his power. So he's not a finished product, but the ingredients are in here to be an impact across the board fantasy player. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/23/80/.262/.328/.453/18

99) Kyle Teel - CHW, C, 23.2 - Teel was known as a high floor, lower ceiling, quick moving college catcher in last year's FYPD, and that is exactly what he did in 2024. He slashed .288/.386/.433 with 13 homers, 12 steals, and a 23.0/13.5 K%/BB% in 112 games split between Double-A (145 wRC+) and Triple-A (97 wRC+). His 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A isn't super impressive, but he knows how to lift and pull it, so he should get the most out of his raw power. He's also a good athlete who likes to run relative to other catchers, so that can help his fantasy value even if the homer totals aren't huge. He had a crystal clear path to Boston's starting catcher job of the future (and the present), but with his trade to Chicago, he now has to battle it out with Edgar Quero. You have to think Teel is the favorite for most of the at bats, but that might be a bad assumption, and at the end of the day, that will get decided on the field. The trade probably doesn't change Teel's dynasty value too much in the grand scheme of things, but it's a ballpark hit, organization hit, and a bit of a path to playing time hit. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/34/.244/.311/.383/4 Prime Projection: 74/17/68/.268/.342/.430/9

100) Robert Calaz - COL, OF, 19.5 - The 6'2'', 202 pound Calaz is a straight power hitting beast. He cracked 7 homers in 43 games in the DSL in 2023, he smoked 10 homers in 49 games in stateside rookie in 2024, and then he chipped in 2 homers in 13 games at Single-A to close out the season. He crushes the ball with plus to double plus raw power, and his batted ball profile is conducive to both power and average. He slashed .327/.386/.571 at Single-A as an 18 year old, and has a career .336/.436/.603 triple-slash in 105 career games. He's done nothing but obliterate every level of pro ball that's been put in front of him. He doesn't exactly have my favorite batting stance, but the swing is quick and powerful, and I'm not going to get too caught up in that. The biggest risk is the contact rates, as the strikeout rate has been high at every level (career 23.4% K%, which is quite high for rookie ball levels), culminating with a 28.1% K% at Single-A. We have to trust Colorado to develop him, which isn't great, and then we have to trust Colorado to actually play him and give him leash, which also isn't great. Combined with the hit tool risk, it prevents me from going higher than this, but he has one of the top 19 year old power bats in the minors. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/28/88/.247/.324/.471/7

101) Joendry Vargas - LAD, SS, 19.5 - Vargas was one of my favorite targets in his international class, and then was once again one of my favorite DSL breakout targets, so if anyone wants to crown him already, it would be me, but I can't quite crown him yet. He had a strong year in stateside rookie ball with a 129 wRC+, but 4 homers in 38 games shows the game power isn't quite there yet, the 22.8% K% is on the high side, and he wasn't that successful on the bases, going 11 for 16. So that means he still needs to improve his hit tool, power, and speed. Completely reasonable for an 18 year old rookie baller to need to improve basically everywhere, and I still love the power upside at a projectable 6'4'' with hard hit ability, but it's not quite that straight rocket ship you really want. He's a Top 100 prospect for me, but I can't put him in that truly coveted tier quite yet. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 81/25/85/.257/.336/.465/8

102) Eduardo Quintero – LAD, OF, 19.7 – Quintero was one of, if not the top DSL breakout in 2023, and he mostly backed it up in stateside rookie ball in 2024, slashing .330/.459/.449 with 3 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.3/17.6 K%/BB% in 56 games. It was good for a 142 wRC+. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 77 wRC+ in 27 games, but it came with a 19.6/16.1 K%/BB%, so it’s not like he was completely overmatched or anything. You have to give these kids time to adjust to a new level. He’s an excellent athlete at 6’0”, 175 pounds with plus speed, hard hit ability, a good feel to hit, and a plus plate approach. The launch is geared for both power and average, and he has a good glove in the OF. This guy basically does everything well on a baseball field, and while there is still plenty of development left to go (being more aggressive at the dish, getting stronger, unlocking more game power, proving it at higher levels), you have to trust the Dodgers to get the most out of him. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 86/19/74/.273/.341/.430/26

103) Bryce Rainer - DET, SS, 19.9 - Selected 11th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Rainer is your classic "looks the part" prospect at 6'3'', 195 pounds with a smooth lefty swing, plus power potential, plus athleticism, and a good glove at SS. Corey Seager and Kyle Tucker would be the absolute ceiling comps, while Colson Montgomery would be a more recent comp. Like Montgomery, Rainer is older for his class at 19 years old already, and his hit tool isn't a slam dunk either quite yet. Come to think of it, Riley Greene might actually be the perfect comp here, and Detroit has done a great job developing Greene. Detroit got their SS version of Greene (although Greene was a slightly more touted prospect in his draft year, so he would be close to a ceiling comp as well). - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.263/.336/.465/12

104) Braylon Payne - MIL, OF, 18.8 - When a smart franchise sticks their neck out and selects a high school bat higher than expected, you should take notice. I took notice when it happened with Xavier Isaac and Tampa, and then Ralphy Velazquez with Cleveland. I ranked both very high and named them targets. And now I'm going to do the same with Payne after the Brewers selected him 17th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft. The book on the 6'2'', 186 pound Payne coming into the draft was that he had big time talent and upside, but was still on the raw side. Which is why it was so exciting to see his electric pro debut where he slashed .438/.526/.625 with 0 homers, 4 steals, and a 15.8/15.8 K%/BB% in 4 games at Single-A. It's only 4 games, and the swing isn't geared towards power right now, but there is definitely raw power in there with a 110 MPH shot already to his name, and he has game breaking speed. He's also young for the class and will be 18 years old for most of 2025. Payne is the type of target you stick your neck out for in off-season prospect drafts, and after the consensus Top group is off the board, Payne is my next target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/18/63/.267/.334/.436/38

105) Theo Gillen - TBR, SS, 19.7 - Selected 18th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Gillen has near elite dynasty upside at 6'3'', 200 pounds with electric bat speed, potentially plus power, plus speed, and a good feel to hit. He still needs to learn how to fully tap into his raw power, and he underwent shoulder surgery from a torn labrum in 2022, so he's not a finished product, and he's not without risk. His pro debut underscored that with a  41.2% K%, .154 BA, and 86 wRC+ in 8 games at Single-A, but the 23.5% BB% mitigates that K rate a bit, it was only 8 games, and in the past, high schoolers debuted in rookie ball. Now they are thrown right into the fire in full season ball. I would give a lot of leeway for all of these high school bats, but I gotta be honest, the 41.2% K% is sticking in my craw right now. You can try to project the hit tool of these high school hitters all you want, but you really don't know if they will be able to hit pro pitching until they get there. I'm not panicking at all over the super small sample, and I still like him a ton, but I do think that extremely high K rate could be a harbinger of things to come. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/20/76/.252/.331/.441/20

106) Hye-seong Kim - LAD, 2B, 26.2 - It's funny that I just had Kim and Lux ranked back to back in the 2B rankings, with Kim one spot ahead, and it looks like the Dodgers agreed with me. They preferred Kim to Lux at 2B too after they signed Kim and shipped out Lux to Cincinnati. Kim signed a 3 year, $12.5 million contract with the Dodgers, but he got better offers elsewhere. Smart move going to the best situation rather than taking the best offer. Kim's contact/speed/defense profile is one that plenty of starting 2B have, and I think it will play in the majors. He slashed .326/.383/.458 with 11 homers, 30 steals, and a 10.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 127 games in the KBO. We can look at Jung Hoo Lee as a comp who just came over last year. Both are lefties and the same age with similar profiles. Lee is 2 inches taller, had much better contact rates, much better walk rates, and much better power numbers. He didn't run nearly as much though, and steals are a huge part of fantasy, so that is a nice edge to Kim. Kim isn't as good as Lee overall, but Lee's skills more or less transferred to the bigs, so I don't see why Kim's couldn't too. Just check out this homer he hit in 2023. I would say that swing could play. It seems like he has a full time job at the moment (although nothing is certain until the off-season is over), and as I wrote in the 2B rankings, if he ended up with a full time job, I'm apt to go after him. Even better that he ended up with one on the Dodgers - 2025 Projection: 71/9/53/.260/.307/.372/22 Prime Projection: 77/10/61/.273/.321/.398/26

107) Sean Burke - CHW, RHP, 25.3 - Here is what I wrote about Burke right after his first start in the majojrs: "I’m far from ready to call Burke a target, but I will say that there are some interesting things brewing here that deserve our attention. He had his 2nd strong MLB outing in a row, going 5 IP with 5 hits, 2 ER, and a 5/2 K/BB vs. Oakland. The fastball sat 95.4 MPH and put up a 29% whiff%, while the slider and curve were solid as well with a 33% and 30% whiff%. It led to a 31% whiff% overall. His first outing against Cleveland was more of the same, and he now has a 2.25 ERA with a 30.4% whiff% in 8 IP. He has size (6’6”, 230 pounds), velocity (mid 90’s heat that misses bats) and bat missing secondaries (slider, curve change). He didn’t perform well at Triple-A with a 4.62 ERA in 64.1 IP, but all 4 of his pitches missed a ton of bats leading to a 31% K%. Control is the biggest problem here with well below average walk rates his entire career, but super tall pitchers can sometimes take longer to make control gains, and we all know that pitching development isn’t linear. So far in the majors he has a 8.3% BB%. Again, I’m not calling him a target, but I am saying there is some very interesting stuff going on here. There are definitely ingredients for a big breakout in the future, and as a free pick up in the vast majority of leagues, I don’t hate it all. Consider this your first little warning on Burke." ... and after that outing, Burke dominated in 2 more starts with 1 ER and a 14/4 K/BB in 11 IP. If he was able to do it in a larger sample, he might have been valued more closely with Spencer Arrighetti (both have similar-ish profiles), and I'm apt to use the small sample to my advantage. The skills are there are to be a high K mid-rotation starter, and he did prove it on the MLB level. He's an excellent later round target. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.96/1.31/149 in 140 IP

108) Caden Dana - LAA, RHP, 21.4 - The Angels fast tracked the talented Dana through their farm system, because of course they did, and once again, it mostly paid off for them. With the right players, they are proving the strategy can definitely work. Dana spent the entire season at Double-A as a 20 year old and excelled with a 2.52 ERA and 27.4/7.3 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP. He then got a taste of the majors and struggled with a 9.58 ERA and 15.4/13.5 K%/BB% in 10.1 IP, but that is basically meaningless. He racked up an impressive amount of innings for a 20 year old, and that was at the end of a very long season. He most certainly looks the part at a rock solid 6'4'', 210 pounds. The fastball sat 93.7 MPH and it gets good movement with bat missing ability. There could also be another tick or 2 coming down the line. The slider is nasty and even in his rough MLB debut it performed well with a 37.5% whiff%. The lesser used changeup, curve and cutter all performed really well too with a 37.5%, 50%, and 66.7% whiff%, respectively. He has about average command of the entire arsenal. He showed off mid rotation upside in 2024, and that was as a 20 year old in the upper minors and the majors. If he can take a step forward this off-season with his arsenal and command, there could be yet another level in here. - 2025 Projection: 4/4.27/1.34/87 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.73/1.20/194 in 180 IP

109) Jacob Wilson - OAK, SS, 23.0 - Wilson stole just 2 bases in 3 attempts in 53 minor league games, and then he didn't attempt a single steal in 28 games in his MLB debut. That is just brutal for his type of profile, and with a below average sprint speed, it doesn't seem like there is much hope for him to really be a major contributor in steals. And without that, there is just no upside in this profile at all with legitimately bottom of the scale power. He had a 84 MPH EV with a 2% Barrel% at Triple-A, and a 85.4 MPH EV with 0 barrels in the majors. He's a relatively thin and projectable 6'3'', so I definitely don't think it's impossible for him to gain power in his mid to late 20's, but that is an extremely low point to start from. Of course what you are buying is the truly elite contact rates with a minuscule 4.3% K% at Triple-A and a 9.7% K% in the majors, but even with that, he's going to need to hit the ball harder to truly take full advantage of that. This just isn't the type of profile I go after in fantasy, but in deep leagues where safety gets a bump, I could see going higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 73/5/42/.273/.328/.381/7 Prime Projection: 88/10/50/.291/.356/.405/10

110) Ryan Bliss - SEA, 2B/SS, 25.4 - Maybe I got a little too overexcited about Bliss when I named him a major target mid-season, but I still love his potential fantasy impact relative to his super, super subdued hype, and at the moment, there is a clear path to the 2B job (which of course could change in an instant). The main selling point is the stolen base upside with him stealing 50 bags in 93 bags at Triple-A. But what makes him so exciting, is that he is not just a light hitting speedster. He can actually hit the ball pretty damn hard, and he showed that in his MLB debut with a 88.5/98.2 MPH AVG/FB EV. The EV was strong at Triple-A too with an 88.8 MPH EV. He's not a huge lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull enough to rip some dingers (12 in 93 games at AAA), and especially in Seattle's ballpark, we don't want him to lift and pull. Hitting the ball hard all over the field works perfectly for his profile. He's also a good 2B. The biggest issue is that the hit tool is not quite optimal for this type of profile. He put up a 22.4% K% at AAA and a 31% K% in the majors. The plate approach is good with a 14.1% BB% at AAA and an excellent 21% Chase% in the majors, which mitigates the hit tool somewhat, but not all the way. That is the thing holding me back from going too crazy, but Bliss could be free to very cheap in most leagues, and why not take a shot. - 2025 Projection: 61/13/52/.237/.304/.380/23 Prime Projection: 77/17/66/.254/.325/.416/31

111) Agustin Ramirez - MIA, C, 23.7 - Ramirez was the crown jewel of the Jazz Chisholm trade, so there is no way that Miami makes this deal if they don't have every intention of giving him a real shot, and with the catcher job wide open, it seems very possible that he breaks camp as the starting catcher (and also mixing in at some 1B and DH). He profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher with 25 homers and a .267 BA in 25 games in the upper minors. The 18.6/11.1 K%/BB% shows the plate skills are also pretty good, making him relatively low risk. The risk comes from the fact that he isn't a particularly good defensive catcher, so it's possible the bat will have to hit well enough to profile at 1B/DH as well. He also has former first round Joe Mack and his 2024 breakout right behind him, so there is definitely going to be some competition for that job in the near future. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/36/.238/.309/.418/2 Prime Projection: 58/19/69/.251/.328/.439/5

112) Braxton Ashcraft - PIT, RHP, 25.6 - I love Ashcraft when healthy, but his elbow health is a major question mark headed into the off-season with bright red warning signs flashing. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2022, and when he returned in 2023, his stuff looked electric in 52.2 IP. He again looked electric in the first half of 2024 with a 2.84 ERA and 25.8/4.0 K%/BB% in 73 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. But the elbow problems returned after his July 6th start, hitting the IL until August 30th. His stuff was way down in that one outing and then he hit the IL again with "a recurrent right forearm injury." As much as I love the mid to upper 90's fastball, the plus to double plus slider, plus control, size (6'5''), and pitch mix (he also throws a good changeup and curve), I can't ignore the very major injury risk. It could end up landing him in the bullpen eventually, or very early into 2025 if he has problems ramping up. If I were to ignore the injury risk, I can see ranking him much higher than this, so this placement factors in a healthy dose of risk. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.10/1.28/45 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/3.72/1.17/130 in 130 IP

113) Drake Baldwin - ATL, C, 24.1 - Baldwin has a path to playing time problem with Sean Murphy under contract through 2028 at least, and I don't see why Atlanta would be motivated to trade either one of them (although it's certainly possible). Both of their bats are good enough to get some DH at bats, so I think both could theoretically survive even without a trade, but it cuts majorly into the projected playing time for them over the next several years. It's a shame for fantasy, because Baldwin is proving to have one of the most exciting prospect catcher bats in the game. He destroyed Triple-A with 12 homers, a 92.8 MPH EV, a 16.2/15.6 K%/BB% and 135 wRC+ in 72 games. He has the power, contact and plate approach to be a Top 5 fantasy catcher at peak, but along with Sean Murphy, there are a few things keeping me from going too crazy. His 96 wRC+ in 52 games at Double-A was not as good as his Triple-A run. His 7.7 degree launch isn't great and his groundball rates have been pretty high in the upper minors. His hit tool is also projected to be closer to average at best, rather than a truly impact tool. You don't need to be all that great to be one of the top hitting catchers in baseball, but tack on Sean Murphy to all of that, and he lands more as a Top 100 prospect for me rather than one I'm really targeting. 2025 Projection: 18/5/22/.238/.307/.399/1  Prime Projection: 64/20/78/.260/.335/.438/1

114) Jhostynxon Garcia - BOS, OF, 22.3 - Garcia is one of my top prospect targets relative to perceived value, and he was one of several prospect targets I named in my End of Season Mailbag Podcast (Patreon). He has legit thunder in his bat with a quick and powerful righty swing that resulted in 23 homers in 107 games. He hits the ball really hard and he lifts it with all fields power. He's also a good athlete who can play CF, and he'll run a bit too with 17 steals. He started the year at Single-A and flew all the way through to Double-A by mid August. He wasn't quite as good at Double-A as he was in the lower minors, but he still put up an above average 103 wRC+, and the most important thing is that his K rate didn't skyrocket with a 19% K%. The hit tool and plate approach are certainly the biggest risk here with a 21.6/7.2 K%/BB% overall, but the K rate actually got better at each higher level, and he walked a ton in 2021-23, so he has that skill in there. His combination of power, athleticism and good OF defense is very enticing, and the hit tool was actually pretty decent this year. Boston is crowded, so he doesn't have a path to playing time, but trades happen and injuries/ineffectiveness happens too, so he'll get his shot eventually, and when he does, we could be looking at a guy who puts up big EV's with a high launch, above average sprint, positive defense value, and good enough K rates. He can be a legit impact fantasy bat going for a price way under that right now. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/25/84/.247/.321/.458/12
