Pitchers

Nick Lodolo - CIN, LHP, 27.2 - The Eternal Buy Low is back at it again. It wouldn't be a dynasty baseball off-season without Nick Lodolo being a buy low candidate. I imagine that one day I will be in my 80's, and I will be writing about how Nick Lodolo Jr. is a great buy low candidate. Like father, like son (or maybe like grandfather, like grandson at that point). But back to this present timeline, it really is the same old story, different details. Lodolo missed time this year with a groin injury and finger injury, but neither are to his arm, so it's not as concerning long term even if these non arm injuries are starting to pile up. He also underperformed his underlying numbers with a 4.76 ERA vs. 3.78 xERA in 115.1 IP. The K% dropped a bit this year with a 24.7/7.5 K%/BB%, but the stuff is still excellent, so I'm also not overly concerned with that. He has a 94.1 MPH fastball that put up a respectable .323 xwOBA and 23% whiff%. The curveball is plus to double plus with a .233 xwOBA and 42.5% whiff%. He also throws a decent changeup and sinker, giving him a legit 4 pitch mix. The control is average or maybe even above. It's been a frustrating start to his career because we all know there is so much more in here, but I'm not letting that frustration get to me. Certainly do not sell low on this man, and once again, target him. 2025 Projection: 10/3.73/1.22/166 in 150 IP

Hunter Greene - CIN, RHP, 25.8 - Here is what I wrote in part in Greene's 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "Buy low on Hunter Greene. We’ve been taught over and over again to not throw the towel in on elite pitching prospects if they don’t immediately dominate their first few years in the league, and Greene has all of the ingredients to be a next level breakout as he gains more experience. I know the fastball gets hit harder than you would expect, but as his command improves and as he continues to tinker with his arsenal, I’m betting on him figuring it out. This is going to be one of those breakouts that look so obvious in hindsight." ... and that obvious (in hindsight) breakout happened in 2024 with him putting up a 2.75 ERA (4.82 ERA in 2023), 3.03 xERA, and a 27.7/9.3 K%/BB% in 150.1 IP. He did in fact tinker with his arsenal (I wrote that blurb before news of his new pitches came out, but of course all young pitchers are now tinkering with their arsenals if they are smart), improving his fastball movement to the point where it was the 2nd most valuable fastball in baseball (Cade Smith is #1 by a landslide). He also added a splitter which was an above average pitch, even if he didn't go to it often (8.3% usage). And the slider of course remained a plus to double plus whiff machine (39% whiff%). His control/command remained below average, but I still think there is another level in here as he stays healthy and gains more experience. I don't even think this is the peak, assuming he stays healthy, which who knows there honestly (he missed time with elbow inflammation this year). Greene had the ace breakout I knew was coming, and I'm going to continue to buy high. 2025 Projection: 14/3.26/1.05/203 in 170 IP

Hitters

Spencer Steer - CIN, 1B/OF, 27.4 - Good luck trying to predict stolen bases. Steer was quite bad at stealing bases in the minors, and barely ran. He went 0 for 1 in his 28 game MLB debut in 2022. And then over the last two year he's become one of the better base stealers in the majors. He went 15 for 18 in 2023 and then 25 for 28 in 2024. His 28.2 ft/sec sprint speed is definitely plenty fast enough to steal bags if you are good at it, and it seems Steer has been putting in the work on that part of his game. It's a big deal for his fantasy value, because he already had a strong plate approach and above average game power. He had a 20.9%/11.0% K%/BB% with an 88 MPH EV, 17.4 degree launch, and a 44.4% Pull%. With the newfound stolen bases, that should make him a perennial .250/20+/20+ guy for the next several years. And if he can find just a hair more raw power in his late 20's, there could be a big career year or two mixed in there. Defense is his biggest problem as he isn't good anywhere on the field, but he has versatility (he can play every position but CF), and he's not terrible at any of them either. I'm not really concerned about his playing time at all. I've been high on Steer since his breakout in the upper minors in 2022, and I'll continue to be high on him. I would value him like a Top 75 dynasty asset at the least, and maybe more than a Top 50 one. 2025 Projection: 81/25/90/.253/.339/.456/21

Noelvi Marte - CIN, 3B, 23.6 - Marte got popped for an 80 game PED suspension in March, which shocked the prospect and baseball world. My first instinct isn't to just drop talented players down the rankings when they get popped for PED's, but when Marte returned mid-season, he did everything in his power to prove he was actually cheating. Everything got much worse from his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 46 wRC+ in 242 PA, which was the 6th worst mark in baseball (min 240 PA). Only Tim Anderson, Brandon Drury, Javier Baez, Dominic Fletcher and Eddie Rosario were worse. He got slower with his home plate to 1B runtime dropping from 4.3 to 4.43. His EV dropped from 91.3 MPH to 87 MPH. His Chase% jumped from 28.6% to 37.1%. His K% jumped from 20.3% to 31%. He was also terrible on defense, leading to a negative 1.5 WAR on the season. He was quite simply one of the very worst players in baseball. It's possible that the horrific season wasn't purely because he wasn't on the juice anymore. It's certainly possible that the suspension threw off his entire season both mentally and physically. An entire off-season to regroup should be a big help towards bouncing back in 2025. I'm not giving up on him at all, but I do think there has to be a major penalty for the possibility he was in fact cheating. I know everyone, including me, kinda brushes off the PED thing nowadays, but guys can still genuinely cheat, right? Marte drops from a Top 100 dynasty asset to more of a Top 200 one, and even that might be generous. 2025 Projection: 66/14/61/.240/.300/.403/19 Prime Projection: 82/21/76/.260/.326/.441/26

Matt McLain - CIN, 2B/SS, 25.8 - Don't forget about little Matty Mclain. He underwent shoulder surgery in late March and then suffered a late season rib injury which knocked out his entire regular season. But he returned in time for the AFL to prove his shoulder was healthy, and while he's not ripping up the level with a .758 OPS, he popped 2 dingers in 10 games. This is basically just him getting back on the field and easing into things, so the most important thing is that he's out there. It gives confidence that with a full normal off-season, he will be ready to build on his awesome 2023 MLB debut where he slashed .290/.357/.507 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in 89 games. He obliterated Triple-A too with a 184 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint and he has above average power with a 89.3 MPH EV and 13.8 degree launch. His plate approach wasn’t great with a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in the majors, but his chase rate was above average at 25.4%, and his 28% whiff% shows he isn’t going to have any major contact issues. He also had a 20.6%/16.7% K%/BB% in the minors. And the cherry on top is that he is a good defensive player, so his glove will keep him on the field. Assuming full health, McLain is the real deal, but factoring in some rust and/or risk from the surgery wouldn't be crazy. Just don't factor in too much, because McLain can be a really exciting fantasy player. He's a Top 100 dynasty asset at the very least. 2025 Projection: 82/25/79/.269/.343/.468/22

Cincinnati Reds 2025 Top 10 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Chase Burns - CIN, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 2nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, dynasty managers owe a huge debt of gratitude to Cincinnati for going Burns over Condon. It would have made me legitimately sad to see Burns going to the Rockies. I know Cincinnati is no cake walk for pitchers themselves, but they just have a small ballpark, they don't have different air. And we've seen plenty of pitchers have excellent seasons in Cincy (Castillo, Gray, Greene, Lodolo), so I wouldn't let this landing spot move you off Burns at all. He has legit ace upside at a strong 6'3'', 210 pounds with a double plus fastball that sits in the upper 90's and a double plus slider that put up elite whiff rates. It led to a 2.70 ERA with a ridiculous 48.8%/7.7% K%/BB% in 100 IP in the ACC. He's inevitably going to get compared to Skenes, and Skenes put up a 1.69 ERA with a 45.2%/4.3% K%/BB% in 122.2 IP in the SEC. Skenes was in the tougher conference (although Burns pitched well in the SEC in 2022-23 before transferring to the ACC) with a better ERA, better walk rate and more IP. Burns isn't as good as Skenes, but not many pitchers are better than Skenes, so that isn't much of a knock. Burns also throws a curve and changeup to give him a legit starters pitch mix, and how well he can develop those pitches could dictate whether he becomes a true ace or a high K, #2/3 type. If your dynasty team is stacked with hitting, I don't think taking Burns #1 overall should be ruled out. The teams that took Skenes over Langford and Crews in 2024 aren't complaining too much right now. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.73/1.20/87 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.23/1.08/237 in 190 IP

2) Rhett Lowder - CIN, RHP, 23.1 - Lowder was known as a high floor, low ceiling, fast moving college pitcher in his draft year, and that is exactly what he gave us in 2024. He put up a 3.64 ERA with a 25.3/5.4 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at mostly Double-A, and then he got the call to the bigs and held his own with a 1.17 ERA (4.25 xERA) with a 17.2/10.9 K%/BB% in 30.2 IP. I trust the K/BB and xERA more than the ERA, but even with the underlying numbers being lackluster, there were other positive takeaways from the debut. Namely his 93.5 MPH fastball put up a very good 27.8% whiff%. Plus control of a good fastball is a very strong foundation, and Lowder is more than just that with a legit 4 pitch mix. The slider and changeup were less impressive in the majors, and he wasn't putting up big strikeout numbers in the minors, so development of those secondaries will be huge to unlock more upside. As is, he projects as a solid mid rotation starter, but there is definitely upside for more. 2025 Projection: 8/4.11/1.31/133 in 150 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.72/1.16/177 in 175 IP

3) Cam Collier - CIN, 3B, 20.4 - Collier might be the most underrated power hitting prospect in the minors. He's a big physical guy at 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful and quick lefty swing that is made to do damage, so he most certainly looks the part. It's what got him drafted 18th overall. And now he has the production part too with a blow up season at High-A as a 19 year old. He smashed 20 homers with a 25.0/13.0 K%/BB% and 129 wRC+ in 119 games. He crushes the ball and the power is at least plus. Age to level production, EV, pedigree, approach, eye test, great eventual home ballpark ... Collier has a ton of things going for him, and he really gets barely any hype. There is definitely hit tool risk, but that often comes with the package for young power hitters. Don't underrate Collier. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/29/93/.252/.333/.486/5

4) Alfredo Duno - CIN, C, 19.3 - Duno skipped right over stateside rookie ball and opened the season at Single-A, which tells you how much Cincinnati loved this kid. And really everyone loved this kid as a hyped up international signing who destroyed the DSL and most certainly looks the part at 6'2'', 210 pounds. Not only did he hold his own at the level, but he thrived with a 127 wRC+, 10.5% Barrel%, 89 MPH EV, and a 19 degree launch. He only hit 3 homers in 32 games, but that clearly isn't indicative of his true talent level. And he only played in 32 games because his season ended in late May with a broken rib. There is hit tool risk with a 28.8% K%, but considering how young he was the level, I'm not overly concerned with that. He's an elite power hitting catcher prospect waiting to happen, and he has the type of true upside to go after this off-season. I've been calling him a target since his signing year, and now is certainly the time to strike even in shallower leagues. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/28/82/.251/.338/.487/5

5) Edwin Arroyo - CIN, SS, 21.7 - Arroyo underwent shoulder surgery in late March and missed all of 2024, but he made it back for the AFL, so he should be able to have a completely normal off-season and be 100% healthy for 2025. Granted, he's not hitting very well in the AFL with a .651 OPS in 14 games, but he's 2.2 years younger than average, and this is basically his spring training coming off a major surgery. I would only take it as a positive that he is even playing in the league. He’s a switch hitter who hits well from both sides of the plate, he has plus speed, and at a pretty skinny 5'11”, there is definitely room for him to add more power. The hit tool and approach aren't quite good enough to get really excited for this type of profile, but if he can add real power, there is definitely potential for him to put up some super impactful fantasy seasons hitting in Cincinnati. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/17/64/.253/.320/.426/25

6) Sal Stewart - CIN, 2B/3B, 21.4 - If you like a plus plate approach, Stewart is your man. He put up a 16.9/14.8 K%/BB% in 80 games at High-A which led to a 144 wRC+. It's basically the same thing he did in 2023 and 2022. But he's not just a plus plate approach, he also has very real raw power. Just watch him crush this dinger 454 feet out to centerfield. This is a big physical guy in the box who can certainly unleash more game power if he tries. He hit only 8 homers this year and he likes to spray liners all over the field, so he would definitely have to change his hitting approach to do it, which may or may not work. He might just be content to plate approach his way through the minors. I don't love betting on plate approach guys who don't have much speed and aren't particularly good defensive players, but if he does unlock more game power, he could end up having a very potent hit/power combo at peak. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/21/76/.274/.350/.452/9

7) Tyson Lewis - CIN, SS, 19.3 -  Selected 51st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'2'', 195 pound Lewis is a high upside high school bat with at least plus speed, plus power potential, and a quick and powerful lefty swing. He's not the most refined high school bat, just recently undergoing a swing overhaul, and there are also some hit tool questions as he faces more advanced pitching. On pure upside, he rivals or surpasses Theo Gillen, but his bat isn't as safe and he's just not as refined. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 80/20/78/.259/.322/.438/23

8) Chase Petty - CIN, RHP, 22.0 - Petty was known as a flamethrower in his draft year, throwing mid to upper 90's, but he was more of a low to mid 90's, plus control guy in his pro career prior to this season. He worked on regaining that velocity this off-season, and it worked with him back up into the mid 90's all season. It came at the cost of his control, and he didn't have a particularly great year, but we are watching the development of a very talented, first round high school arm right before our eyes on the professional level. He was a freshly turned 21 in the upper minors all season and put up a 4.20 ERA with a 22.4/10.2 K%/BB% in 137 IP. He racked up innings, he maintained his stuff, and he more than held his own against much older competition. He has an excellent bat missing secondary in his slider, he has a solid change to use against lefties, and the big velocity is back. I'm sure he's going to go back in the lab this off-season to continue to improve and work on his game. He's not a truly coveted pitching prospect, but he's a still a good one. 2025 Projection: 1/4.44/1.38/38 in 45 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/174 in 170 IP

9) Rece Hinds - CIN, OF, 24.7 - How can a guy who put up a 1.051 OPS with 5 homers and 2 steals in his 51 PA MLB debut not make this list? Well, I guess the answer to that question is by striking out 37.9% of the time and putting up a 68 wRC+ at Triple-A. Maybe he shouldn't make this list, but Hinds has very real upside, and he's close to the majors, so let's roll the dice. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 215 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He had a 29.2 ft/sec sprint with a 91.6 MPH EV and 18.9 degree launch in the majors. He smacked 14 homers with 20 steals in 99 games at Triple-A. If he can even strikeout just like 32% of the time, he could do some major fantasy damage, as he did in the majors with a 31.4% K%. Odds are he can't hit enough to become an MLB regular, but in shallower leagues especially, why not take a shot on this kind of close to the majors upside at this point in the rankings. In a deeper league, he likely wouldn't crack my Top 10 though. 2025 Projection; 16/6/21/.207/.266/.412/3 Prime Projection: 42/16/56/.219/.282/.432/10

10) Luke Holman - CIN, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 71st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Holman is a safety over upside arm with a strong history of production in the toughest conference in college baseball (SEC). He put up a 2.75 ERA with a 33.7/8.8 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP this year. The stuff isn't off the charts, but the low to mid 90's fastball is a good pitch with good life and bat missing ability. The slider is his best secondary and it misses a ton of bats, and he has a good curve too. The control/command is about average. It's not the most enticing profile, but it's why he will be available pretty late in first year player drafts, and he's not a bad option if you are looking for a fast moving college arm. It's also not like he's completely devoid of upside at 6'4'', 200 pounds, so there is certainly room to tack on a MPH or two on the fastball. I could have gone with any of the names in the just missed section over Holman, as they all have similar value to me, but why not highlight a fresh name rather than guys who I've been writing about for years now. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.12/1.32/128 in 150 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

I've already patted myself on the back for my futures bet of Tarik Skubal leading the league in strikeouts, and I nailed my Pittsburgh Pirates Wins Over bet, but my Cincinnati Reds Wins Over bet was a disaster the second their entire team started dropping like flies in March, and now is the time for me to take my Walk of Shame on that. Those were literally the only 3 future bets I made (with some Pirates and Reds WS bets sprinkled in just for long shot funsies), so overall it was a good showing, but the plan was to go perfect (at least on the Pirates and Reds wins bet), so I do have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. If you would have told me that Hunter Greene and Elly would have the years they just had, I would have assumed the Reds were maybe one of the best teams in baseball, but baseball is a team game, and it didn't play out like that. I could bemoan the injuries and make excuses, but that is part of gambling, and a loss is a loss. I was absolutely perfect on these team O/U bets going on 3 years now, but this is a reminder that no matter how much it looks like a lock, anything can happen. Only bet what you can afford to lose. It is for entertainment only.
