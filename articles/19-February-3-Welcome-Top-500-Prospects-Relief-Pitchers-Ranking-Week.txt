Welcome to Top 500 Prospects and Relief Pitchers Rankings Week!

New
February 3

I don't want to hold off on releasing the Top 500 Prospects Rankings any later than I have to, and with all of the player writeups complete, I will be dropping that full list tomorrow. That will be followed up by the Top 70+ Relief Pitcher Rankings. Those rankings are for saves only leagues, but they will also include most of the top setup men in the game, so they can be used for all leagues. It's just that the placement will be for saves in mind. I play in plenty of leagues with SV/HLD as one category and also leagues with SV and Holds as two separate categories, and personally, I still like using a Saves only relief pitcher ranking for those leagues as well, and I make my own adjustments based on if Holds is a separate cat or not. I just find it's easier to organize things in my mind that way. Maybe that's just me though. Either way, Top 500 Prospects Rankings is coming tom, and then it's all about the pen arms ...
