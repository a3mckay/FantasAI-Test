*The Top 1,000 Dynasty Rankings will drop on Tuesday with the All-In-One Spreadsheet coming shortly after that. Position by Position Targets, OBP Rankings, Top 10 2026 FYPD Rankings, Predicting the Top 50 2026 Prospects Ranks (which doubles as a bold predictions article) and much more coming after that!

1) Mason Miller - OAK, Closer, 26.7 - The Athletics made a compromise to keep Miller healthy by putting him in the bullpen, and he was so utterly dominant, it almost makes you tempted to wish they roll the dice on him in the rotation again. But my granddaddy always said you don't look a gift horse in the mouth (my granddaddy never said that, and I never called him granddaddy either), so let's be happy with the electric season he just put together. He had a 2.49 ERA with a 41.8/8.4 K%/BB% in 65 IP. His 41.8% K% led all of baseball with pitchers over 30 IP. His 100.9 MPH fastball was the fastest pitch in baseball. The slider put up a .141 xwOBA which was the top mark in baseball on sliders thrown more than 250 times (if you lower the threshold to 150 pitches, fellow Oakland reliever Michel Otanez holds first place, who is an interesting upside setup arm to target). Quite simply, he is the #1 dynasty relief pitcher in the game in any format. The only question is if Oakland will get the itch to put him back in the rotation, and while I would be scared to death, I would absolutely love it if they did. If not, the best reliever in baseball is not a bad consolation prize. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.59/0.94/100/33 saves in 65 IP

2) Emmanuel Clase - CLE, Closer, 27.0 - As usual, Clase finished well out in front of the pack in saves with 47, 2nd to only Ryan Helsley's 49, and 9 saves above 3rd place. Saves tend to be kinda variable, but not for Clase, it's a damn skill at this point. And I guess it doesn't hurt that the guy simply doesn't give up runs. He put up a 0.61 ERA in 74.1 IP in 2024, and he has a career 1.67 ERA in 312.2 IP. Come to think of it, not only does he rack up saves, he racks up innings. Most relievers are lucky to get over 60-65, while Clase has put up over 72.2 innings for the last 3 years. The 24.4% K% definitely hurts a bit, but honestly, with how great he is at everything else, I'm not sure it really matters. He's as elite as they come and is definitely a contender for top relief pitcher in the game regardless of format. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.31/0.93/67/43 saves in 72 IP

3) Josh Hader - HOU, Closer, 31.0 - Hader is starting to creep up there in age. He's not old enough to start worrying about it, but it is something to keep in the back of your mind if you find yourself needing to kick start a mini rebuild or bridge year. Just saying that it could be the year to trade him at peak value if it makes sense for your team during the season. He's shown zero signs of decline with a 40.5% whiff% and a 2.72 xERA, so he should remain elite for several more years, but once you get that "old" label in dynasty, the trade offers get smaller and smaller, and I don't think anyone thinks of Hader as old right now. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.70/1.05/97/34 saves in 65 IP

4) Ryan Helsley - STL, Closer, 30.9 - Helsley stole the saves crown away from the 2 two time defending champ, Emmanuel Clase, notching 49 saves. He did it on the back of a 99.6 MPH fastball and an elite slider that notched a 51% whiff% and .206 xwOBA. The swing and miss is elite with a 36.1% whiff%, and while he's had bouts of wild control in the past, the walk rate was about average this year at 8.6%. It's his 3rd year in a row of being an elite reliever, so while he doesn't feel quite as established as the other elite options, he's just as locked in as an elite guy. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.56/1.08/84/36 saves in 65 IP

5) Devin Williams - NYY, Closer, 30.6 - Williams made his season debut in late July coming off a back injury, and it was clear very quickly that he was 100%. He closed out the season with a 1.25 ERA and 43.2/12.5 K%/BB% in 21.1 IP. He has a career 1.83 ERA with a 39.4% K% in 235.2 IP. He's as elite as they come. 2025 Projection: 4/2.51/1.04/89/33 saves in 60 IP

6) Edwin Diaz NYM, Closer, 30.11 - Diaz returned from a torn ACL that kept him out for all of 2023, and other than a small mid-season hiccup with a right shoulder impingement, he was mostly back to his dominant self. He put up a 3.52 ERA (2.48 xERA) with a 38.9/9.3 K%/BB% in 53.2 IP. The fastball sat 97.5 MPH and put up an elite 36.6% whiff%, and the slider is double plus with a .223 xwOBA and 39.4% whiff%. It does sometimes feel like he has a few more "hiccups" then he should, but that could also just be the inherent small sample nature of being a reliever. He's in the elite tier of the elite tier. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.98/1.01/98/31 saves in 60 IP

7) Jhoan Duran - MIN, Closer, 27.3 - Duran is definitely the main closer in Minnesota, but they are not afraid to mix it up a little, so it does depress his saves totals a bit. He saved 23 games and had 7 holds in 54.1 IP. He missed the first month of the season with an oblique injury, so that played into the small save total too. Regardless of him losing some saves, he's an elite (or maybe more accurately near elite as there are some damn good closers these days) closer with an elite 100.5 MPH fastball that notched a 36.1% whiff%, to go along with an elite curveball and good splitter. It led to a 2.70 xERA (3.64 ERA) with a 28.9/6.6 K%/BB%. Because he loses enough save chances to make a dent in his totals, I would consider him in the low end of the first tier of closers. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.94/1.10/84/29 saves in 65 IP

8) Andres Munoz - SEA, Closer, 26.3 - Munoz only closed 22 games in 59.1 IP because Seattle was mixing and matching with him early in the season, and also because of a mid-season back injury that interrupted his season for a bit. Seattle does like to mix and match a bit, so it's possible his save totals won't be quite as high as the top guys in the league. He's pretty close to elite other than that though with a 2.12 ERA and 33.2/11.2 K%/BB%. The fastball sits 98.4 MPH, the slider is elite with a 48.5% whiff%, and the 97.5 MPH sinker is filthy with a negative 10 degree launch and 45% whiff%. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.78/1.10/83/30 saves in 62 IP

9) Felix Bautista - BAL, Closer, 29.9 - Bautista underwent Tommy John surgery in October of 2023, and all signs seem to point to a smooth recovery process, so he should be good to go for 2025. If he is legitimately fully healthy, there is zero doubt that he is the elite of the elite with a 1.48 ERA and 46.4/11.0 K%/BB% in 61 IP in 2023. The 99.5 MPH fastball notched a 37.8% whiff% and the splitter was untouchable with a 60.2% whiff% and .113 xwOBA. As we've seen with pitchers coming back from Tommy John though, it is not a guarantee that they are actually 100% healthy. Sometimes everything is back but the control. Sometimes everything is back but the secondaries. Sometimes the velocity is a bit down. Sometimes there are setbacks. On a general dynasty ranking, I think factoring in some of that risk is the right play, but for your personal dynasty team, if you want to just assume he will be fully healthy and elite, I have no problem with that. He was also so insanely good, that if he takes a step back, he could still be the best closer in baseball. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.95/0.98/88/32 saves in 60 IP

10) Ben Joyce - LAA, Closer, 24.7 - Joyce becoming the Angels closer was always his destiny since they selected him 89th overall, fast tracking him through the minors, and he now looks on the precipice of fulfilling that prophesy. He was in the process of locking down the job post trade deadline with 4 saves from August 3rd through September 3rd, but he then suffered a shoulder impingement which ended his season (it doesn't seem like it's serious). And we all know he most certainly has closer stuff, which is a understatement with a 102.1 MPH fastball that dominated MLB hitters with a .269 xwOBA and 29.8% whiff%. His 97.4 MPH sinker is dominant too with a negative 12 degree launch and 25.3% whiff%. The only thing keeping him out of the no doubt elite tier is that his slider isn't all that great. It put up a .339 xwOBA with a 32.1% whiff%, and it wasn't very good in 2023 either. His new changeup was actually really good with a 44.4% whiff%, but he only went to it 3.9% of the time, so maybe he develops that pitch more in 2025. It all resulted in a 2.08 ERA with a 23.2/9.9 K%/BB% in 34.2 IP. The 29% whiff% overall is much better than the K%, so I wouldn't be too worried about that. Control is his biggest problem, and it definitely adds some volatility to the profile, but not enough to scare me off. It would be premature to put him in the elite or even near elite closer range, but he so obviously has the talent to end up there. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.32/1.17/71/29 saves in 62 IP

11) Ryan Walker - SFG, Closer, 29.4 - Doval's well below average control ended up tanking him, and Walker swooped right in to lock down San Francisco's closer job. He also has the no doubt stuff and production to hold the job with a 1.91 ERA and 32.1/5.8 K%/BB% in 80 IP. The 95.6 MPH sinker induces weak contact, and the plus to double plus slider misses bats. The 28.6% whiff% overall isn't quite as impressive at the K rate, and the 18.8% whiff% on the sinker, and 38% whiff% on the slider is good, but not great for a reliever. I suspect he isn't quite as good as he showed in 2024, but he's still really good. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.05/1.09/80/32 saves in 65 IP

12) Trevor Megill - MIL, Closer, 31.3 - With Devin Williams shipped out of town, Megill will get the first shot to nail down the closer job, and while I think he will do it, there is some risk after he faltered down the stretch. He dominated to start the season with a 1.53 ERA and 35/7 K/BB in 29.1 IP, but after missing time with a back injury, the stuff was down, the control was off, and the performance dropped upon his return. He put up a 4.76 ERA with a 15/7 K/BB in 17 IP to close out the season (although he was lights out in 2 playoff appearances). He most certainly has closer stuff with a 98.8 MPH fastball and a slider that put up a 55% whiff%. He's always had solid control too. The potential is there for him to be an elite or near elite closer, but there is just enough risk with his performance down the stretch that I want to have the smallest bit of caution before really ranking him in the elite area. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.17/1.11/78/30 saves in 60 IP

13) Raisel Iglesias - ATL, Closer, 35.3 - Iglesias' K/9 fell below 9.00 for the first time in his career with a 8.83 K/9, but with a 31.5% whiff%, I would have zero concerns about that. Not to mention that it also came with career bests in ERA (1.95), WHIP (0.74) and BB/9 (1.69). There are zero signs of a decline with a double plus 4 pitch. The changeup, 4-seamer, slider and sinker put up a .249, .221, .190. and .285 xwOBA, which is quite remarkable. He's old, but he's still elite. - 2025 Projection: 5/2.73/0.95/74/33 saves in 65 IP

14) Jeff Hoffman - TOR, Closer, 32.3 - Hoffman signed a 3 year, $33 million control with Toronto, so they are obviously confident enough in his health, but word on the street is that other teams passed on him after he failed their physicals. All relievers are super volatile, so I don't want to be too scared off, but it's hard not to at least take that into account. He was fully healthy in 2024, and he was straight up elite with a 2.17 ERA and 33.6/6.0 K%/BB% in 66 IP. He throws gas with a bat missing 96.6 MPH fastball, the heavily used slider is elite, and the lesser used splitter is also elite. Assuming full health, he is in the elite of the elite, but he's already 32 years old, and failing multiple physicals doesn't seem like a great omen. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.98/1.01/79/30 saves in 62 IP

15) AJ Puk - ARI, Closer Committe, 29.11 - Puk and Justin Martinez seem to be in some kind of closer competition and/or committee, and the tie usually goes to the righty for the lion's share of the job. But in this case, it might not be a tie as Puk is better than Martinez and safer than Martinez. Martinez also has control issues which could tank him (like we saw with Doval and Diaz in 2024), but plenty of elite closers have below average control, so just because the risk of implosion is higher, it doesn't mean it's going to happen. Puk on his own merits is a truly elite relief pitcher with a 1.72 ERA and 35.0/5.1 K%/BB% in 57.2 IP once being transitioned back to the bullpen after a short stint as a starter (which didn't work out). The fastball and slider are elite, and he also throws a good sweeper and sinker. Your guess is as good as mine as to how this situation will shake out, but my gut is telling me to bet on the better reliever, which is Puk, lefty be damned. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.96/1.08/82/23 saves in 65 IP

16) Pete Fairbanks - TBR, Closer, 31.3 - I guess Fairbanks is the favorite for saves in Tampa if he's healthy after saving 23 games in 2024 and 25 saves in 2023, but there are a lot of red flags here. For one, he's never pitched more than 45.1 IP in an MLB season, and his 2024 ended in mid August with a lat strain. He also showed signs of decline in 2024 with a pretty mediocre season compared to his past few years with a 3.57 ERA and 23.8/9.2 K%/BB%. His career K rate is 31.7%, so that is a big drop, and the whiff% dropped majorly too (21.8%), so it doesn't look like an aberration or bad luck. His stuff was still good with a 97.3 MPH fastball, so maybe there is just a weird small sample reliever thing going on. He's a really weird evaluation, and it's even harder with not knowing if he's truly locked into the closer job, or how much leash he is going to get. I'm treading carefully here - 2025 Projection: 3/3.41/1.17/61/24 saves in 55 IP

17) Tanner Scott - LAD, Closer Committee, 30.8 - Scott signed a 4 year, $72 million control with the Dodgers, so on contract alone you have to think the Dodgers like Scott the best out of their options. But just because they like him the best, doesn't mean he is going to get the full time closer job, and being the best lefty in their pen, it probably means they aren't going to want to lock him into the 9th. He also still has control issues with a 12.2% BB% in 72 IP, which is another reason I would hesitate to even call him the favorite. He'll surely be in the mix though, and he could easily emerge as the guy. He's damn good with a 1.75 ERA and 28.6% K% on the back of a truly elite 97.8 MPH fastball and plus slider. But without a guarantee that he has the job, I can't go any higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.01/1.17/77/18 saves in 66 IP

18) Justin Martinez - ARI, Closer Committee, 23.8 - Martinez is in a competition/committee with AJ Puk, but as I wrote in the Puk blurb, my money is on Puk if I had to choose. Martinez just isn't as good, and the 11.7% BB% and 1.31 WHIP in 72.2 IP shows the added risk which has me leaning Puk. He most certainly has closer stuff with a 100.2 MPH sinker and two whiff machine secondaries in his splitter and slider. It was good for a 2.48 ERA and 29.5% K%. He's the righty, which generally gets the lean when it comes to closers. Just because I think Puk has the edge, doesn't mean it's going to play out like that. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.32/1.27/81/14 saves in 65 IP

19) Aaron Ashby - MIL, Setup, 26.10 - Ashby underwent shoulder surgery in April 2023 and didn't truly get back to full health until late May/early June of this year. Even with his stuff back, he still struggled mightily with his control as a starter in the minors, but once they transitioned him to the bullpen, all hell broke loose. He immediately dominated in the role at Triple-A, and then he rolled it right into the majors with a 1.37 ERA and 36.8/3.9 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP. The sinker sat 96.2 MPH and put up a .291 xwOBA with a 2 degree launch. His changeup (37% whiff%), curveball (42.9% whiff%) and slider (43.8% whiff%) all racked up whiffs. If they keep him in the pen, it's quite clear he can be a truly elite reliever, but if they decide to put him back in the rotation, he would certainly be one of the leading candidates to go all Garrett Crochet on us. Even as a starter, the velocity was averaging between 94-95 MPH by the end of May. Due to the injuries and control problems as a starter, they may never make that move, but he has the pitch mix for it, and it's not like Milwaukee has a stacked rotation, so they may have to give it a go out of necessity at some point. Either way, Ashby is looking like a great target this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.72/1.27/111 in 95 IP

20) Orion Kerkering - PHI, Setup, 24.0 - Philly signed Jordan Romano, which knocks Kerkering out of the pole position for saves, and while I do think he's next man up, Philly loves to mix and match, so there are no guarantees of that. Philly had 8 players receive saves and nobody saved more than 13 games last year (Jose Alvarado, who is still on the team). Maybe that means Kerkering can still get saves even if Romano is solid, and I still think Kerkering eventually ascends to the closer of the future role. He's not quite good enough to put in the truly elite tier, but he's not far off. He put up a 2.29 ERA with a 28.8/6.6 K%/BB% in 63 IP. The fastball sat 97.6 MPH and was a plus to double plus weapon with a .261 xwOBA and 27.2% whiff%. The sweeper was his most used pitch with a 55.7% usage, and while it's a good pitch, the 31.1% whiff% and .294 xwOBA aren't eye popping, which is the only thing keeping him out of the truly elite range (for now). And he has plus control, which is a nice bonus for a top end reliever as many of them have high risk walk rates (hello, Camilo Doval and Alexis Diaz). The Romano signing is a hit, but I still like him a lot for dynasty leagues - 2025 Projection: 5/2.87/1.03/79/13 saves in 65 IP

21) Jordan Romano - PHI, Closer, 31.11 - Romano got a few week late start to the season due to an elbow injury, was really bad for two months with a 6.58 ERA and 21/6.5 K%/BB% in 13.2 IP, and then he hit the IL with an elbow injury that ended his season. The word is that he will be fully healthy for 2025, but the weird thing is that he wasn't really showing signs of being hurt before going down with the injury. The velocity was completely normal at 96.4 MPH and the control was actually better. There are other ways an injury could impact your effectiveness, like the spin rate being down on the fastball, which it was, but I still find it adds an oddity to evaluating Romano. I guess you have to blame the injury for the terrible the season, and if he's fully healthy, the assumption is that he gets back to being a nearly elite reliever with a 3.00 ERA and upper 20's K rates. But for one, there is no guarantee he's actually fully healthy (and stays that way), and I still don't love the extreme performance drop when he was on the mound. He only landed a 1 year, $8.5 million deal, which tells me MLB teams are hesitant to bet on him returning to form. Philly has other good options to close and they love to mix and match. I wouldn't mind grabbing Romano if he drops, but I'm worried his name value will push him higher than I'm willing to go, and since he's only on a one year deal, who knows where he ends up in 2026 and beyond. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.65/1.25/66/24 saves in 60 IP

22) Porter Hodge - CHC, Setup, 24.1 - Chicago traded for Pressly, and you have to think Pressly will get the first shot at the job. Maybe he will scuffle, and he's only under contract for one year, but this is a big blow to Hodge's dynasty value. Before adding Pressly, I was really loving Hodge though. He took over the closer job in late August and he ran with it, locking down 8 saves in his final 13 appearances. He was lights out when he got the call to the bigs in late May, putting up a 1.88 ERA with a 31.7/11.6 K%/BB% in 43 IP. The stuff is most certainly closer stuff with the best sweeper in baseball that put up a +11 Run Value (tied with Anthony Bender) with a 51.8% whiff%. The fastball sits 95.5 MPH and put up very good .298 xwOBA. Below average control is the only thing that can tank him, and while plenty of elite closers have below average control, there is still some risk there as we saw with Camilo Doval and Alexis Diaz last year. It seems he's the closer of the future at the least, but Chicago could easily do the same think next off-season that they did this off-season by bringing in a vet, so nothing is guaranteed. Either way, he's a top setup option on his own merits, and there is still a path to saves in both the short and long term. 2025 Projection: 4/3.41/1.18/77/10 saves in 63 IP

23) Griffin Jax - MIN, Setup, 30.4 - Jax' velocity increased every year of his career, going from 92.6 MPH in 2021 (as a starter), to 95.4 MPH in 2022, to 96.5 MPH in 2023, and finally 97.1 MPH in 2024. And it's resulted in him going from good, to one of the best relievers in baseball this year. He put up a 2.03 ERA with a 34.4/5.4 K%/BB% in 71 IP. The 37.8% whiff% backs up the exploding K rate (24.8% K% in 2023). His sweeper (which also jumped 2.1 MPH), 4-seamer and changeup are all plus to double weapons, racking up whiffs, and the control is plus. He was so good that it earned him save chances throughout the entire season, nabbing 10 of them. 4 of them came in the first month of the season when Duran was out, so I don't think this is a committee or anything, but like I mentioned in the Duran blurb, they will mix and match a bit. - 2025 Projection: 6/2.83/0.97/86/9 saves in 67 IP

24) Carlos Estevez - KCR, Closer, 32.3 - Just call him the spoiler, because Estevez keeps taking the closer job from far more fun options. Lucas Erceg was all set to hit the scene as the hot new closer, but no no no, here comes Estevez after signing a 2 year, $22 million deal. You have to think Estevez is the heavy favorite to get the first crack at the closer role, and while he's not a great reliever, he's good enough to hang onto the role. He put up a 2.46 ERA with a 23.6/5.7 K%/BB% in 55 IP. He throws gas with a 96.8 MPH fastball, and he has two good secondaries in his slider and changeup. Maybe Erceg wrangles the role from him mid-season, or maybe I have it wrong and they go with Erceg, but as of now, I'm drafting as if Estevez starts the year as the closer. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.61/1.23/60/24 saves in 60 IP

25) David Bednar - PIT, Closer, 30.6 - Despite David shitting the Bed ... nar, it seems like Pitt is set on giving him another crack at it in 2025. He straight up imploded in 2024 with a 5.78 ERA and 22.1/10.7 K%/BB% in 57.2 IP, but his stuff was actually up a tick, so maybe there was just some classic small sample, reliever volatility going on there. Relievers are known to have some wonky years because they simply don't pitch enough innings for things to "normalize." He was bad all year though, so it certainly didn't feel like an aberration. He'll have to prove himself in spring, and throughout the season, as I'm sure the leash is going to be short, but as of now, he seems like the man, and because his stuff was still excellent, I'm apt to take a flier on him as a team who usually waits on saves. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.77/1.24/68/28 saves in 62 IP

26) Seth Halvorsen - COL, Closer Committee, 25.1 - It seems Halvosen is the best bet for the closer job in Colorado, but that isn't locked in yet. He had a great MLB debut with a 1.46 ERA and 28.3/4.3 K%/BB% in 12.1 IP. The 99.9 MPH fastball was a plus pitch with a .240 xwOBA and 25% whiff%, and he combines that with a bat missing splitter and slider. That is a pretty classic back end of the bullpen profile. He wasn't as good at Triple-A as he was in the majors with a 4.47 ERA and 28.6/11.7 K%/BB% in 44.1 IP, so I would be careful about buying the small sample MLB debut too hard, but Colorado doesn't have any better options, and at only 25, he very well could lock in this role for several years. The upside is there too. I actually don't mind him despite pitching in Coors. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.83/1.30/65/24 saves in 60 IP

27) Lucas Erceg - KCR, Setup, 29.11 - KC brought in Estevez, and I have to think that makes Estevez the favorite for the first shot at saves. Estevez isn't great, but he's good enough to hold the job, which is a big hit to Erceg's value, but that doesn't mean I don't like Erceg at all anymore. I was relatively high on him last off-season, ranking him pretty high among non closers, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "Erceg could factor into the saves mix, and he has the big stuff to make an impact if his control can take one step forward. The sinker sat 98 MPH and is a plus, bat missing pitch, to go along with two good bat missing secondaries in his slider and changeup. He got drafted as a hitter in 2016, and only got transitioned to a pitcher in 2021, so there could more upside in the tank here than your average 28 year old." ... not only did his control take one step forward, it took 8 steps forward, improving his walk rate 8 percentage points to a well above average 6.3%. It led to a full on breakout with a 3.36 ERA and a 28.5% K%, culminating with him taking over the full time closer job with Kansas City after he got traded there at the deadline. He throws a devasting 4 pitch mix with two upper 90's fastball and 2 bat missing secondaries. He maintained the control gains all season too, which gives confidence that he can maintain a least a large portion of those gains. Estevez got signed for two years, so it's not even easy enough to say Erceg is the closer of the future. He's going to need Estevez to scuffle, or just be so insanely good himself he gives KC no choice. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.30/1.11/76/15 saves in 64 IP

28) Jeremiah Estrada - SDP, Setup, 26.5 - Estrada is the young gun in San Diego's bullpen, and while he has two vets ahead of him on the depth chart right now, he seems to be the favorite for the closer of the future job. And who knows, maybe he sneaks in there in 2025 too. He just put up a 2.95 ERA with a 37.3/9.1 K%/BB% in 61 IP. The 97.2 MPH fastball is elite with a 32.6% whiff%, the splitter is elite with a 51% whiff%, and the slider is above average. I don't believe he's as good as he showed in 2024, but that really isn't a knock as he was ridiculous in 2024. He has elite reliever potential, but he's not quite established enough to put him in that tier quite yet. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.29/1.17/85/5 saves in 63 IP

29) Ryan Pressly - CHC, Closer, 36.3 - Pressly was traded to the Cubs, and while nothing has been announced, my gut says that he will get the first shot at locking down the closer job. It seems the highly paid veteran with a long track record is almost always given precedence over the high octane, up and coming youngster. But just because Pressly is likely to get the first shot, doesn't mean he can't falter, because he's been on the decline for 2 years in a row now, and he'll be 36 years old in the last year of his contract. The fastball velocity was down to 93.8 MPH, which is down about 2 ticks from his prime, and it was continuing to drop as the year went along. The whiffs are also down considerably, dropping from the mid to high 30's in his prime, to 26.9% in 2024. He was still solid with a 3.49 ERA in 56.2 IP, but the 23.8/7.4 K%/BB% isn't as impressive. My guess is that he'll probably be good enough to hang onto the job in 2025, but there is no guarantee of that, and with only 1 more year left on his contract, there is no guarantee of him finding a closer job beyond this season. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.67/1.26/67/25 saves in 60 IP

30) Kirby Yates - LAD, Closer Committee, 38.0 - I don't have the slightest clue how LA's bullpen is going to shake out, but I guess Yates has as good a chance as any to emerge as the man. He's 38 years old but he's coming off an elite season with a 1.17 ERA and 35.9/11.8 K%/BB% in 61.2 IP, and the Dodgers just paid him $13 million, so they surely think he can at least come close to repeating that in 2025. He's 38 and he has tons of competition, so it's hard to really bank on him being the closer until it's official, but my gut is kinda saying he could be the main righty. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.28/1.18/78/20 saves in 60 IP

31) Robert Suarez - SDP, Closer, 34.1 - Suarez is 34 years old, he doesn't put up typical closer K rates with a 22.9% K%, and he struggled in the 2nd half with a 5.66 ERA and 16/7 K/BB in his final 20.2 IP. San Diego has other good options on their team like Jason Adam and Jeremiah Estrada, who are both probably better than Suarez, and there are trade rumors swirling around Suarez too. I'm just saying I'm not so sure Suarez has a super safe hold on the job, and he most certainly is not going to get a very long leash. He still had a really good season with a 2.77 ERA in 65 IP, and he throws gas with a 99.1 MPH 4-seamer, to go along with a lesser used sinker that keeps the ball on the ground and changeup that gets whiffs. He definitely has the goods to hold the job down, I'm just saying there are some cracks in the armor with ready, willing, and able replacements waiting nearby. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.44/1.09/60/22 saves in 65 IP

32) Edwin Uceta - TBR, Setup, 27.3 - Let's just start with Uceta putting up a 1.51 ERA with a 35.8/5.0 K%/BB% in 41.2 IP. That is straight elite, and if I could fully trust it, I would bet on him passing Fairbanks for the closer role, but you can't really fully bet on it. He wasn't nearly as good at Triple-A with a 5.77 ERA and 29.7/10.1 K%/BB% in 34.1 IP, and he's not your typical flame throwing back end guy with a 94.2 MPH 4-seamer. Now having said that, the guy is a whiff machine. That fastball put up a 36.6% whiff% with a .187 xwOBA, and he the pairs that with an elite changeup that put up a .189 xwOBA and 37.4% whiff%. He also throws a good cutter. Uceta used to be a starter when he started his career in the minors, and honestly, he would be a super fun candidate to transition back into the rotation. The Rays need him more in the pen than in the rotation, so I doubt it happens, but it would be fun. Maybe down the line? But back to the present, if Fairbanks falters, it looks like Uceta is next in line, and while I wouldn't trust the small sample 2024, he could still be very good with legit K upside. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.61/1.22/79/13 saves in 65 IP

33) Cade Smith - CLE, Setup, 25.11 - Cade Smith had the most valuable 4-seam fastball in all of baseball last year. And that is not on a per pitch basis. That is overall, which is even more impressive for a reliever to hold the top spot there. And it also wasn't even close. That pitch put up a 28 run value while the next closest was Hunter Greene with 20. It resulted in an unreal season with a 1.91 ERA and 35.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 75.1 IP. He was almost even more impressive in the post season with a 3.60 ERA and 43.2/5.4 K%/BB% in 10 IP. He's obviously really good, but I'm not sure the underlying stats show him to be quite that good (which would be hard for anyone to maintain). The 30.2% whiff% is good, but not as good as the K rate, and none of his pitches put up more than a 30.4% whiff%. The splitter was an excellent pitch with a .231 xwOBA, but it only had a 29.9% whiff%, and the sweeper wasn't very good. He also got hit relatively hard with a 90.4 MPH EV and 8.4% Barrel% against. Hard to say he still isn't one of the top setup men to go after in 2025, but I don't know, I'm going to at least be keeping in mind that there could be some regression next year. - 2025 Projection: 5/2.84/0.96/94/3 saves in 70 IP

34) Bryan Abreu - HOU, Setup, 27.11 - Abreu wasn't quite as good in 2024 as he was in 2022-23, but he was still elite with a 3.10 ERA and 31.7/9.8 K%/BB% in 78.1 IP. He's firmly established as one of the top setup men in the game, if not the top guy. Hader is locked into the closer role, but an injury would turn Abreu into an elite closer immediately, and a Hader trade could also get him into the role, but I guess in that scenario, Abreu could be the next one out the door anyway. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.02/1.15/93/5 saves in 70 IP

35) Aroldis Chapman - BOS, Closer Committee, 37.1 - Chapman and Hendriks will battle it out for the closer role in Spring, and I guess it's conceivable they form a committee if both are pitching well. If I had to bet on one taking the role though, Chapman seems like the safer, more predictable choice. He's still an absolute strikeout machine with a 37.1% K% in 61.2 IP. He's a wild man too with a 14.4% BB%, and it all resulted in a 3.79 ERA and 2.98 xERA. His fastball velocity is in decline, but he had so much to spare that he's still throwing 97.8 MPH. The 32.3% whiff% isn't quite as impressive as the K%, and it's not as good as previous seasons, and his 90.5 MPH EV against is a career worst by far. Those are 3 signs of decline, along with the terrible walk rates, and he's going to be 37. I may give the edge to Chapman, but it's possible his decline continues in 2025, so nothing is certain. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.57/1.29/89/20 saves in 60 IP

36) Kenley Jansen - FRA, Closer, 37.6 - Jansen is still a free agent, and while it seems likely that he can land a closer job, there is no guarantee of that. He also closed the year with a shoulder issue, which isn't great. He's far from his prime, but he was so insanely good in his prime, that even being a shell of his former self is still a good reliever. He put up a 3.29 ERA with a 28.8/9.2 K%/BB% in 54.2 IP. He does it with basically one pitch at this point, and it's the cutter which put up a 84.9% usage, .298 xwOBA, and 28.2% whiff%. His value will rise or fall depending on where he lands, but even if he does land a closer job, his time is running out. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.58/1.17/66/25 saves in 60 IP

37) Liam Hendriks - BOS, Closer Committee, 36.2 - Hendriks returned from Tommy John surgery in August for a rehab assignment at Triple-A. His stuff was down 2 ticks and he didn't look great over 5 outings. He then went back on the IL after suffering a setback. All indications are that he's having a normal off-season and will be ready to go for 2025, but who knows exactly how healthy he's going to look. He missed almost the entire 2023 and 2024 season, and he's 36 years old. He was basically the Jacob deGrom of relief pitchers before going down with the injury, putting up minuscule ERA's with like a 40.0/3.0 K%/BB%, so I guess even a diminished version of himself can be very good, but there is also a chance the cliff has come, and he will just never be close to the same. The upside is higher than Chapman, but so is the risk. Seeing how he looks in Spring will swing his value majorly. -2025 Projection: 2/3.75/1.20/45/10 saves in 40 IP

38) Mason Montgomery - TBR, Setup, 24.10 - Montgomery got transitioned to the bullpen in 2024, and to say he took to it well would be an understatement. He absolutely exploded with a 1.86 ERA and 45.9/13.5 K%?BB% in 9.2 IP. His stuff exploded too with a 97.3 MPH fastball that put up a 43.1% whiff%, to go along with a slider that put up a 56% whiff%. The control is below average, but this looks like it can end up a truly elite pen arm. And it's not like Tampa's pen is set in stone. He could emerge as a true elite closer option quite quickly, even if being a lefty makes it hard to really bank on that, and also the fact he can go multiple innings. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.39/1.19/90/3 saves in 70 IP

39) Jesus Tinoco - MIA, Closer Committee, 29.11 - Tinoco closed the season out in September as Miami's closer, and even though he was a mid-season waiver wire pickup (I'm talking real life waiver wire, not fantasy waiver wire ... well, I guess fantasy waiver too), I kinda like him the most out of Miami's current options, but your guess is as good as mine. He has closer stuff with a 96.1 MPH sinker that keeps the ball on the ground (5 degree launch) to go along with an at least plus slider that put up a .192 xwOBA and a 37.6% whiff%. It led to a 3.32 ERA, 3.32 xERA, and a 25.9/7.4 K%/BB% in 40.2 IP. He doesn't have a long track with a mediocre at best minor league career (hence the part where he was waiver wire fodder), so this type of reliever is very volatile, but at the same time, tons of good relievers pop up like this "out of nowhere." He's a very low end option, but I might take some very late shots for saves needy teams - 2025 Projection: 3/3.51/1.19/63/20 saves in 60 IP

40) Jason Foley - DET, Closer Committee, 29.5 - Foley saved 28 games in 2024, so he's the presumed favorite for saves, but his hold on the role seems very precarious. Detroit would also be a candidate to trade for a pen arm during the season even if Foley can make it through the off-season. His strikeout rates just aren't good enough to feel safe with him with a 18.4/8.0 K%/BB% in 60 IP. He had a 3.15 ERA and he has a career 3.16 ERA in 199.2 IP, so it's certainly possible he can hang onto the role. He does it with a 96.9 MPH sinker that keeps the ball on the ground to go along with an above average slider. He's a very low end option. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.45/1.21/52/20 saves in 63 IP

41) Jorge Lopez - WSH, Closer Committee, 32.2 - I have no idea what Washington is going to do with their bullpen, but as of now, they have no great options. Lopez could be the best of their bad options. After his on field meltdown with the Mets, he came back a new man with Chicago, putting up a 2.03 ERA with a 29.2/7.5 K%/BB% in 26.2 IP. I thought it was too harsh for the Mets to cut him, so I'm happy he came back and redeemed himself. His velocity was up with Chicago, so he was clearly amped up to shove it in the Mets faces. Which also begs the question, was he not trying that hard with the Mets? He throws 2 mid 90's fastballs and he has 3 good secondaries in his slider, curve and changeup. The ingredients are definitely in here to be good, and quite frankly, he was good in 2 for the last 3 years. I actually think I talked myself into him. I like him as a late round saves option. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.70/1.25/65/22 saves in 65 IP

42) Alexis Diaz - CIN, Closer, 28.6 - Diaz showed signs of imploding in the 2nd half of 2023, and that proved to be a signal, as he was pretty bad in 2024. He put up a 3.99 ERA with a 22.7/12.8 K%/BB%. The velocity dropped for the 2nd year in a row and now sits at a pedestrian 93.9 MPH. The whiffs on his slider also dropped off a cliff with a 29.8% whiff%. And the control remained well below average. He was bad all season, so it's also not the case of a small blip bringing all the stats down. It seems like Diaz is still the favorite for the job, but I'm not sure why. He shouldn't be at all. Cincy has better options, and I just can't trust that Diaz will actually get the first shot at it. We'll see how he looks in spring, but as of now, I'm too shaky to go after him even as a saves needy team. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.89/1.28/70/15 saves in 65 IP

43) David Robertson - FRA, Closer, 40.0 - Who knows if Robertson can find a closer job this off-season, but even at 40 years old he has the production to find one, and there are more than a few possible landing spots. Going back to Texas seems mighty obvious, and he would close there. He just put up a 3.00 ERA with a 33.3/9.4 K%/BB% in 72 IP. He dominates with a heavily used cutter, which I'm pretty sure he learned from the legend himself, Mariano Rivera. He's 40 and it's hard to value him highly in dynasty regardless, but if I had to guess, I'm guessing he finds a closer job. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.39/1.17/78/25 saves in 65 IP

44) Chris Martin - TEX, Closer, 38.10 - Martin is currently penciled in as the Rangers closer, but let's see where Kenley and Robertson land before feeling too comfortable with that. Even if they don't sign anyone, he doesn't feel all that secure in the role. He's also liable to lose the role by the trade deadline even if he does start the season as the closer. He's the rarer elite control bullpen arm with a 3.45 ERA and 27.8/1.7 K%/BB% in 44.1 IP. The 23.9% whiff% is below average, so I wouldn't buy into that K% too hard. He mostly dominated with a plus cutter that had a 45.5% usage, .260 xwOBA and 27.6% K%. If you wait on closer, beggers can't be choosers, so he's the type of low cost option you will be looking at. And then just cross your fingers he holds the role. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.49/1.14/57/20 saves in 55 IP

45) Jason Adam - SDP, Setup, 33.8 - Suarez showed some cracks in the armor in 2024, and while he's clearly the incoming favorite for the job, Adam seems to be next in line if he falters. Adam is also better than Suarez with a 1.96 ERA and 28.7/8.2 K%/BB% in 73.2 IP. His stuff backs up the production with a plus, bat missing mid 90's fastball to go along with 3 whiff machines secondaries. If San Diego just chooses to go with the best pitcher, and not worry about track record, maybe they do just give the job to Adam. It's worth noting that Jeremiah Estrada is a beast too, but I think track record gives the edge to Adam in the short term if Suarez gets ousted. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.13/1.06/78/10 saves in 65 IP

46) Prelander Berroa - CHW, Closer Committee, 25.0 - Berroa was one of my favorite dynasty closer sleepers last off-season, and while he didn't have exactly the year I hoped for in 2024, it still looks like he could be the best (or at least most fun) option for Chicago. He got an extended look in the majors in August and September, and he showed flashes of greatness with a 3.32 ERA, 2.26 xERA, and 31.3% K% in 19 IP. Not only is he a strikeout machine, but he also induces weak contact with a 84.4 MPH EV. The stuff is classic back of the bullpen stuff with a 97.7 MPH fastball to go along with an elite slider that put up a 43.4% whiff%. The only snafu, and it's a big snafu, is the 15.7% BB%. It sat at 16.1% at Triple-A, so it doesn't look like an aberration. That is just way too high to ignore. I want Berroa to get the job. I think he will get the job. But damn is that walk rate high. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.79/1.33/90/14 saves in 65 IP

47) Taylor Rogers - CIN, Setup, 34.3 - Diaz is as shaky as it gets right now, and Rogers has experience as a closer, saving 31 games in 2022, so it's possible Rogers is the guy if Diaz falters. He's a lefty though, and Cincy has other options even beyond him, so even next man up status is far from certain. Either way, he could be in the mix, and he's coming off a strong season where he put up a 2.40 ERA and 25.9/8.8 K%/BB% in 60 IP. The sinker velocity has been on the decline, sitting at 93 MPH, and the sweeper is a good pitch, but not a great pitch. He seems to be declining, and he's solid, but he's not really great. I think Cincy might go another way even if it's not Diaz, but again, who knows. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.68/1.26/66/9 saves in 60 IP

48) Robert Garcia - TEX, Setup, 28.10 - Garcia is the best lefty in Texas' bullpen, and if they don't sign anyone, Chris Martin seems like a relatively shaky (or more accurately, not locked in) option that possibly could be passed at some point during the season. No guarantee they go to Garcia, but he could start to see more and more save chances regardless. He put up a 2.53 xERA (4.22 ERA) with a 29.9/6.4 K%/BB% in 59.2 IP. He throws 3 good pitches with his changeup being the standout with a .193 xwOBA and 37.2% whiff%. There are ingredients in here for him to breakout, and even as a lefty, maybe he can emerge as the guy. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.56/1.19/75/9 saves in 62 IP

49) Tony Santillan - CIN, Setup, 28.0 - I don't trust Alexis Diaz at all, which makes me more likely to take some shots on Cincy relievers if I wanted to chase saves. Even if Diaz falters, Santillan doesn't even seem like the favorite for next man up, but he's good enough on his own merits to crack this list. He put up a 3.00 ERA with a 37.7/7.4 K%/BB% in 30 IP. He's not that good as the 30% whiff% doesn't back up the K rate, but a 30% whiff% is still damn good. He does it on the back of an elite 97.2 MPH fastball and a plus slider. He saved 16 games at Triple-A before getting the call to the majors, so there is a chance he emerges. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.50/1.25/80/7 saves in 65 IP

50) Luke Weaver - NYY, Setup, 31.7 - The Yanks brought in Devin Williams, which bumps Weaver out of the closer job. He's next man up though, and he's good enough on his own merits to still get a solid ranking. He went full breakout in 2024, putting up a 2.89 ERA with a 31.1/7.9 K%/BB% in 84 IP. The 95.7 MPH fastball was double plus with a +8 run value and 30% whiff%. The changeup was elite with a .216 xwOBA and 48% whiff%. And he throws a solid cutter too. The Yanks saw qualities they thought they could work with when they acquired him in 2023, and boy oh boy did it work with his stuff taking a huge step forward. The move from a starter to the bullpen also probably naturally played a role. Those very real adjustments give hope that this is mostly sustainable, and not a one year blip. We know how volatile relief pitching can be, but I'm apt to buy the breakout. - 2025 Projection 4/3.36/1.11/79/7 saves in 67 IP

51) Blake Treinen - LAD, Closer Committee, 36.9 - The Dodgers are stacking their pen, but Trienen still might be the best one of them all. He put up a 1.93 ERA with a 30.4/6.0 K%/BB% in 46.2 IP. He returned from shoulder surgery and also a lung issues, and while the stuff was down two ticks to 94.6 MPH, it didn't seem to matter at all. The heavily used sweeper is straight filthy with a .163 xwOBA and 49.2% whiff%. He's 36 years old, and there were some signs of decline in 2024, so some caution is warranted, but the guy is lights out. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.99/1.07/70/5 saves in 60 IP

52) Michael Kopech - LAD, Closer Committee, 28.11 - We've been fighting it for years, but Kopech finally took his rightful place in the back of a bullpen, and he thrived with a 3.46 ERA and 31.5/12.2 K%/BB% in 67.2 IP. He was also much better in LA (1.13 ERA in 24 IP) than he was in Chicago (4.74 ERA), because of course he was. He dominates with an elite, heavily used (78.4% usage) 98.7 MPH fastball that is a bat missing machine with a 34% whiff%. The much lesser used slider and cutter aren't nearly as impressive, but the cutter was a new pitch and was pretty good when he went to it with a .235 xwOBA. With LA bringing in Yates and Scott this off-season, it seems to push Kopech out of the pole position for saves. The well below average control and lack of a great secondary also probably pushes him more into a setup role, but I guess he'll still be in the mix. 2025 Projection: 4/3.45/1.20/80/5 saves in 65 IP

53) Jose A. Ferrer - WSH, Setup, 25.1 - Ferrer is the best lefty in an unsettled bullpen situation, which can often lead to like 8-10 saves, and it's very possible he can emerge as the main guy too. He throws gas with a 97.9 MPH sinker that keeps the ball on the ground, he has a plus slider with a 39.6% whiff%, and he has excellent control with a 4.7% BB%. It all led to a 3.38 ERA in 32 IP, but the reason he isn't ranked higher than this, is because he only put up a 19.4% K%. He missed more bats in the minors, and he has the whiff machine secondary, so he's certainly capable of more, but it's hard to count on it as he uses the sinker well over 50% of the time. I'm kinda back and forth on loving Ferrer and thinking he could be the long term closer there vs. seeing the K rates and the fact he's a lefty giving me some caution. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.43/1.11/51/10 saves in 60 IP

54) Tommy Kahnle - DET, Setup, 35.7 - Detroit has a lot of mismatched toys vying for the closer role, and Kahnle is the most traditional of their options. He's struggled to stay on the mound since 2020, not throwing more than 42.2 IP in any of those seasons, but when he's out there, the ERA's have been pristine. He put up a 2.11 ERA with a 25.7/10.6 K%/BB% in 2024. He does it with a heavily used elite changeup and mid 90's heat. If he's healthy, and dealing, he might look the part the most out of any of their options. - 2025 Projection: 2/3.50/1.18/57/7 saves in 50 IP

55) Derek Law - WSH, Closer Committee, 34.7 - If it's not Lopez, maybe Law emerges as the man in Washington. He put up a 2.60 ERA with a 20.8/6.6 K%/BB% in 90 IP. His walk rates have been below average throughout his career, so it's hard to trust that 6.6% BB%, and his K rates have always been below average. The 28.6% whiff% is actually good, and he's always gotten whiffs, but they don't translate to K's. The stuff is good with mid 90's heat, a bat missing slider, and a good cutter, so he very well could end up their most reliable guy. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.78/1.31/54/10 saves in 65 IP

56) Calvin Faucher - MIA, Closer Committee, 29.6 - Faucher was locking in the closer role with 6 saves in August, but he hit the IL with a shoulder problem in September which ended his season, and it allowed Jesus Tinoco get some hooks into the closer role. I have no idea who will be favored for the role in 2025, but Faucher had a 1.40 WHIP with an 11.1% BB%, so I'm kinda feeling Tinoco more. Facuher had a good season with a 3.19 ERA and 26.8% K% in 53.2 IP. None of his pitches are dominant, but the cutter is good, and the sinker and sweeper are solid pitches too. He's just not a good enough reliever to rank him too highly when it's questionable if he even has the role or not. I don't think he's one of my late draft saves targets. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.98/1.34/62/10 saves in 60 IP

57) Adrian Morejon - SDP, Setup, 26.1 - Morejon went through a few iterations as a target for me. Once as a really exciting starting pitcher prospect back in 2018, and once as an exciting bullpen to starter transition candidate back in 2022. And now in 2025, I thought he could be setup to make that transition back to the rotation, but San Diego announced they need him more in the bullpen, so that dream is mostly dead. Who knows what can happen during the season though. Morejon excelled out of the bullpen in 2024 with a 2.83 ERA and 26.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 63.2 IP. The sinker sat 97.4 MPH and put up a negative 6 degree launch. The slider was double plus with a 39.9% whiff%. The 96.9 MPH 4-seamer put up a very good 25% whiff%, and the new split finger was devasting when he went to it with a 52.9% whiff% and .100 xwOBA, but he only went to it 7.6% of time. He pitched well against both lefties and righties. As I mentioned, he came up through the system as a starter, and looking San Diego's rotation, I don't see why they wouldn't at least give it a shot in spring, but it doesn't seem to be in the cards right now. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.40/1.22/75/3 saves in 65 IP

58) Camilo Doval - SFG, Setup, 27.10 - Doval's below average control tanked him in 2024, putting up a 14.4% BB% with a 4.88 ERA in 59 IP, including a mid-season demotion to the minors. The 3.44 xERA was better than the ERA, so bad luck was certainly in play, and he still has fire stuff (99.1 MPH cutter) that misses a ton of bats (34.3% whiff% overall). It wouldn't be surprising at all to see Doval have a big year in 2025, but he's going to have to fight to get the closer job back, and it will probably require an injury and/or implosion by Ryan Walker to even get a chance at it. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.49/1.29/82/5 saves in 65 IP

59) Tyler Holton - DET, Closer Committee, 28.10 - Holton notched 8 saves in 2024 as their main lefty in the pen, and while it seems unlikely for him to ascend to the full time role, you never know. He has a career 2.19 ERA and 0.84 WHIP in 188.2 IP on the back of elite control with a 4.8% BB% in 2024. The fastballs only sit low 90's, but he throws a 5 pitch mix, and the sweeper is a legit bat missing weapon with a 37.9% whiff%. It seems very possible he's Detroit best reliever, so if they don't sign anyone, maybe he can emerge. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.33/0.98/69/10 saves in 80 IP

60) Fraser Allard - CHW, Closer Committee, 27.5 - Chicago's bullpen is an absolute shit show. I have zero clue what is going to happen, but Allard could very well be their best reliever, and despite being a lefty, Chicago might not have any other choice. He put up a 3.75 ERA with a 25.7/11.9 K%/BB% in 24 IP. The 95.1 MPH fastball can miss a respectable amount of bats with a 24.9% whiff%, and the slider was elite with a .133 xwOBA and 41.9% whiff%. The control is below average, so it's not so clear he's any safer than Chicago's other options. If you are chasing saves though, this is an unsettled situation that could pay off if you guess the right guy, and as the top lefty, he could get 10-ish saves regardless. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.95/1.34/69/9 saves in 60 IP

61) Matt Strahm - PHI, Setup, 33.5 - I don't think Strahm is very close to the full time closer role, but he's elite enough to crack this list regardless. He put up a 1.87 ERA with a 33.3/4.6 K%/BB% in 62.2 IP. The 26.7% whiff% shows you probably shouldn't trust that K rate, but he can definitely miss bats with an elite 4-seamer that put up a .229 xwOBA and 26.8% whiff%. The slider is excellent too with a .167 xwOBA and 32.4% whiff%. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.37/1.06/76/3 saves in 63 IP

62) AJ Minter - NYM, Setup, 31.7 - Minter signed a 2 year, $22 million contract with the Mets, which is a good sign the Mets are expecting him healthy coming off hip surgery that ended his 2024 in August. And also coming off a shoulder injury that he returned from mid season with very diminished stuff. I'm not sure I would have given him that contract, but I didn't see the medicals, so what do I know. It also makes it likely he's next man up assuming full health. He was good once again before going down with the injury with a 2.62 ERA and 26.1/8.2 K%/BB% in 34.1 IP, but he wasn't quite as good as his prime. The velocity was down 2 ticks It started down a bit and then just tanked as the season went along, especially after the shoulder injury. The strikeouts also weren't as good as his prime. Even a diminished version of himself can be a good reliever, and unfortunately, I think you have to seriously consider that he could be diminished. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.52/1.17/66/6 saves in 60 IP

63) Robert Stephenson - LAA, Setup, 32.1 - Stephen underwent Tommy John surgery in late April 2024, just a couple months after signing a 3 year deal, which will likely knock him out until mid-season at the earliest. If Ben Joyce is pitching well, I just highly, highly doubt they remove him from the closer job, but if Joyce isn't pitching well, Stephenson could slide in there by the 2nd half, or by 2026. He broke out into the elite tier in 2023 after Tampa unlocked a new cutter, so if he comes back fully healthy, he could definitely make a major impact. Not the worst IL stash, and probably a pretty good one to stash. - 2025 Projection: 1/3.80/1.25/16 in 15 IP

64) Joel Payamps - MIL, Setup, 31.0 - If Megill falters (or gets hurt), I don't think Milwaukee will hesitate to open up the closer role, and Payamps could be the guy who slides in. He nabbed 6 saves in 2024. He's rock solid with a 3.05 ERA and 25.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 59 IP. The 4-seamer misses an elite amount of bats with a 34.5% whiff%, and the slider is average to above average. Nothing flashy, but he's good. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.45/1.14/66/8 saves in 65 IP

65) Chad Green - TOR, Setup, 33.10 - Hoffman failed two medicals before signing with Toronto, so if he gets hurt, it seems Green is next in line after saving 17 games last year. It's not a guarantee though as he has competition for next man up too. His K rate dropped off a cliff in 2024 with a 21.9% K% (23.3% whiff%), but he made up for it with plus control, leading to a 3.21 ERA and 6.7% BB% in 53.1 IP. With the K rate plummeting, and no guarantee he's next man up, I'm not too enticed by him. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.72/1.15/53/6 saves in 55 IP

66) Jose Leclerc - OAK, Setup, 31.4 - Mason Miller has well known injury issues, and it seems Leclerc is next man up in Oakland. He put up a 4.32 ERA with a 30.9/11.1 K%/BB% in 66.2 IP. We know quite well who he is at this point in his career. He's a whiff factory, but the well below average control makes him volatile. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.64/1.26/80/8 saves in 65 IP

67) Beau Brieske - DET, Closer Committee, 27.0 - Brieske was transitioned from a starter to a reliever in 2023, and he started to look mighty comfortable with it in 2024, putting up a 3.59 ERA with a 24.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 67.2 IP. None of his pitches are particularly standout, the 23.9% whiff% is below average, and the control was below average too. At this moment in time, he's more of a solid reliever than a true standout one. Jason Foley is the incumbent, and until the Kenley and Robertson are off the board, I would be scared one of them takes over the role. But Beau cracks this list because if they don't sign anyone, maybe he can sneak in there. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.68/1.28/66/7 saves in 65 IP

68) Justin Slaten - BOS, Setup, 27.7 - Slaten is the young gun in Boston's pen ready to go if the old grandpa's peter out. He has elite control (4% BB%), double plus whiffs (29% whiff%), big velocity (96.4 MPH 4-seamer), and a plus cutter. It resulted in a 2.93 ERA in 55.1 IP. I'm not sure he's the closer of the future, as Boston can keep acquiring vets, but it's certainly possible he does emerge as the long term guy. -2025 Projection: 5/3.38/1.10/70/4 saves in 65 IP

69) Yimi Garcia - TOR, Setup, 34.8 - Hoffman's injury risk makes Toronto an enticing team to take shots on their setup men, and while it seems Green is next in line, Yimi just might be better than him. He put up a 3.46 ERA with a 32/7.8 K%/BB% in 39 IP. The 96.5 MPH 4-seamer was elite with a .256 xwOBA and 31.7% whiff%, and he throws a 6 pitch mix with the curve, sweeper and changeup capable of missing bats. His season ended in August with an elbow injury, so he also has injury risk, and it feels like a lot has to happen for him to end up the closer. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.65/1.14/75/5 saves in 60 IP

70) Evan Phillips - LAD, Setup, 30.7 - LA has nine million guys, and it seems like Phillips is on the outs, but he's racked up 42 saves over the last 2 years, so I guess I'll put him on this list. He took a step back in 2024 with a 3.62 ERA and 27.6/7.5 K%/BB% in 54.2 IP, but the stuff is still good, and we know relievers can have wonky years. He cracks this list more for track record than his current path to saves. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.40/1.15/70/5 saves in 60 IP

71) Ryan Zeferjahn - LAA, Setup, 27.1 - If Joyce falters, Zeferjahn could be the next best righty option in LA's pen. He put up a 2.21 ERA with a 28.1/9.4 K%/BB% in 17 IP. His three pitch mix was straight elite with a 97.3 MPH 4-seamer that put up a 37.1% whiff%, a cutter that put up a .224 xwOBA, and a sweeper that put up a .153 xwOBA. He was good at Triple-A too. Obviously it's a small sample and he hasn't been all that great in his career up until this year, but relievers pop up like this all the time, and he clearly has the stuff. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.74/1.25/66/4 saves in 60 IP

72) Dedniel Nunez - NYM, Setup, 28.10 - Nunez' season ended in August with a forearm injury, and Roster Resource doesn't even have him making the team, but his profile is too bulletproof not to get excited by him. Minter is getting long in the tooth a bit, and Nunez could very easily end up the clearly 2nd best option in their bullpen. He put up a 2.31 ERA with a 35.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 35 IP. The slider was elite with a 45.3% whiff% and .189 xwOBA, and the 96.3 MPH fastball put up a respectable 25.2% whiff%. He was dominant at Triple-A too before getting the call, and while there have been some bouts of wildness, he's had generally solid control on the whole. This is just a case of betting on the talent and letting the chips fall where they may. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.30/1.16/80/0 saves in 60 IP

73) Michell Otanez - OAK, Setup, 27.9 - Otanez probably isn't next in line to the closer job, but he's too fire to keep off the list. He put up a 2.49 xERA, 3.44 ERA, and a 36.4/13.2 K%/BB% in 34 IP. The 98 MPH fastball is an insane bat massing machine with a 39.2% whiff%, and so is the slider with a 52.2% whiff%. The control is horrible, and he's had high ERA's in the minors, so he's still just an upside play on the back of the list. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.72/1.32/90/0 saves in 61 IP

74) Emilio Pagan - CIN, Setup, 33.11 - Cincy is a good spot to save chase, and while they have a lot of options if Diaz loses the job, Pagan will be one of them. He wasn't that good in 2024 with a 4.50 ERA and 27.8/7.0 K%/BB%, but everything more or less looks to be within career norms (career 3.78 ERA). He has the best combo of being a righty and strong track record out of the non Diaz options. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.90/1.28/65/5 saves in 60 IP

75) Gus Varland - CHW, Closer Committee, 28.5 - Varland doesn't have the whiff rates of Chicago's other options with a 24.5% whiff%, but he has the control edge with a 7% BB%, and maybe that ends up winning the day considering the volatility of the other options. He was solid in 2024 with a 3.42 ERA and 23.5% K% in 26.1 IP. Maybe he ends up the guy. Who knows. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.10/1.33/65/2 saves in 65 IP

76) Pierce Johnson - ATL, Setup, 33.11 - Johnson is likely next man up in Atlanta, and while he's not great, he has the strikeout upside to crack the list. He put up a 3.67 ERA with a 28.4/10.6 K%/BB% in 56.1 IP. He does it with an above average fastball/slider combo. If Atlanta had other better options, I might not have put him on, but they don't seem to right now. Maybe Hurston Waldrep emerges as their closer of the future though. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.88/1.32/72/6 saves in 60 IP
