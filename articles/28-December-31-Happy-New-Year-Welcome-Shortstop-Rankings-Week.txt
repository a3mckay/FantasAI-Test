Happy New Year and Welcome to Shortstop Rankings Week!

It's fitting that the rankings of the Golden Children of the baseball world, shortstops, fall on the hyped up New Year's Eve. Both get juiced up in the rankings, and while they can often end up underwhelming, when they hit, they hit big. I'm going probably like 130+ deep with the first post dropping tomorrow. Stay safe tonight, or don't, but either way, I'll catch you on the flip side ...
