Top 98 Second Baseman: 2025 Positional Dynasty Baseball Rankings

New
Dec 20, 2024

Second Base is position closest to my heart, as that was the position I mostly played growing up. And please stop just displacing and undervaluing natural 2B with bad defenders from other positions thinking it's easy! Get off my position! You stunk at SS and now you also stink at 2B! And while we're at it, I can also play a better SS than you if the damn coach gave me chance! And one more thi ... okay, I let that get away from me for a second there ;) But back on track, let's show these slick fielding middle infielders the love they deserve. Here is the Top 98 Second Baseman: 2025 Positional Dynasty Baseball Rankings:

*Tyler Fitzgerald was inserted into these rankings at #32 despite not yet having 2B eligibility (I use a 20 game cutoff), but I made an exception because he's expected to be their starting 2B

1) Mookie Betts - LAD, 2B/OF, 32.6 - Betts is the leader of the Slow Bat Speed Kings with a 69 MPH swing that is 442nd "best" in baseball (minimum 50 swings). But he proves swinging an electric bat isn't the only path to success. He had another great season which was only interrupted by a fractured hand in mid June, slashing .289/.372/.491 with 19 homers, 16 steals, and a 11.0/11.8 K%/BB% in 116 games. The 11% K% tied a career best, and his 16 steals tied for a 6 year best. The 26.7 ft/sec sprint was a career low and in the bottom 30% of the league, so while there certainly seems to be some physical decline, it hasn't impacted his stats quite yet. Like I've been saying with elite players like this, 33 years old is when I start to think about selling, so I'm running it back in 2025 with Mookie. - 2025 Projection: 110/32/100/.290/.370/.525/18

2) Jackson Holliday - BAL, 2B, 21.4 - There always has to be one. Chourio was a beast. Langford was really good and beasted at the end of the season. Merrill exceeded all expectations all year. Caminero showed flashes and laid a solid foundation. And then there was Holliday, who had a nightmare rookie year. He slashed .189/.255/.311 with 5 homers, 4 steals, and a 33.2/7.2 K%/BB% in 60 games. The .262 xwOBA backs up the terrible surface stats. To continue with the bad, just to get it all out of my system, his bat speed also wasn't very impressive with a 71.2 MPH swing that was very slightly below average. There are very real things to be concerned about, like the hit tool being bottom of the scale bad, because he doesn't necessarily have the biggest game power/base stealing to truly make up for that. It's possible for prospects to bust, or have decent but unspectacular careers, even elite ones who feel can't miss. Now having said that, I'm not even close to giving up on Holliday. Even with the extreme struggles, he put up a very good 8.2% Barrel% and 89.3/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV. Hitting the ball that hard as a 20 year old is impressive. He's also lightning fast with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint, and he had an above average 27.2% Chase%, so it's not like he was completely lost up there. His hit tool has been very strong at every stop of the minors, so a 33.9% whiff% as a 20 year old in his first taste of the majors really isn't that huge of a deal. It's almost certain to improve as he gains experience. Do I think his terrible season has his stock dropping a bit? Yes. But he's still a Top 50 dynasty asset for me, and I'm expecting a much better year 2. - 2025 Projection: 77/16/68/.247/.318/.411/18 Prime Projection: 98/25/83/.278/.360/.485/25

3) Ketel Marte - ARI, 2B, 31.6 - Marte has always hit the ball hard, but he went absolutely bonkos in 2024 with a 94 MPH EV which was a career high by a mile (91.1 MPH in 2023). It was the 6th best EV in baseball amongst qualified hitters. And it resulted in him smashing 36 homers in 136 games to go along with his usual excellent plate plate approach (18.2/11.1 K%/BB%) and high BA (.292). His righty swing is just an insane 77.2 MPH, and it resulted in a 1.080 OPS vs. lefties. His 71.5 MPH lefty swing is just fine too and it resulted in a .841 OPS. I have to say, the jump in EV is suspiciously high, but what do I know. It sure feels like a career year, but if the throwback steroid era 30 year old power breakout is for real, maybe he can hold this level for the next couple years. I find it hard to bet on that, but even if he falls back to career norms, he's still a damn good hitter. - 2025 Projection: 97/29/90/.280/.357/.506/8

4) Ozzie Albies - ATL, 2B, 28.3 - I'm a little torn on Albies. On the one hand, Albies is still in the prime of his career, and has a long track of excellent production, which makes predicting a bounce back season in 2025 seem very easy. But on the other hand, his 27.2 ft/sec sprint speed was a career low and was below average, he swings a well below average bat with a 69.1 MPH swing, and he chases a lot with a 33.6% Chase%. He also doesn't hit the ball hard enough (32% Hard Hit% in 2024 and 35.5% in his career) to make up for a lot of those deficiencies. He thrives based on the contact (14.9% K%), lift (18.4 degree launch), and pull (48.8% Pull%) profile, but I'm starting to question if this is a profile I want to bet on long term. The profile isn't that much different than Jose Altuve, who has aged just fine, so maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm starting to think that Albies might have more name value than real dynasty value at the moment. I'm not too concerned over the next couple of seasons, but in the medium and long term, I wouldn't be surprised to see him as just a good fantasy player, rather than a true difference maker. - 2025 Projection: 83/25/87/.266/.321/.461/16

5) Matt McLain - CIN, 2B/SS, 25.8 - Don't forget about little Matty Mclain. He underwent shoulder surgery in late March and then suffered a late season rib injury which knocked out his entire regular season. But he returned in time for the AFL to prove his shoulder was healthy, and he hit well there with 4 homers and a .876 OPS in 13 games. It gives confidence that with a full normal off-season, he will be ready to build on his awesome 2023 MLB debut where he slashed .290/.357/.507 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in 89 games. He obliterated Triple-A too with a 184 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint and he has above average power with a 89.3 MPH EV and 13.8 degree launch. His plate approach wasn’t great with a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in the majors, but his chase rate was above average at 25.4%, and his 28% whiff% shows he isn’t going to have any major contact issues. He also had a 20.6%/16.7% K%/BB% in the minors. And the cherry on top is that he is a good defensive player, so his glove will keep him on the field. Assuming full health, McLain is the real deal, but factoring in some rust and/or risk from the surgery wouldn't be crazy. Just don't factor in too much, because McLain can be a really exciting fantasy player. - 2025 Projection: 82/25/79/.269/.343/.468/22

6) Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.9 - Campbell possesses one of the most visually disgusting swings I have ever seen, and I mean that in the best way possible. It looks like he literally unhinges his shoulder to turn his body into a cannon, absolutely unfurling on the baseball. Here is what I wrote about a homer Campbell hit in early September in the in-season Dynasty Baseball Rundowns: "on his latest homer, I think he dislocated his shoulder with one of the most bad intentions swings I've seen."  Underscoring my visual evaluation of that explosive shoulder movement is that shortly after that homer he hit the IL with a lat strain, which is right under the shoulder blades. Campbell underwent a well documented swing change and bat speed training to unlock more power last off-season, which was obviously successful beyond anybody's wildest imagination, so let's just hope that it's not going to cause more injuries. That is the only small thing that is even rattling around in my brain as a negative, because the season he just had was nothing short of spectacular. He slashed .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers, 24 steals, and a 19.9/14.3 K%/BB% in 115 games spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He was just as dominant in the upper minors as he was at High-A with across the board domination. He hits it hard, he has a good feel to hit, he has a good approach, he has size (6'3'', 191 pounds), he has bat speed, he can lift it, and he has speed. You can be hesitant to fully buy in because it feels like he came out of nowhere, but he put up a 1.033 OPS in 45 games in the ACC in 2023, a .932 OPS in 58 games in 2022 in the Northwoods League, and then a .911 OPS in 22 games at mostly High-A in his pro debut, so it's not his fault that everyone underrated him. He always had a good feel to hit and good approach, and he always had the frame and athleticism to tack on more power, so I'm not going to hold it against him that he wasn't more hyped (4th round pick in 2023). He still didn't lift and pull the ball a ton with an under 40% Pull% and under 30% FB%, but he knew when to pick his spots (as you saw with that homer video above), and he has the type of profile that can thrive without an extreme lift and pull profile. I'm all in on Campbell. He's an elite prospect who has a chance to break camp in the bigs. - 2025 Projection: 68/16/61/.252/.324/.423/19 Prime Projection: 98/26/89/.277/.356/.478/26

7) Matt Shaw - CHC, 3B/2B/SS, 23.4 - The little man discount never fails. Baseball scouts see a little man, and they immediately shave a few inches of projection right off the top. I don't mind it, because it consistently creates excellent buying opportunities for the right players (see the Dynasty Strategy Section in the Cubs Team Report for more thoughts on this), and Matt Shaw is definitely one of those right players. He went a little later than he should have in the real MLB Draft, then he went a little later than he should have in Dynasty First Year Player Drafts, and now he's getting ranked a little later than he should be on prospect lists. He's an elite prospect that gets ranked like a merely good one. He might only be 5'9'', but his bat packs a true punch, putting up an 89.3 MPH EV with a 14.6 degree launch in 35 games at Triple-A. He smoked 21 homers on the season in 121 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. He's not a pull machine, but a lot of these lift and pull machines put up some pretty low batting averages, and a profile like Shaw doesn't need to only pull the ball. He can use his hard hit ability, plus speed (31 steals), and plus contact rates (18.2% K%) to do damage when he goes oppo. He also walks a ton with a 11.9% BB%, making him a likely top of the order bat. Don't fall into the little man trap, Shaw is going to be a do everything fantasy terror when he gets his shot, and with the Paredes/Cam Smith trade, that shot could come on Opening Day. Shaw's been a target for me from before his junior year of college, and he remains a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 66/16/71/.256/.318/.419/19 Prime Projection: 96/23/83/.276/.348/.461/26

8) Jose Altuve - HOU, 2B, 34.11 - It seems as if we can finally say that Altuve is in the decline phase of his career with a career worst .316 xwOBA (not including the shortened 2020 season). His 22.1% whiff% and 37.3% Chase% were both career worsts by a decent margin. His 27.1 ft/sec sprint is way down from his prime (28.6 ft/sec in his prime). But even in a decline phase Altuve went .295/20/22. He could always pull it, but his 55.6% Pull% was a career high, so we know Altuve is going to continue to aim for the fences even in decline, and even with declining speed he can still steal bags, even though he also got caught 7 times. Like Freeman, I would say now is definitely the time to pull the trigger on an Altuve trade, even in win now mode. Any more signs of decline, or a down year, will absolutely tank his dynasty trade value. It's better to be a year early, than a year late. - 2025 Projection: 96/24/69/.286/.348/.465/18

9) Jordan Westburg - BAL, 2B/3B, 26.1 - I've been saying that Mark Vientos was my best target call of 2024, but Westburg isn't far behind. I closed out his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "That is a pretty Teflon combination of skills to have. While Gunnar and Adley hog all the attention on the MLB level, and Holliday, Mayo, Basallo etc … hog all the attention on prospect lists, you should sneakily tip toe in there and steal Westburg from his current owner like a thief in the night." ... that teflon combination of skills I was talking about showed back up in 2024, and this time it unsurprisingly resulted in an excellent season with 18 homers, 6 steals, a 21.7% K% and 125 wRC+ in 107 games (he missed almost two months with a fractured hand but returned before the end of the season). He smokes the ball with a 11.8% Barrel%, 91.1/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch and 46.1% Hard Hit%. He has plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint, he gets the bat on the ball with a 21.7% K%, and he's an above average defender at 3B. The 4.9% BB% was low, but he doesn't have any major chase issues, so I'm not too concerned about that. Like Cowser, I don't love that he was only 6 for 9 on the bases. As much as I like the bat, that base stealing element is big to put the profile over the top, and it seems we can't really count on that. It prevents him from truly blowing up, but it doesn't prevent him from being a Top 100 dynasty asset. - 2025 Projection: 79/26/87/.269/.325/.473/9

10) Travis Bazzana - CLE, 2B, 22.7 - Selected 1st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bazzana looks like a tightly wound ball of kinetic energy that is just ready to explode in the box (I think ball of "Potential" energy is actually the correct scientific term, but I felt like "Kinetic" just hit harder :) ... There is toe tapping and bat wiggling before he absolutely uncoils on the baseball, jacking 28 homers in 60 games in the Pac 12 this year, and also smoking 6 homers with a 1.037 OPS in the wood bat cape cod league in 2023. He's "only" 6 feet tall, but there is easy plus power in here at the least. He combines the plus power with a near elite plate approach/hit tool (12.5%/25.7% K%/BB%), and speed (16 steals). He didn't standout in his pro debut, but he did enough to feel confident about him fulfilling his upside with 3 homers, 5 steals, a 126 wRC+ and 25.4/13.9 K%/BB% in 27 games at High-A. He's the total offensive package, and there is a reason he got taken #1 overall by a very smart franchise despite limited defensive value. The only thing that can stop him seems to be his parents. His parents almost ended his career before it started when celebrating. His dad tried to rip his arm out of his socket, and then his mom put him in some kind of neck hold into a tripping maneuver. Travis almost looked like he was about to square up with his mom for a second there. I guess they do things differently Down Under in Australia. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/31/.247/.319/.420/8 Prime Projection: 93/24/86/.275/.352/.466/25

11) JJ Wetherholt - STL, 2B, 22.7 - Selected 7th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Wetherholt might not have quite the ceiling of Bazzana, but even that is highly debatable, and he's establishing that he most probably has the floor edge with a 11.9% K% at Single-A vs. Bazzana's 25.4% K% at High-A. Different levels, but that is a pretty stark difference. He hit the ball on the ground a lot more than Bazzana, which is where some of that upside edge comes in, but he did it with a 91.9 MPH EV, so don't cap his power upside too much. He's two inches smaller than Bazzana at 5'10'', but he rocks that little man leg kick that I've always loved, and always seems to get the most out of smaller guys raw power. He slid in the draft a bit after getting a lot of #1 overall buzz, likely due to missing about half of the season with a hamstring injury and still not being fully healthy when he returned. It was his 2nd major hamstring injury within the year. His 16 homer pace was also not that impressive when everyone else was hitting like 30+. What he does better than maybe anyone else in the draft though is hit. He put up a 10.4%/18.3% K%/BB% in 2024 and had a 8.2% K% in 2023. He's a complete hitter who uses the entire field with a quick and simple lefty swing. Tack on plus speed (57 steals in 145 career games), and you have a damn enticing fantasy player even if his power upside doesn't quite match some of the other bats in the class. I have Bazzana ranked over him, but I don't think it's some no brainer decision. JJ is right there. - 2025 Projection: 18/3/16/.259/.321/.401/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/78/.289/.357/.449/23

12) Zack Gelof - OAK, 2B, 25.5 - When I named Gelof a major target back in 2023 at the very beginning of his breakout, I dubbed myself the "Autobahn of Dynasty Baseball Schools," and if you think scraping up against the guard rails a little bit in 2024 is going to scare me off, you got another thing coming. I'm scooping up all of the depressed Gelof shares I can. The theme of "Oakland" hitters is going to be the huge ballpark upgrade that is coming for them, and Gelof is no exception with a .536 OPS at home vs. a .724 OPS on the road. Unfortunately, the ballpark isn't really Gelof's major concern, it's the hit tool, and there is no doubt that it is rough with a 34.4% K% and 36.4% whiff%, but the sophomore slump is very real after teams get an entire off-season to plan against you, and now it's Gelof's turn to make the proper adjustments to turn the tables again. I'm betting on him being able to do it well enough to allow his damn exciting power/speed combo to shine with a 89.2 MPH EV, 14.2 degree launch, and 28.7 ft/sec sprint. He went 17/25 in 138 games despite the .211 BA and .270 OBP. There is definitely a ton of risk that the hit tool doesn't bounce back, but if it does, he'll go 20/30 in his sleep. With his price in the toilet right now, that is worth the risk. - 2025 Projection: 77/23/75/.238/.313/.436/29

13) Colt Keith - DET, 2B, 23.8 - Keith's rookie year was so average across the board it almost makes it not average because of how average it was. It was uniquely average. He had an about average 97 wRC+ with an about average .313 xwOBA, an about average 23.2% whiff%, an about average 29.9% Chase%, and an about average 71.3 MPH swing.. Really all of his numbers are in that average range, slashing .260/.309/.380 with 13 homers, 7 steals, and a 19.8/6.5 K%/BB% in 148 games. His 87.8 MPH EV was a bit below average and his 27.7 ft/sec sprint was a bit above average. For a 22 year old, that is almost the textbook definition of "setting a solid foundation." He's right on track to be an at least above average MLB hitter, and there is ceiling for him to possibly become one of the better all around hitters in the game if he can take that same developmental path as Riley Greene did. - 2025 Projection: 72/19/76/.265/.324/.430/7 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.278/.342/.476/9

14) Christian Moore - LAA, 2B, 21.10 - Selected 8th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the Angels don't fuck around when it comes to promoting advanced college hitters to the majors, so you know Moore is going to be a contributor on your fantasy team real quick, possibly as soon as Opening Day. Shit, he almost made his MLB debut in 2024 with his absolute destruction of pro ball, slashing .322/.378/.533 with 5 homers, 2 steals, and a 29.6/8.2 K%/BB% in 23 games at Double-A. A knee injury (meniscus) is likely the only thing that stopped that from happening, but he returned to Double-A before the season ended and went 3 for 4 with a double and 4 RBI, so I wouldn't be worried about the knee. I fell in love with his personality during his Draft Day interview. It was the perfect mix of confident, cocky, thoughtful, playful and mature. That just seems like the type of infectious attitude I want on my team. He wasn't kidding when he said he had Champion in his blood. And of course, he was an absolute beast in the SEC, smashing 34 homers with a 1.248 OPS and 14.5%/11.3% K%/BB% in 72 games. He has a very strong righty swing at 6'1'', 210 pounds, producing at least plus power with average speed on the bases. In his freshman year in 2022, he put up a 1.062 OPS with 10 homers in 149 PA to give you an idea of the type of natural talent this is. As you saw with his K rate at Double-A, there are definitely some hit tool issues, which I'm not ignoring, but I'm also not letting it scare me off. I was high on Moore before his pro debut, and now I am over the moon for him. He ranked 4th overall on my End of Season Top 56 FYPD Rankings. - 2025 Projection: 70/23/77/.242/.310/.437/8 Prime Projection: 85/28/94/.260/.335/.481/10

15) Marcus Semien - TEX, 2B 34.7 - Semien is one of the top examples of a player with a slow bat still being able to thrive. There really aren't a ton of these examples, and even Semien's power has been all over the map throughout his career, ranging from the mid teens to the mid 40's. He has a double below average 68.3 MPH swing, and while maybe it got even slower this year due to aging, he's clearly always swung a slow bat, so I'm not blaming that on the down year (99 wRC+). All of the underlying numbers are more or less in line with career norms, so I do genuinely think it was just a down year, and not the start of a decline. Now having said that, the true start of the decline could easily come next year in his age 34 year old season, so you have to factor that into his dynasty value. He also stole only 8 bags in 159 games. If we can't count on steals, his career .255 BA, and variable power, might not really be able to make up for it. He's still a good win now player, but I think his name value is still higher than his true value in a dynasty league. I'm not looking to buy the decline years here. - 2025 Projection: 91/25/79/.250/.321/.450/12

16) Nico Hoerner - CHC, 2B, 27.11 - Hoerner is a super simple evaluation as an elite contact/speed/defense play with a 10.3% K% and 31 steals in 151 games. He graded out as the 3rd best defensive 2B in baseball behind only Marcus Semien and Andres Gimenez. There isn't much power here and there isn't much coming either with a 1.2% Barrel% (that is 6 total barrels all season), leading to only 7 homers. The Paredes/Cam Smith trade seems to take some of the trade heat off Hoerner for now pending future moves, but he's a starter no matter where he lands. - 2025 Projection: 90/9/55/.280/.339/.389/31

17) Bryson Stott - PHI, 2B, 27.6 - I always thought Stott had the possibility of another level of power to unleash considering his size (6'3'', 200 pounds), and decent EV data (88.1 MPH in 2023), but now seeing his double below average 68.2 MPH swing, I realize that it wasn't actually a very good possibility. I know I've said it in a ton of player blurbs already, but this new bat speed data is so awesome to have. If the bat speed data didn't tell me that more power wasn't coming, his 2024 numbers would have told me anyway with his EV hitting a career low 87 MPH, leading to only 11 homers in 148 games. The contact was still excellent (16.3% K%), the speed was on point (32 steals with a 29.1 ft/sec sprint), and the 9.3% BB% was a career best. I'm no longer holding out hope for a breakout (although you still never know), but his contact/speed profile is still enticing. - 2025 Projection: 79/15/65/.268/.327/.407/31

18) Xander Bogaerts - SDP, 2B/SS, 32.6 - Bogaerts put up a .581 OPS in his first 47 games before hitting the IL with a fractured shoulder. He's been such a lukewarm fantasy player for a little while now, and at already 31 years old, I was just about ready to put the dagger in his fantasy value, but he returned a new man not even 2 months later. He closed out the season slashing .299/.338/.432 with 7 homers, 9 steals, and a 14.8/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 64 games. It's still not a profile I'm looking to buy into as he gets deeper into his 30's, but he clearly proved the shoulder injury wasn't as bad as it sounded. He should have a few more seasons of solid across the board production left in him. - 2025 Projection; 80/17/67/.278/.343/.429/17

19) Brice Turang - MIL, 2B, 25.5 - Turang stole 50 bags in 2024, which was 3rd in all of baseball behind only Elly and Shohei. Unfortunately, that is all he does with a 2.4% Barrel%, .254 BA (.261 xBA),.665 OPS, and .297 xwOBA. He's a bottom of the order guy, but his plate skills are pretty good (17.0/8.1 K%/BB%), and he walked a lot in the minors, so his path to improvement is putting up a good enough BA/OBP to hit at the top of the order. He's a good defensive 2B and a good SS too, so his glove should keep him on the field. - 2025 Projection: 76/9/55/.263/.322/.379/41

20) Gleyber Torres - FRA, 2B, 28.4 - Gleyber had a very easy to identify down season. They happen. He was 27 in a contract year and the individual components of the underlying numbers were all in line with career norms. I don't think he just fell off out of nowhere. Plus, the hot streak did finally come at the end of the season with a .861 OPS in his final 35 games. He's an easy bet to bounce back, assuming he doesn't land in the offensive vacuum that is Seattle (or SF). The biggest issue for fantasy is that he isn't a good base stealer, he's slow, and he stole only 4 bags last year, so we aren't really talking about big upside here. He's more of a solid bat. Where he lands could swing his value a bit in either direction. - 2025 Projection: 84/23/72/.265/.338/.444/8

21) Andres Gimenez - TOR, 2B, 26.7 - The power uptick just isn't coming for Gimenez with it actually going in the opposite direction in 2024 with a career worst 2.8% Barrel%. It led to just 9 homers in 152 games. You can tell Cleveland gave up on it too, trading him for essentially rotation depth (and some upside in Ortiz). He's also a bottom of the order hitter with a 4.1% BB%. He's one of the best defensive 2B in baseball, so the glove will keep him on the field, and the contact/speed profile is legit with a 15.3% K% and 30 steals. You can never say never when it comes to power upticks in your mid to late 20's, but the indicators just aren't there to bet on it. - 2025 Projection: 73/14/65/.262/.321/.396/30

22) Maikel Garcia - KCR, 3B/2B, 25.1 - Garcia was a major target for me last off-season, and while he didn't have the game power breakout I thought was possible, and despite being very unlucky, he still finished 115th overall on the Razzball Player Rater, which is better than I expected considering the disappointing season. His 37 steals were the 7th most in baseball, and he only got caught 2 times. He hit only .231, but with a 16.5% K% and 90.4 MPH EV, that is so clearly the result of bad luck (.260 xBA). He didn't make any attempts to unlock more game power with a low launch and low pull rate, so that just might not be an adjustment he's interested in making. He's entering his mid 20's, and I do still think a game power uptick is possible, but it's hard to count on it. He's an above average defensive player at 3B and he doesn't have much competition for the job, so all indications are that KC is going to run it back with Garcia in 2025, but it's likely to come at the bottom of the order this year, especially after the India trade. I can't say he's a major target for me this off-season, and while I lean calling him a miss, maybe a neutral is more accurate. He's settling in as a contact/speed play, but the high EV gives him just enough of an upside boost to stay interesting. - 2025 Projection: 76/10/64/.266/.320/.382/29

23) Kevin McGonigle - DET, SS/2B, 20.7 - McGonigle had one of the best hit tools in the high school class, and while this is generally a bucket of prospect that I don't go after in first year player drafts, McGonigle showed what it looks like when that profile goes right. He slashed .309/.401/.452 with 5 homers, 22 steals, and a 8.5/14.0 K%/BB% in 74 games split between Single-A and High-A. He proved he wasn't just hit tool though, hitting the ball pretty hard with a 88.9 MPH EV at Single-A, and also showing base stealing skills (22 for 24 on the bases). He didn't have any groundball issues and he pulled the ball a lot (well over 50% pull rate). Even during the regular season I got too locked into him as a hit tool guy, when there is more to his skillset than that. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10", 187 pounds, and I still see more of a moderate power/speed combo, so I still don't mind my Stevan Kwan 2.0 comp, but McGonigle is already hitting the ball harder (and pulling the ball a lot more), so he can end up a souped up version of Kwan. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 92/15/58/.291/.362/.422/21

24) Termarr Johnson - PIT, 2B, 20.10 - It only took 23 games in Johnson's 2022 pro debut to realize that his hit tool was overrated coming out the draft, and that started to scare people off in 2023 and 2024 when that became even more glaringly obvious with a .244 BA and .237 BA in those respective years. But Johnson was never just a hit tool only guy, he has real power and speed, so while the hit tool troubles prevent him from rising to near elite prospect status as hoped, it doesn't prevent him from still being a really exciting prospect. He swings an electric and powerful lefty bat that hits the ball really hard, resulting in 15 homers in 124 games, and his speed has always been a bit undersold, nabbing 22 bags. The hit tool isn't as good as hoped, but the 21.3% K% isn't bad at all, and he put up a 19.3% in 14 games when he got the call to Double-A as a 20 year old, which is exciting to see. He's also an on base machine with a 15.6% BB%. With him falling out of favor in the mainstream, now is a really good opportunity to buy low if you can, because when he produces in the upper minors as a still 20 year old, the hype is going to hit all over again. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/23/78/.262/.343/.452/15

25) Luis Garcia - WAS, 2B, 24.11 - I see why one would buy into Luis Garcia. He was a talented prospect who got rushed to the majors and just had his big breakout season at 24 years old. That checks out. But personally, I'm not buying in. He hit a career high 18 homers in 140 games, but with a 47.4% GB% and 30.4% Pull%, that looks like the top of his ability, rather than some true upward trajectory. He stole a career high by far 22 bags (9 was his previous career high), but with a below average 27.2 ft/sec sprint, it seems shaky to really count on a follow up on that. And while the hit tool is good, a 21.3% whiff% is only above average, and a 36% Chase% is terrible, so the plate approach still isn't good. The final nail in the coffin is that he was already regressing by the end of the season with a .250 BA, 4 homers, and 3 steals (in 5 attempts) in his final 39 games. I kinda hesitate to call a 25 year old breakout a sell, because I generally don't play the game like that, but I would be all ears on Garcia this off-season if I can get a similarly objectively valued young breakout who I actually believe in more. - 2025 Projection: 69/16/76/.276/.312/.420/16

26) Brandon Lowe - TBR, 2B, 30.9 - If Lowe could stay healthy and actually play a full season, he could put up some pretty impressive numbers, but he's only stayed healthy twice in his career. Once in the shortened 2020 season where he hit 14 homers in 56 games, and then again in 2021 where he hit 39 homers in 149 games. Sure those homer totals are the top end of his ability, but he's been putting up impressive xwOBA's his entire career, including a .346 xwOBA in 2024. The 12.4% Barrel% is excellent, and the 94.1 MPH FB EV and 14.5 degree launch backs that up. He was also really good against lefties last year (.835 OPS in 72 PA) and he hasn't been that bad against them in his career (.737 OPS), so I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that he gets platooned depending on how good Tampa's other options are playing. If you want to roll the dice on his health, there could be a big power payoff. - 2025 Projection: 74/26/79/.241/.319/.471/6

27) Luisangel Acuna - NYM, SS/2B/OF, 23.1 - Acuna was in the midst of an extremely lackluster season at Triple-A with a 69 wRC+ in 131 games, but maybe he was just getting bored, because he gave his dynasty value a shot to the arm in his cup of coffee in the bigs. He jacked out 3 homers with a 91 MPH EV, 15% K% and 165 wRC+ in 40 PA. He might not be as good as his older brother, but the electric Acuna blood most certainly runs through his veins with a near elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed and a plus 73.5 MPH bat speed. He's only 5'10'', and the 87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A wasn't as impressive, but there is real juice in his bat, especially as he continues to get stronger. He's a game changer on the bases with 40 steals at Triple-A, and he's put up strong contact rates at every level, including the majors. He only had a 2.5% BB% in the majors, but he really didn't chase a concerning amount with a 30.8% Chase%. He can play SS, 2B, and CF, which means he can basically play any position on the field, so that versality will keep his bat in the lineup if he's producing. He looks like a mighty enticing dynasty asset right now, and the cherry on top is that he's destroying Venezuela Winter Ball right now, slashing .337/.419/.495 with 3 homers, 18 steals, and a 18/11 K/BB in 32 games. - 2025 Projection: 73/12/61/.256/.309/.394/23 Prime Projection: 84/16/69/.272/.328/.426/30

28) Luis Arraez - SDP, 1B/2B, 28.0 - If you've read me for any length of time, you know that Arraez just isn't the type of fantasy player I go after. He's a special contact hitter with an absurd 4.3% K%, which was a career best this year, and he has a career .323 BA, but the power/speed combo is just super lackluster. 4 homers with 9 steals in 150 games just isn't worth the BA bump, and neither are the 129 combined Runs and RBI. He always gets valued considerably higher than I would be willing to take him, so I never end up with him on my teams. - 2025 Projection: 84/8/51/.318/.357/.420/8

29) Christopher Morel - TBR, 3B/2B, 25.9 - I'm happy I didn't know about Morel's very elite 76.1 MPH swing before this year, because I might have ended up even higher on him than I already was, and it's a reminder to not overrate bat speed, even though I do think it is a majorly valuable stat to have. Despite the elite bat speed, Morel bottomed out in 2024 with a 82 wRC+ and .196 BA in 152 games. The interesting thing is that his plate approach actually took the step forward we wanted to see with a 26.0/10.0 K%/BB% (31.0/8.4 K%/BB% in 2023), and in theory, it should have resulted in a big year. Clearly the .233 BABIP (career .277 BABIP) played a big role, but he also hit a relatively lackluster 21 homers. He got unlucky, but he also wasn't that good even with neutral luck with a .316 xwOBA (.280 wOBA). And finally he got considerably slower with a 27.3 ft/sec sprint (28.6 in 2023), which could be an indicator he was playing through an injury (he hurt his foot earlier in the year). It's still very easy to make a case to buy Morel, which is the case I made a few years ago, and those skills are still present. Namely, he hits the ball very hard. A full off-season with Tampa going into his age 25/26 year old season could easily result in a big season. Most people seem to have lost hope, and while I wouldn't call him a target, I think I want to go one more year to see what he can do. He's a let him come to you buy for a cheap price only. - 2025 Projection: 68/25/77/.235/.316/.438/10

30) Jonathan India - KCR, 2B, 28.4 - India goes from one of the best offensive power ballparks in baseball to one of the worst, and I gotta say, I'm not sure I want anything to do with this. His power is not the type that can thrive in any ballpark with a 87.2/91.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, and he hits the ball in the air a fair amount with a 13.5 degree launch. He had a career .809 OPS at home vs. a .722 OPS on the road. His 19.6% K% is good, but it's not great, and he's not a huge base stealer with 13 steals in 151 games. While KC is not a good ballpark for power, they are an above average park for righties overall, so India's value might not tank, but power is king for fantasy, and it's a clear downgrade for me. The upside wasn't high to begin with, and now the floor is getting considerably lower with the ballpark switch. I'm passing on India this year. - 2025 Projection: 82/14/58/.252/.343/.402/14

31) Luis Rengifo - LAA, 2B/3B, 28.1 - Rengifo's season ended on August 2nd after undergoing wrist surgery. He was in the midst of a fantasy breakout on the back of a career high by far 24 steals in just 78 games, but with a well below average 26.9 ft/sec sprint, and a previous career high of 6 steals, I don't know how many you can truly count on for 2025. The .300 BA was lucky with a .262 xBA, although the 14.5% K% was a career best, so it wasn't a complete fluke. And the rest of his profile is still lacking with a 2.5% Barrel% and .295 xwOBA. He's not good on defense either, playing a below average 2B, 3B, and SS. I'm just not buying into this, and with Christian Moore on the way (and Gleyber Torres rumors), I'm not even certain he's going to be a full time starter. He's just not one of my guys. (after writing this blurb, I looked at the objective projection I gave him, and it's not bad at all, but I'm still weary of it). - 2025 Projection: 73/15/68/.270/.324/.427/20

32) Tyler Fitzgerald - SFG, SS/2B, 27.7 - I use a 20 game cutoff for these positional rankings, but with Fitzgerald set to be San Francisco's starting 2B in 2024, I'm going to include him in these rankings. He had an insanely fun rookie year with 15 homers, 17 steals, and a .280 BA in 96 games, but there are so many warning signs going off, it's definitely making me hesitant to buy in too hard. The fantasy upside is undeniable with an elite 30 ft/sec sprint and 20.2 degree launch, so the power/speed numbers will be there, but the BA/OBP is a major, major risk. He put up a 31.7/6.5 K%/BB% with a 87.7/90.6 MPH AVG/FB EV. That is a recipe for a disaster batting average, especially hitting in San Francisco. The .292 xwOBA was much, much worse than the .367 wOBA. He was already starting to regress by the end of the season with a .592 OPS, 1 homer and a 36.3/6.2 K%/BB% in his final 36 games, so you can't even say the hit tool was improving as the year went on. His fantasy upside is so fun I thought I was going to like him more than I do, but there are just so many flashing red lights. - 2025 Projection: 67/21/61/.232/.298/.417/24

33) Orelvis Martinez - TOR, 2B/3B, 23.5 - Martinez got popped with an 80 game PED suspension in June, and I'm honestly struggling to figure out how much to dock him for that. I didn't dock Tatis much for his PED suspension, and that turned out to be a good move. But Tatis was an established MLB superstar already. I then followed suit by not docking Noelvi Marte much, and that looks like a mistake with him possibly being the worst player in MLB last year, dropping off everywhere you look. Martinez clearly fits better into the Noelvi mold than Tatis mold, but everyone is their own person, and I don't want Marte's season to influence Martinez' ranking too much for me. Martinez returned in September and he put up a .882 OPS with 1 homer in 11 games at Triple-A, so that is a good sign that the suspension won't impact him that much. And before the suspension, he was beasting the league with 17 homers, a 13.1% Barrel%, 46.1% Hard Hit%, 23.8/8.5 K%/BB%, and a 120 wRC+ in 74 games. His power is no joke with 30+ potential on the MLB level. Toronto traded for Gimenez, but 3B is still open for the taking, and it wouldn't be crazy to see Martinez win that role pretty quickly into 2025 (pending any off-season moves). I'm going to stay a bit restrained here because of the suspension, but I don't want to be overly scared off. This is a big time power bat who is knocking on the door of the bigs with opportunity. I'm cautiously buying. - 2025 Projection: 36/12/43/.229/.298/.422/1 Prime Projection:  76/28/87/.247/.323/.477/3

34) Ronny Mauricio - NYM, 2B, 24.0 - I'm fighting off the prospect creep of "out of sight, out of mind," because even when you are aware of that mind virus, it can still take a hold of you. Mauricio missed all of 2024 after undergoing surgery for a torn ACL that he suffered after a non contact injury on the bases in Winter Ball. It was deju vu all over again with Edwin Diaz tearing his knee in the WBC the off-season before that, but Diaz came back to basically full strength this season, and Mauricio can do the same in 2025. He hit the ball very hard with a 90.7 MPH EV in 26 games in the majors and a 91.1 MPH EV at Triple-A, he loves to run with 7 steals in the majors and 24 steals at Triple-A, and he gets the bat on the ball with a 18.2% K% at Triple-A. That K% jumped to 28.7% in the majors, he chases a ton, he hits the ball on the ground a lot and despite loving to run, he's not a burner. He doesn't really have the speed to lose, so the knee injury is definitely concerning in the stolen base department at the least. I definitely have the pull to drop him down the rankings, but I'm fighting it with everything I have, because at full strength, Mauricio has a very fantasy friendly skillset. - 2025 Projection: 37/10/46/.248/.304/.419/8 Prime Projection: 75/22/77/.267/.325/.454/16

35) Luke Keaschall - MIN, 2B/OF, 22.8 - Keaschall's season ended on August 8th with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery, but we all know by now that you don't need elbows to hit. Ohtani just went 54/59 while rehabbing from internal brace or whatever super secret surgery he underwent. Keaschall ain't Ohtani, but point being, I don't think the surgery should ding his value too much. And his value was starting to get pretty exciting with him proving the profile will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .281/.393/.439 with 8 homers, 9 steals, and a 19.1/12.0 K%/BB% in 58 games at Double-A. He doesn't have huge raw power, but he hits the ball fairly hard, and can definitely lift and pull it with a 35.3% GB% and 50.3% Pull%. He's got speed, he gets the bat on the ball, and he has a good approach. It's possible the good but not great tools will play down a bit on the major league level, and he's also not a particularly good defensive player, so he's going to have to hit. But a lift, speed, contact, approach profile is a lot of boxes to check, and the profile is fantasy friendly. - 2025 Projection: 18/4/12/.247/.304/.399/5 Prime Projection: 82/19/72/.266/.334/.436/19

36) Adael Amador - COL, 2B, 22.0 - I warned that Amador's elite hit tool would take a step back in the upper minors in my Predicting the 2025 Top 50 Prospects Rankings last off-season, writing," Amador's strikeout rate won't be as elite in the upper minors as it was in the lower minors, and like many Rockies hitters who go from their hitter's park haven at High-A to their more neutral Double-A park, the offensive production won't be as eye popping. His value won't tank but it won't explode either." ... that is essentially exactly what happened with a .230 BA and 19.3/13.6 K%/BB% in 100 games. And his value actually tanked more than I thought it would, but I'm not sure it deserves to tank that hard. The .261 BABIP shows he was definitely on the unlucky side, and he still had 14 homers, 35 steals, and a 111 wRC+, so it was far from a disaster season. Colorado rushed him to the majors for 10 games in June because they are one of the weirdest franchises out there, but I would ignore those numbers. The 2B job is wide open for him, and while the power likely ends up below average, the hit, plate approach, and speed can certainly make a fantasy impact. - 2025 Projection: 28/5/26/.246/.305/.371/10 Prime Projection: 84/17/62/.273/.341/.426/27

37) Otto Lopez - MIA, 2B, 26.4 - I love it when I think I'm going to be lukewarm on a player, and then after really diving in, I realize I like him more than I thought I would. That's Lopez for me, and I'm kinda liking him a lot right now. He got his first real shot at the majors in 2024, and he played well enough to seemingly lock down Miami's starting 2B job. He has a strong contact/speed/defense combo that transferred to the majors with a 17.3% K%, .270 BA, 20 steals (28.7 ft/sec sprint), a 12.2 defensive value and 6 homers in 117 games. But the thing that makes me like him so much, is that he hits the ball damn hard for this type of profile. He put up a 88/93.1 MPH AVG/FB EV in the majors, and he had a 92.2 MPH EV in 12 games at Triple-A. He didn't hit the ball nearly this hard in 2023, but it seems to me he might have had a true raw power uptick in his age 25 year old season. The 5.4 degree launch is low, so he's not going to have some big homer power breakout, but it's a recipe for a high batting average, which he's had his entire career. He struggled vs lefties and he doesn't walk a lot (5.8% BB%), so it's likely a bottom of the order profile on most days. I'm not saying I see some big breakout coming, but if you miss out on the more hyped contact/speed/defense plays (Hoerner, Stott, Gimenez etc), Lopez could quite frankly equal their production at a fraction of the cost. - 2025 Projection: 76/10/61/.275/.321/.398/25

38) Nolan Gorman - STL, 2B, 24.11 - The Cards announced that they want to get a full season of at bats for Gorman and Jordan Walker without the threat of demotion, but for Gorman, it doesn't look crystal clear how that is going to happen at the moment, although a Nolan Arenado trade would help clear that path. His hit tool went in the wrong direction in 2024, tanking with a 37.6% K% and .209 BA. The power was just fine with a 16.7% Barrel% and 19 homers in 107 games, but his hit tool was bad to begin with, and it just went from bad to worse. It doesn't give a ton of hope that he is magically going to make major, major strides there, and he's a bad defensive player, so he's going to need to improve it considerably if he wants to remain an everyday player. There is also platoon risk even if he can make those improvements. I want to call Gorman a buy low, because he's a 25 year old with a career .335 xwOBA and a proven carrying tool in his power, but the hit tool/defense/platoon risk combo is stopping me short from going too hard. - 2025 Projection: 64/26/72/.224/.302/.436/6

39) Brendan Donovan - STL, 2B/OF, 28.3 - All the hubbub over Donovan's 2023 Spring Training power surge turned out to be real (I thought it was real at the time as well), but 14 homers in 153 games is still lackluster, especially when it comes with only 5 steals. The plate skills are elite with a 12.4/7.2 K%/BB%, and it's led to a career 119 wRC+, but a 123 overall finish on the Razzball Player Rater in 2024 shows it's not a fantasy friendly profile. He's pretty close to an empty BA play, which are not my types of players. I want to like Donovan more than I actually do. - 2025 Projection: 76/16/68/.280/.352/.419/6

40) Hye-seong Kim - FRA, 2B, 26.2 - Kim is a free agent coming over from Korea, and while he could find an everyday job, I guess there is no guarantee of that. He doesn't have the power production for him to be a no doubt MLB starter right out of the gate, but the contact/speed/defense profile is one that plenty of starting 2B have, so he can certainly end up with one. He slashed .326/.383/.458 with 11 homers, 30 steals, and a 10.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 127 games in the KBO. We can look at Jung Hoo Lee as a comp who just came over last year. Both are lefties and the same age with similar profiles. Lee is 2 inches taller, had much better contact rates, much better walk rates, and much better power numbers. He didn't run nearly as much though, and steals are a huge part of fantasy, so that is a nice edge to Kim. Kim isn't as good as Lee overall, but Lee's skills more or less transferred to the bigs, so I don't see why Kim's couldn't too. Just check out this homer he hit in 2023. I would say that swing could play. If he finds a full time job, I'm apt to buy here. - 2025 Projection: 65/8/50/.260/.307/.372/21 Prime Projection: 77/10/61/.273/.321/.398/26

41) Gavin Lux - LAD, 2B, 27.4 - The good news is that Lux got back to being a solid real life hitter in 2024 with a 100 wRC+ in 139 games after returning from a torn ACL, MCL, and hamstring that knocked him out for all of 2023. He was even better in the 2nd half the further removed he got from the injury, slashing .306/.390/.513 with 8 homers, 2 steals, and a 24.7/11.7 K%/BB% in his final 65 games. The bad news is that his fantasy profile is still severely lacking. His speed dropped off considerably with a 27.7 ft/sec sprint, and he was barely running even before the injury, so we can't count on much there. The power is also lacking with only 10 homers, a 9.1 degree launch, and a below average 6% Barrel%. Granted, those numbers were all considerably better in that 2nd half run, so I do think he can do better than 10, but we aren't talking about a power hitter here. The hit tool is only average-ish, and that includes the elevated K rate in that 2nd half run. And finally, he was terrible vs lefties, so he might be maxed in a platoon role. I can definitely see him putting up some pretty good "sum of his parts" fantasy seasons in the next few years, but the upside isn't very high. He's a low end option. - 2025 Projection: 73/14/61/.266/.339/.408/8

42) Cole Young - SEA, 2B/SS, 21.8 - Young put up a 119 wRC+ in 124 games at Double-A as a 20/21 year old, which is impressive, but he did it on the back of an elite 15.8/12.1 K%/BB%, making him a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect. He hit only 9 homers, there isn't big raw power in here, and he's not a guy looking to hit dingers with a low launch, all fields approach, so he doesn't project for big power either. The biggest blow to his fantasy value is that he isn't a good base stealer, going 23 for 34, and he's not a true burner, so his upside on the bases is questionable too. I don't think we should underrate the fact that he was 20 years old at Double-A, and that includes the power/speed numbers, so I don't want to to be overly harsh, but he remains a better real life than fantasy prospect, which has been the book on him since being drafted. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/17/62/.278/.349/.426/18

43) Michael Arroyo - SEA, 2B, 20.5 - Arroyo always had precocious plate skills, writing in his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "He looks like a seasoned vet at the dish, and is the type who jumps out immediately when you watch him hit. He’s completely locked in and makes hitting a baseball look easy." But I questioned his power upside at only 5'8'', and in 2024, he answered those power questions in a resounding fashion. He clubbed 23 homers in 120 games split between Single-A and High-A, and he did it while remaining a good all around hitter, slashing .285/.400/.509 with a 23.0/12.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, and he can hit the ball hard. His swing looks damn quick to me too. He's not a burner, but he can run a little bit too with 18 steals. There certainly seems to be some little man discount going on here, because Arroyo has a lot to be excited about. He's easily a Top 100 dynasty prospect, and if he were 6'2'', we might be talking about him in an entirely different way. The biggest issue is that Seattle will be his home ballpark, and without huge raw power, it's going to limit his upside. That is why I would hesitate to stick your neck out too much, but I still like him a lot. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/77/.268/.347/.445/14

44) Tommy Troy - ARI, 2B/SS, 23.3 - Troy saved his season at the end of the year, because it looked like his dynasty value was in a nose dive before slashing .276/.375/.447 with 4 homers, 9 steals, and a 22.2/11.8 K/BB% in his last 32 games at High-A. He then went to the AFL and kept on hitting with a .864 OPS in 22 games. A hamstring injury knocked out 2 months of his season early in the year, and it seemed like he just couldn't find a rhythm when he returned, so there is something to point to for the slow start. The skills and general explosiveness of his game that got him drafted 12th overall are all still there. His hype definitely dropped this year, but I would be careful about selling too low here. He's still a Top 100 prospect for me. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/18/71/.251/.320/.427/23

45) Ryan Bliss - SEA, 2B/SS, 25.4 - Maybe I got a little too overexcited about Bliss when I named him a major target mid-season, but I still love his potential fantasy impact relative to his super, super subdued hype, and at the moment, there is a clear path to the 2B job (which of course could change in an instant). The main selling point is the stolen base upside with him stealing 50 bags in 93 bags at Triple-A. But what makes him so exciting, is that he is not just a light hitting speedster. He can actually hit the ball pretty damn hard, and he showed that in his MLB debut with a 88.5/98.2 MPH AVG/FB EV. The EV was strong at Triple-A too with an 88.8 MPH EV. He's not a huge lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull enough to rip some dingers (12 in 93 games at AAA), and especially in Seattle's ballpark, we don't want him to lift and pull. Hitting the ball hard all over the field works perfectly for his profile. He's also a good 2B. The biggest issue is that the hit tool is not quite optimal for this type of profile. He put up a 22.4% K% at AAA and a 31% K% in the majors. The plate approach is good with a 14.1% BB% at AAA and an excellent 21% Chase% in the majors, which mitigates the hit tool somewhat, but not all the way. That is the thing holding me back from going too crazy, but Bliss could be free to very cheap in most leagues, and why not take a shot. - 2025 Projection: 61/13/52/.237/.304/.380/23 Prime Projection: 77/17/66/.254/.325/.416/31

46) Nick Gonzales - PIT, 2B, 25.10 - Gonzales is the front runner to be Pittsburgh's starting 2B in 2025, and while he does have competition in Nick Yorke and ultimately Termarr Johnson, he has an exciting enough skillset to mark him as one your cheap, low end targets. His hit tool took a monster step forward this year with a 16.2% K and .356 BA in 34 games at Triple-A, which he backed up in the majors with a 19.1% K%, 24.9% whiff%, and .270 BA in 94 games. It sat at 26.6% at Triple-A in 2023. His power also ticked up with a 90.8 MPH EV at Triple-A and an above average 7.9% Barrel% with a decent 87.9 MPH EV in the majors. He had a 87.4 MPH EV at Triple-A in 2023. He can also lift the ball with a 13 degree launch, so he should get the most out of his average, maybe slightly above average power at peak. And he's damn fast with a near elite 29.2 ft/sec sprint, although he's not a big base stealer. His numbers in the majors don't jump off the page with 7 homers, 5 steals, and a 94 wRC+ in 94 games, and I do think that shows there might not be big upside in here, but I definitely think he has the potential to be a useful fantasy bat, especially in deeper leagues. He's also a good defensive 2B who can play some SS in a jam, so his glove could be the separator which keeps him on the field. - 2025 Projection: 66/17/75/.260/.318/.419/8

47) Brooks Lee - MIN, SS/3B/2B, 24.2 - I've always been a bit low on Lee for fantasy, because a good but not great hit tool first profile, with moderate power and little speed is just not something I go after, even with him getting ranked very high on real life lists. I also wasn't buying into the 8 homers he hit in 25 games at Triple-A this year because of the below average exit velocity and low launch, and sure enough, his MLB debut didn't look great. He slashed .221/.265/.320 with 3 homers, 3 steals, and a 14.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 50 games. His 25.6 ft/sec sprint speed is in the bottom 13% of the league. That is brutal, and it might be part of the reason why the guy scored a shockingly low 9 runs. The EV numbers were poor too with a 85.8 MPH EV and 4.1% Barrel%. And he chases a lot with a 35.8% Chase%, so he doesn't really fit in at the top of the order. He gets the bat on the ball and there is some pop in there, so I never thought he would be a bust or anything, I just thought the upside was low as a solid but not standout hitter, and I still believe that today. He's still not a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 64/14/73/.259/.313/.415/6 Prime Projection: 73/18/81/.277/.331/.436/8

48) Nick Yorke - PIT, 2B, 23.0 - Yorke was quietly smashing the ball all season at Triple-A with a 91.5 MPH EV, and then he got called up to the majors and put up a 15.4% Barrel%, 89.7 MPH EV, and a .383 xwOBA in 42 PA. He's damn fast with a double plus 28.9 ft/sec sprint, he has a strong plate approach (24.4% Chase%), and he has a potentially above average to plus hit tool (.333 BA with a 18.9/12.2K%/BB% at AAA, plus a .290 xBA in the majors). I want to get really damn excited and tell you to target him everywhere, but there are a few things which I can't just gloss over. He has a mostly line drive approach, so the game power isn't huge right now, and he's not a great base stealer, so he's not going to rack up steals either. Really his biggest issue is that he isn't a good defensive player. Nick Gonzales is the better defender and he had a relatively exciting year as well, so he's the favorite for the job in the short term, and Termarr Johnson is the favorite to man 2B in the long run. That leaves Yorke as a utility type (he played 2B, OF, and 3B this year). Injuries happen and the cream generally rises to the top, so if Yorke hits, and I think he will, he is very likely to find plenty of at bats in 2025. Without being the favorite for a full time job, I wouldn't be willing to really reach for him, but I will be hoping to scoop him up on the cheap everywhere I can. - 2025 Projection: 46/11/51/.252/.308/.403/10 Prime Projection: 81/18/73/.273/.334/.430/14

49) Yoeilin Cespedes - BOS, SS/2B, 19.7 - Cespedes' season ended on June 21st a broken hamate, but he was one of the top rookie ball breakouts before going down with the injury. He slashed .319/.400/.615 with 5 homers, 3 steals, and a 18.1/11.4 K%/BB% in 25 games. It was good for a 163 wRC+, and this was coming off the 145 wRC+ he put up in the DSL in 2023. He's a lift and pull machine who takes absolute daddy hacks at the dish with a monster righty swing. He swings much bigger than his 5'8'' size would indicate. I'm thinking the contact rates could take a step back in full season ball, but I believe in the power despite not being a huge human being. If the contact rates don't take a step back, we could be looking at a very potent hit/power combo, and even if they do, he should remain a very good prospect. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/25/84/.268/.329/.458/8

50) Demetrio Crisantes - ARI, 2B, 20.7 - Crisantes doesn't necessarily jump off the screen when you watch him, but he has a very quick and controlled righty swing, which he combines with plus plate skills, that has resulted in him raking everywhere he's played. He made it to Single-A by the 2nd half of the season and slashed .333/.429/.478 with 6 homers, 20 steals, and a 15.9/12.9 K%/BB% in 63 games. He can hit the ball relatively hard, and there is room to tack on more mass at 6'0'', 178 pounds. The swing is geared more for average than power right now, he's not a true burner, so the steal totals could come down against more advanced competition, and many of the best players at Single-A got promoted by the time he hit the league (that one is a very small one, but it's something knocking around in my brain on 2nd half lines at Single-A). I like him, but I wouldn't go too crazy for him quite yet. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/18/73/.272/.331/.427/20

51) Roderick Arias - NYY, SS/2B, 20.7 - Arias was one of the top bets to go full elite prospect status in 2024, and it's good reminder that even though it can feel like a rookie ball prospect is inevitable, they aren't actually inevitable. There is a lot of inherent risk if you haven't even hit full season ball yet. Arias struggled to adjust for the first 3+ months of the season with a .652 OPS and 34.9% K%, but he finally found his groove in the final 2 months, giving hope that the big prospect breakout can still happen in 2025. In his final 47 games he slashed .276/.390/.471 with 7 homers, 16 steals, and a 24.4/14.6 K%/BB%. The strikeout rate has been high throughout his career, so there is definitely hit tool risk here, but he hits the ball hard, he has speed and he gets on base. I don't think it's fair to expect a truly elite prospect breakout anymore. You are really aiming for those rocket ships with little to no bumps in the road, and that isn't quite Arias. But just because his stock took a hit, doesn't mean he's not a really talented prospect. Just more of a Top 100-150 one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/77/.247/.326/.442/23

52) Willi Castro - MIN, OF/3B/2B, 27.11 - Castro is a super utility player who was an overall positive on defense (+3.9 Fangraphs value), he hits at the top of the order, scoring 89 runs, and he amassed a ton of at bats with 635 PA. The nature of his everyday role feels a bit precarious long term, but short term it does seem likely he will get a ton of at bats again. He wasn't able to maintain his outlier steal season in 2023 (33 steals), coming back down to earth with 14 in 23 attempts, and he doesn't hit for much power (12 homers with a 87.4 MPH EV) or hit for a high BA (.247 BA with a 23.6% K%). He's optimally getting more like 400-500 PA per season, and not 600+, but right now, it does seem like his path to 600+ is still there. I'm not too intrigued by him in dynasty except in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 77/13/58/.250/.330/.397/17

53) Jorge Polanco - FRA, 2B, 31.9 - Polanco got traded to Seattle's death on hitters ballpark, and he died a thousand deaths in one season with a terrible year. He slashed .213/.296/.355 with a 29.2/9.8 K%/BB% in 118 games.  We just saw Teoscar die a similar death and then have a big year in a better park in 2024. Polanco isn't as good as Teoscar, so Teoscar's down year wasn't as bad, but the hope is that Polanco can do the same thing on his own scale. He still put up a well above average 8.9% Barrel%, and he was on pace for over 20 homers if he played a full season. A hamstring injury knocked him out for over a month, and he can't blame the ballpark on that as he's been plagued by injuries the past few seasons. If he lands in the right ballpark, I definitely think he will bounce back and return to being a fantasy asset, but the injuries are starting to pile up, and he's not getting any younger at 31/32 in 2025, so he's only a low end win now option. - 2025 Projection: 67/23/73/.245/.321/.435/5

54) Chase Meidroth - CHW, 2B/3B/SS, 23.9 - Meidroth was part of the return for Garrett Crochet, and if Chicago didn't think he has a very good chance of being a starting caliber player, why would they even want him included. It sure feels like he's the favorite for the starting 2B job right out of the gate, which is a big boost to his value. Unfortunately, that big boost still doesn't boost him very high in my book. The power is lacking with only 7 homers, a 5 degree launch, and a 2.2% Barrel% in 122 games at Triple-A, and so is the speed with 13 steals in 19 attempts. An elite plate approach is his game with a 12.7/18.8 K%/BB%, which led to a .293 BA, .437 OBP, and a 132 wRC+. His 88.6 MPH EV also isn't bad, so while it hasn't led to homers, it could be good enough to maintain the high BA/OBP on the MLB level. If he were potentially hitting atop a really good lineup, I could see real fantasy value here, but in the White Sox lineup, the fantasy value is likely to be lacking for the next few seasons. I can see a path to a solid fantasy player, but it's not a journey I'm looking to go on. - 2025 Projection: 63/11/49/.255/.320/.386/7 Prime Projection: 84/15/61/.276/.352/.416/9

55) Sal Stewart - CIN, 2B/3B, 21.4 - If you like a plus plate approach, Stewart is your man. He put up a 16.9/14.8 K%/BB% in 80 games at High-A which led to a 144 wRC+. It's basically the same thing he did in 2023 and 2022. But he's not just a plus plate approach, he also has very real raw power. Just watch him crush this dinger 454 feet out to centerfield. This is a big physical guy in the box who can certainly unleash more game power if he tries. He hit only 8 homers this year and he likes to spray liners all over the field, so he would definitely have to change his hitting approach to do it, which may or may not work. He might just be content to plate approach his way through the minors. I don't love betting on plate approach guys who don't have much speed and aren't particularly good defensive players, but if he does unlock more game power, he could end up having a very potent hit/power combo at peak. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/21/76/.274/.350/.452/9

56) David Hamilton - BOS, SS/2B, 27.6 - If I was more certain that Hamilton truly had a stable full time job, I could see liking him a ton for fantasy, but I think Boston views him more as a heavily used utility player, which limits how high I'm willing to go. Kristian Campbell could conceivably win the 2B job out of camp, and Marcelo Mayer is coming soon too. There is just too much competition, and quite frankly, Hamilton just isn't a good enough real life hitter to stave them off. He has a career 85 wRC+ in 113 career MLB games, and he had a 92 wRC+ in 98 games in 2024. He's a solid middle infielder, but he's not so good that his glove is going to truly force him on the field. The last negative is that the hit tool isn't good enough for this type of profile with a .248 BA and 25.2/6.9 K%/BB%. He's a straight demon on the bases with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint and 33 steals (in 98 games), so he can make a fantasy impact in daily moves leagues even without a full time job, and his 5.6% Barrel% isn't bad, so he can pop some dingers too (8 homers), but I just don't see a full time player here long term. - 2025 Projection: 48/8/33/.244/.309/.398/26

57) James Triantos - CHC, 2B, 22.2 - Triantos ran a ton in 2024, stealing 47 bags in 115 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. I'm leading with that because it gives his profile an upside boost which he needed for fantasy. The contact rates have consistently ranged from plus to elite throughout his minor league career, putting up an 11.1 K% this season, but both the game power and raw power are well below average. He put up a 85.9 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 2 degree launch. He doesn't walk much with a 5.6% BB%, which isn't great for his chances to hit at the top of the lineup, and he's not really an asset on defense as a solid 2B. The hit/speed combo is certainly good enough to make him a good fantasy prospect, but lack of impact, OBP and defense keeps him as more of a Top 150 prospect for me. - 2025 Projection: 19/2/11/.260/.303/.365/7 Prime Projection: 81/11/52/.282/.328/.408/26

58) Spencer Horwitz - PIT, 1B/2B, 27.5 - With Vlad locked in at 1B, and Toronto giving up on Horwitz as a 2B, Horwitz looked like a bench bat in Toronto, so this move to Pitt with their 1B job wide open is a nice bump in value for Horwitz. He's now the favorite for the lion's share of that job. He struggled hard vs. lefties in 2024, so it's likely a strong side of a platoon role, and he doesn't really have the power you want for a 1B, so he's still not a target for me, but at least he's now more interesting in medium to deeper leagues. He proved his bat will play in his rookie year, slashing .265/.357/.433 with 12 homers, 0 steals, and a 18.4/11.0 K%/BB% in 97 MLB games. The 8% Barrel% was above average, and the 88.2 MPH EV was solid. The problem is still that he's a 1B/DH with moderate power at best and a good but not great hit tool. The bat speed is well below average and the sprint speed is in the bottom 7% of the league. He's also already 27 years old. The upside just isn't very high. - 2025 Projection: 68/15/62/.260/.338/.417/3

59) Michael Massey - KCR, 2B, 27.0 - The Royals brought in India this off-season, and while it seems they still have room for Massey to get full time at bats, it's not great for him. The bigger problem is that he's just not that good. He's not bad though either, which is what keeps him on the radar. He's coming off his best season where he put up a .743 OPS with 14 homers in 100 games, but it came with 1 steal, a .259 BA and a 4.2% BB%. The 7.1% Barrel% is about average, the 92.8 MPH FB EV isn't all that great, and the ballpark is terrible. He improved his hit tool with a career best 15.7% K%, but it came at the cost of his plate approach with a career worst 37.4% Chase. The fantasy upside is capped and the real life upside is capped too. There is also no guarantee of full time at bats. He's a very low end option. - 2025 Projection: 61/17/69/.250/.300/.416/4

60) Jake Cronenworth - SDP, 2B/1B, 31.2 - Cronenworth bounced back from a down 2023, but it's still not a fantasy friendly profile at all. He hit .241 with 17 homers and 5 steals in 155 games. He has plus plate skills and he can lift it, but he doesn't hit it hard enough in the air to fully take advantage of it. It's average to below average across the board, which is fine, but nothing to be excited about. - 2025 Projection: 74/16/74/.238/.320/.394/6

61) Thairo Estrada - COL, 2B, 29.1 - Estrada signed a 1 year, $3.25 million contract with the Rockies, and the contract number really says it all. Estrada is not a very sought after player, and while having a starting job and hitting in Coors clearly bumps up his value, I'm not targeting him. The Coors bump isn't close to what it used to be, and he only stole 2 bags in 96 games last year, which is where he derived most of his value. He's never had an above average xwOBA in any season in his entire career, and it bottomed out to .263 in 2024. Having a job puts him back on the late round radar, but that is about it. He's also just keeping the seat warm for Adael Amador, so he might not even hold onto the starting job for very long. - 2025 Projection: 66/13/49/.258/.310/.408/13

62) Thomas Saggese - STL, 2B/3B/SS, 23.0 - Saggese was always a guy who produced above his tools, demanding respect in the prospect world despite being a 5th round pick, but pro ball finally caught up with him at Triple-A. He put up 93 wRC+ with a 23.1/5.9 K%/BB% in 125 games. He then got a cup of coffee in the majors where he struggled hard with a 57 wRC+ and 26.9/3.8 K%/BB% in 52 PA. He just doesn't hit the ball hard enough (87.3 MPH at AAA and 85.7 MPH in the majors), or have good enough plate skills (see K/BB above), or run enough (9 steals) to be too enticing of a fantasy prospect. There also isn't much defensive value, so it's not like the glove will force him on the field. I'm not saying he can't be a solid bat at peak, because I think he can be, I'm just not too enthused about rostering him until it maybe happens. - 2025 Projection: 25/5/29/.237/.293/.389/2 Prime Projection: 66/19/74/.259/.318/.420/8

63) Edouard Julien - MIN, 2B, 25.11 - I poured some cold water on Julien last off-season, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "I was the party pooper on a Minnesota infielder last off-season (Jose Miranda), and I’m going to do it again with another Minnesota infielder this year, Edouard Julien. What gives me pause, in 5×5 BA leagues especially, are that his strikeout rates are high (31.4%), his groundball rates are high (50.2%), he’s a below average defensive player, he has below average speed (27 ft/sec sprint), and he struggled majorly vs. lefties (.447 OPS in 48 MLB PA and .758 OPS in 91 PA at Triple-A)." ... All of those deficiencies were on full display in 2024 and it resulted in him losing his job mid-season and getting sent back down to the minors. He got called back up in August, but he was even worse than before. He put up a 80 wRC+ with 8 homers, 6 steals, and a 33.9/11.0 K%/BB%  in 94 games on the season. He still hit the ball hard with a 9.8% Barrel%, and he still walked a ton with a 11% BB%, but that is all he did well. He dug himself a hole to get another shot at a starting job, and it doesn't look like he has one going into 2024. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/42/.231/.327/.413/8

64) Jeral Perez - CHW, 2B, 20.5 - Perez getting traded from LA to CHI is a major developmental downgrade, and while it does theoretically create a better path to playing time down the line, I don't think the trade off is worth it. Perez has a lot of development left to go as he's only reached Single-A. Having said that, he's still a really good lower minors prospect. I gave him the Andy Pages 2.0 comp, and that really sums him up pretty well. They are both 6'0'' righties with relatively extreme lift and pull profiles, above average to plus raw power, a plus plate approach, and mid 20 K rates. He slashed .262/.370/.423 with 12 homers, 4 steals, and a 22.9/12.9 K%/BB% in 105 games. Andy Pages set a strong foundation for himself in 2024 to be an above average MLB bat, and Perez has the potential to do the same in a few years. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/22/80/.255/.332/.440/6

65) Jose Caballero - TBR, 2B/SS/3B, 28.7 - Carson Williams is going to take over Tampa's SS job sooner rather than later, which is going to relegate Caballero to his rightful role as a utility player. He's terrible on offense with a 83 wRC+, .267 xwOBA, an 83.7 MPH EV and a 27.5/5.6 K%/BB% in 139 games. He's good on defense, but he's not that good to overcome that offense. He's a great base stealer, racking up 44 steals, which is the sole area where he derives his fantasy value. He's a bench role player for deep leagues. - 2025 Projection: 48/8/39/.233/.299/.352/26

66) Caleb Durbin - MIL, 2B/3B, 25.1 - I see the huge offensive season Durbin just had at Triple-A, slashing .287/.396/.471 with 10 homers, 29 steals, and a 9.9/12.5 K%/BB% in 82 games (he was even better in the AFL with a .976 OPS in 24 games), but I'm struggling to get past the extremely low 83 MPH EV. He's only 5'6'', he's already 25 years old (as of 2025 Opening Day), and while he has a solid infield glove, he's not some slick fielding SS whose glove will get him on the field. It seems like a utility infielder profile to me, and while the trade to Milwaukee helps his value, I'm not sure he's more than a utility infielder on their team either. On the other hand, his contact/speed combo gives him a very clear path to fantasy usefulness if he does work his way into the lineup. He can also lift and pull it, which we know can overcome a low EV, but an 83 MPH EV isn't just low, it's among the worst in baseball low. I know Durbin has his big supporters, and while I'm not one of them, I understand what they see with contact, speed, lift, pull, and proximity. I don't mind him as a proximity play, but he's not really one of my guys. - 2025 Projection: 49/7/33/.250/.313/.360/17 Prime Projection: 76/10/58/.271/.325/.383/26

67) Davis Schneider - TOR, 2B/OF, 26.2 - Schnedier wasn't able to back up his impressive rookie season. His hit tool tanked with a .191 BA and 31.7% K%. He played a solid 2B, but there isn't much defensive value there either. The poor sophomore season now puts him in a battle with sooooooo many similarly talented fringy type players in Toronto. The thing that keeps him ranked even this high is that he still put up an excellent 12% Barrel%, so the power potential is in here if he can improve the hit tool. The 21.4 degree launch with a 88.6/93.1 MPH FB/EV ensure he will hit dingers, but it also looks like a recipe for an extremely low BA. I was all for taking a shot on Schneider coming off his excellent rookie season, but it didn't really pan out. He's a bench bat who could be useful if he works his way into a full time job, but that isn't a very unique profile. - 2025 Projection: 41/13/44/.221/.312/.416/5

68) Kahlil Watson - CLE, 2B/OF, 22.0 - Cleveland selecting Bazzana first overall is an absolute killer for Watson's path to playing time, but the biggest killer to his path to playing time is the hit tool. He just put up a 30.7% K% with a .220 BA in 96 games at Double-A. He was only 21 years old, so there is some age to level leeway you can give him, and he still put up a 104 wRC+, so he wasn't bad. The electric power/speed combo that made him a hyped high school prospect is still here with 16 homers and 15 steals. Even with the hit tool risk, I still like him for fantasy, but he has to get on the field in order to help us. And it just doesn't seem like a team is going to hand him a full time job anytime soon. This could shape up to be more of a mid to late 20's type breakout scenario. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/20/71/.233/.316/.425/15

69) Will Wagner - TOR, 2B, 26.8 - Wagner is smack dab in the middle of Toronto's fringy young player clusterf*ck, and while his excellent plate approach and strong MLB debut could put him in the pole position for playing time, he just doesn't have the type of profile I like rostering. He put up a 125 wRC+ in his 24 game MLB debut, but it came with 2 homers and 0 steals. He swings a slow bat (68.9 MPH), he's slow himself (26.4 ft/sec sprint), and he doesn't hit the ball all that hard (88.1 MPH EV with a 4.4% Barrel% at Triple-A). He had a 90.6 MPH EV with a 9.1% Barrel% in the majors, but the AAA numbers were the bigger sample. The hit tool and approach are the calling card (10.4/16.6 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 18.6% K% and .305 BA in the majors), but as you guys already know well, this isn't my type of player. He's a fine 2B, so it's not like his glove is really going to force the issue either. He's a bench infielder long term, and even if he does get a full time job, the upside isn't worth it. - 2025 Projection: 35/6/35/.275/.323/.407/3

70) Curtis Mead - TBR, 2B/3B, 24.5 - Mead isn't good on defense, he hits lefties much better than righties, he has below average speed, he doesn't walk a ton, and he's not really a big power hitter. That is just a lot of negatives to overcome. The hit tool is good, but it's not great. He's been terrible in the majors with 2 homers, 2 steals, a 78 wRC+ and a 22.8/5.8 K%/BB% in 224 PA. He's only 24, and I do still think he can become a solid MLB hitter, but the upside isn't very high even if he can reach that upside. - 2025 Projection 18/4/22/.248/.304/.391/1 Prime Projection: 58/16/66/.263/.317/.422/6

71) Juan Brito - CLE, 2B, 23.6 - Brito isn't a good defensive player and Cleveland has started to move him all over the field (1B, 2B, 3B, OF), which isn't a good sign because he doesn't really have that no doubt offensive upside either. But his season at Triple-A was too good to leave off this list. He slashed .256/.365/.443 with 21 homers, 13 steals, and a 16.1/13.5 K%/BB% in 144 games. The 87.3 MPH EV isn't great, but it's not terrible, and it came with a 17.5 degree launch and a 47% Pull%. We know that a strong plate approach with a lift and pull profile can most certainly work. If he can get into the lineup, he should be a rock solid MLB hitter, but his glove could cause problems on that front. - 2025 Projection: 22/5/27/.241/.302/.394/2 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.259/.328/.430/8

72) Dylan Moore - SEA, SS/3B/2B/OF, 32.8 - Moore is a heavily used utility player whose most valuable format would be a deeper OBP, daily moves league. There is value in here if you can start him vs. lefites (.762 OPS vs .639 OPS vs. righties). He stole 32 bags in 441 PA, which is where he derives most of his value, and he can also pop some dingers with a 8.8% Barrel% and 22.6 degree launch, leading to 10 homers. The hit tool is brutal with a career .206 BA (.201 in 2024), but the .316 OBP is where he can be decent in OBP leagues. He currently has a full time job, but let's see what Seattle does the rest of the off-season. Even with a full time job, he's still just a medium to deep league role player. - 2025 Projection: 59/14/48/.210/.315/.396/28

73) Brooks Baldwin - CHW, 2B/SS, 24.7 - Colson Montgomery is going to take the starting SS job sooner rather than later, but if Chicago slow plays it, or if he struggles hard, Baldwin could be their best option at SS at the moment, and he has the speed to be fantasy relevant. He has a 29.1 ft/sec sprint and he stole 17 bags in 82 games in the upper minors, and then 4 bags in 33 games in the majors. He doesn't have big raw power with an 87.4 MPH EV, but he puts it in the air a ton with a 26.2 launch, so he can pop some dingers. It's certainly a fun homer/steal combo for fantasy, but the plate approach isn't good (25.6/5.0 K%/BB%), and he doesn't hit the ball hard to take advantage of the flyball rates, so it's a recipe for a super low BA (.211 BA). He's likely a utility infielder long term, but one with some fantasy upside. - 2025 Projection: 41/11/41/.227/.290/.393/14

74) Mike Boeve - MIL, 1B/2B/3B, 22.11 - Boeve is a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect with a solid hit tool and lackluster power/speed combo, but with Milwaukee's 3B job open right now, being a good real life hitter could get him into that lineup. I like Brock Wilken to take the job based on pedigree and upside, but just because I like that, doesn't mean it's going to happen. Boeve proved his hit tool will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .306/.374/.447 with 6 homers, 1 steal, and a 17.0/9.3 K%/BB% in 66 games. He has some raw power, but the launch is low and it's a line drive approach, so there isn't big homer upside, and he doesn't run much. He's not a small guy at a thick 6'1'', so it's possible for him to tap into more game power down the line. This isn't a profile I love buying into, but with the current opening at 3B, I can't ignore the possibility that he could hit his way into the role pretty quickly. - 2025 Projection: 23/5/27/.249/.300/.385/1 Prime Projection: 68/15/65/.269/.326/.418/4

75) Lenyn Sosa - CHW, 2B/3B, 25.2 - Sosa is in a scrum with a bunch of Chicago prospects for their middle infield jobs, and unfortunately, I don't think he is going to be one of the players to emerge, but that will proven on the field. He hits the ball pretty hard with a 89.0/93.0 MPH AVG/FB EV, he can lift it with a 12.3 degree launch, and he can get the bat on the ball with a 20.9% K%. That's not a bad collection of skills, and while it only resulted in an 80 wRC+ in 100 games, a lot of that was due to back luck with an average .316 xwOBA. The plate approach is terrible (3.3% BB%), he doesn't run, and he's not particularly good on defense, so I don't think he's a full time player, and guys like Colson Montgomery, Bryan Ramos, Miguel Vargas, Chase Meidroth and even Jacob Gonzalez are all going to pass him on the depth chart quite soon. - 2025 Projection: 35/11/42/.250/.298/.410/3

76) Isiah Kiner Falefa - PIT\, 2B/3B/SS, 30.0 - Falefa seems to be penciled in as Pitt's SS at the moment, which is not optimal for them. He's a very low end option with an above average glove and below average bat. The below average bat part is what he care about the most for fantasy with a .283 xwOBA in 2024, and he's never put up higher than a .294 xwOBA in his career. He will run a bit with mid teens stolen base ability, making him relevant in medium to deeper leagues if he really can hold onto this job by Opening Day, but I have a hard time believing he is going to be a full time starter at SS all season. - 2025 Projection: 62/8/46/.262/.308/.362/14

77) Richie Palacios - TBR, 2B/OF, 27.11 - Palacios is likely locked into a bench role, and a strong side of a platoon role at best, but he just put up a .325 xwOBA with 19 steals, a .346 OBP and zero contact issues in 316 PA, so he's kinda interesting. He's always had excellent plate skills, and that continued in the majors with a 21.2/14.2 K%/BB%. He doesn't have a ton of pop with a 3.5% Barrel% and 5 homers, but it's not nothing, and he's a good baserunner, going 19 for 20. Tampa isn't exactly super deep, so injuries or underperformance from their starters, combined with Palacios hitting well, could result in a bunch of at bats for him and fantasy relevance. - 2025 Projection: 57/9/41/.248/.337/.385/17

78) Cooper Bowman - CIN, 2B/OF, 25.2 - The Reds selected Bowman 7th overall in the Rule 5 Draft, which gives him a leg up on an Opening Day roster spot, and it seems like he could be next man up at several positions for them now. And if he does get pushed into full time action, he has the base running ability to make a fantasy impact with 43 steals in 118 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The Athletics left him unprotected for a reason, and that reason is that the hit/power combo probably isn't good enough to be a true MLB starter. He hit 0 homers with a 80.5 MPH EV, 24.3/7.9 K%, .218 BA and 48 wRC+ in 38 games at Triple-A. Granted he hit much better at Double-A with 12 homers, a 20.2/12.4 K%/BB% and a 138 wRC+ in 80 games, but at 24 years old, he's already too old to be taking his upper minors numbers fully seriously. I see some similarities with David Hamilton, and like Hamilton, if Bowman gets the at bats, the steals should keep him afloat in fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 38/6/31/.232/.304/.379/16

79) Hao-Yu Lee - DET, 2B, 22.2 - Lee's season ended on August 15th with lumbar spine inflammation, but he was having an impressive season before going down with the injury, slashing .298/.363/.488 with 12 homers, 16 steals, and a 17.9/8.5 K%/BB% in 87 games at Double-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+ as a 21 year old, which is damn good. He doesn't jump off the screen at 5'10'', and he doesn't jump off the screen electricity wise either, but he's just a really solid baseball player who has produced everywhere he's been, and now that's continued in the upper minors. The power/speed combo isn't huge, he's not particularly good on defense, and the hit tool is good, but not great, so he's not exactly one of my favorite targets, but there is average across the board potential here at peak. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/18/71/.261/.323/.416/12

80)  Jared Serna - MIA, 2B/SS, 22.10 - Serna's stats dropped off when he got to the upper minors, slashing .247/.328/.356 with 2 homers, 4 steals (in 7 attempts), and a 20.7/8.1 K%/BB% in 45 games. He's a small guy at 5'7'' with high ground ball rates, so the power upside is very limited. He has speed, but he started to get caught a lot in the upper minors, and the plate skills dropped off in the upper minors too. He's likely a utility infielder, but the Marlins entire infield is far from locked down, so he's on the right team for opportunity. I still think Miami has better options than him though. - 2025 Projection: 18/2/11/.246/.299/.351/6 Prime Projection: 61/9/42/.262/.323/.388/18

81) Payton Eeles - MIN, 2B/3B, 25.4 - Payton Eeles is the type of player you want to root for. He's 5'5'' and went undrafted after playing 4 years at a Division II school. So he played a 5th year in Division 1, and then he played in Indy Ball. And oh yea, he's literally raked everywhere he's been. Minnesota gave him a shot in 2024, and he continued to do what he's done everywhere, and that is produce all the way through Triple-A. He slashed .299/.419/.500 with 8 homers, 20 steals, and a 14.6/12.7 K%/BB% in 64 games. He's only 5'5'', but he's thick and he's damn explosive. He's almost like an older version of Jett Williams and Slade Caldwell, except without a one hundredth of the respect. He only put up an 85.4 MPH EV at Triple-A, and the groundball rates are around 50%, so there isn't much power upside, but the hit/speed combo looks pretty damn good. It's probably a utility infielder long term, which is still a super fun success story, but I wouldn't be so sure to cap him there. I think he has starting 2B potential. - 2025 Projection: 19/2/11/.249/.303/.355/7 Prime Projection: 74/10/52/.266/.328/.379/28

82) Brendan Rodgers - FRA, 2B, 28.8 - Rodgers cracks this list almost purely on his past hype, combined with the fact that maybe once he gets out of Colorado, and actually gets into a real organization (we'll see where he lands, if anywhere), maybe there is some kind of untapped upside in here that a good team can pull out. He still hits the ball hard with a 44.1% Hard Hit%, but that is all he does well at this point. He has no speed, below average plate skills, and a below average launch. I guess the thing a good team will try to do is to get him to hit the ball in the air more, and at this point in his career, why not give it a shot. What does he have lose? Let's see where or if he lands somewhere. - 2025 Projection: 60/14/60/.261/.311/.410/1

83) Nacho Alvarez - ATL, SS/3B/2B, 22.0 - Nobody is a bigger Nacho fan than I am. I named him a super deep sleeper in his FYPD class for deep leagues, and seeing him blossom has been fun to watch, but unfortunately, he's still really only a deep league option. The power/speed combo is just far too lackluster with an 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A and below average speed. He's also not a lift and pull guy, so he can't fall back on that either. The hit tool and plate approach are great with a 15.6/12.8 K%/BB% at Triple-A, but that immediately didn't transfer to the majors with a 31.3/0.0 K%/BB% in 32 PA. He was 21 and it's a super small sample, so I'm not giving it too much credence, but considering the below average power/speed combo, that hit tool/approach needs to be bulletproof. It sure looks like a utility player to me, or a low end regular. - 2025 Projection: 11/2/13/.248/.297/.353/2 Prime Projection: 76/13/62/.276/.338/.411/10

84) Mac Horvath - TBR, 2B/3B/OF, 23.8 - Horvath is a lift and pull machine, so it's unsurprising that Tampa was intrigued by him in a mid-season trade, and it's an upgrade to get out of Baltimore's logjam. The hit tool is the real problem though with .229 BA and 25.9% K% in 102 games at High-A, and it got way worse after the trade to Tampa with a 34.6% K% in 31 games. He's an excellent athlete with power and speed, but his K rates have been very high in the lower minors, which is not a great sign for an advanced college bat. If anyone can make it work, it's Tampa, but often a guy like this ends up in a part time role for them in their mid to late 20's, which is only so helpful for fantasy. Still a decent upside shot though if the hit tool can improve. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/16/56/.233/.309/.422/18

85) Devin Saltiban - PHI, 2B, 20.2 -  Saltiban was a 3rd round pick in 2023 who immediately hit well in pro ball. He put up a 124 wRC+ in 10 games at rookie ball in 2023, and then in 2024 he put up a 123 wRC+ with 17 homers, 22 steals and a 24.8/12.2 K%/BB% in 97 games at Single-A. He's not a big guy at 5'9'', 180 pounds, but he's got a quick righty swing and he can lift and pull it a bit. The 86.2 MPH EV isn't too bad for his age, and the 9.7% Barrel shows the power production wasn't a fluke. He also has speed and is a good baserunner, going 22 for 24 on the bases. If the strikeout rate was a bit better, I could see being even higher on him, but I'm a fan. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/17/71/.253/.325/.417/23

86) Mikey Romero - BOS, 2B/SS, 21.3 - Here is what I wrote about Romero in the in-season Dynasty Rundowns towards the end of the season, and my thoughts remain the same: "The Red Sox 1st round pick, 24th overall, in 2022 has been almost completely ignored by everyone, including me, but Mikey is demanding our attention right now after calmly jacking out his 4th homer in 7 games since getting called up to Double-A as a 20 year old. He had 10 homers in 59 games at High-A. The reason he has been ignored is because he doesn't have big raw power, he doesn't have speed (1 steal all season), and his hit tool/plate approach isn't particularly good either with a 21.9/5.0 K%/BB% in 60 games overall. Those deficiencies still make me pretty lackluster on his future potential, but production matters, and the guy is no doubt producing while being super young for the level. Maybe he can lift and pull his way into like Connor Norby type territory." ... He closed out the season at Double-A with 6 homers and a 33.8/2.7 K%/BB% in 16 games. That K rate is scary, but he was just 20 years old getting a taste of the upper minors. It was much better at High-A with a 21% K%. He's getting no love, but the guy was picked 24th overall, he reached Double-A by 20 and showed he can do damage against upper minors pitching. I don't think he's a major dynasty asset either, but show the guy just a little bit of love, will ya. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/17/71/.245/.303/.412/3

87) Cooper Kinney - TBR, 2B, 22.2 - Kinney was the 34th overall pick in 2021 and then missed the entire 2022 season with shoulder surgery. He's just been kinda slowly plodding through the minors since with good but not eye catching production. He slashed .289/.352/.494 with 10 homers, 6 steals, and a 22.2/8.9 K%/BB% in 87 games at High-A this year. It was good for a 137 wRC+. Being 21 years old at High-A is fine, but it's one year older than optimal, and nothing really stands out in his game. He has good size at 6'1'', 200 pounds, and he has a sweet lefty swing, which are the things that got him drafted so highly out of high school, but without a standout tool/skill, he remains kinda lukewarm for fantasy. If he can keep up the production at Double-A, that will give him a bump, and there is definitely potential for a power breakout if he can start to lift and pull more. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 65/18/71/.261/.318/.414/6

88) Ricardo Cabrera - CIN, 3B/2B/SS, 20.5 - I want to like Cabrera more, but a 83.9 MPH EV in 105 games at Single-A is super underwhelming. He was only 19, so I'm not saying he can't improve there, he almost certainly will, it's just a very low starting point, and it's hard to bet on him truly hitting the ball very hard in the future. It's also not like he was that great statistically, slashing .252/.333/..399 with 11 homers, 19 steals, and a 22.1/6.8 K%/BB%. He also had a 50.2% GB%. He was a high priced international signing who has hit well in pro ball, which is why I feel the pull to like him more, but objectively, he's just not that unique or special of a prospect. He's fine. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/15/71/.264/.322/.411/13

89) Jorge Mateo - BAL, 2B, 29.10 - Mateo's season ended in mid July with an elbow injury that eventually needed an internal brace procedure and flexor repair surgery. The injury is likely to keep him out into the beginning of 2025 as well. He's just a utility player these days, and even if injuries hit, there is no guarantee he's in line for full time at bats as Baltimore is pretty deep. If he does find his way into the lineup, his elite speed and base stealing ability will keep him relevant, and he has decent pop, but it comes with terrible plate skills. - 2025 Projection: 42/6/27/.228/.276/.378/22

90) Jeff McNeil - NYM, 2B/OF, 33.0 - McNeil is on his last legs, and while the Mets could go with the vet at 2B, they have so many other good younger options (Acuna, Mauricio, Jett), I just doubt he holds onto the starting job for long even if he does win it. He just had his 2nd straight year of a well below average xwOBA, and he's now 33 years old. He can get the bat on the ball with a 14.4% K% and he plays a solid 2B, but that is about all he does well. He's a desperation option. - 2025 Projection: 44/8/35/.261/.323/.390/5

91) Vaughn Grissom - BOS, 2B, 24.3 - Despite Grissom's hype in previous years, he's settled in as a pretty unexciting player. He looks like a utility infielder who will need a legitimate power uptick in his mid 20's to end up as anything more than that. He was very rough in the majors in 2024 with a 28 wRC+, 0 homers, and 2 steals in 31 games. He wasn't all that good at Triple-A either with a .259/.385/.373 triple-slash in 55 games. He just hits the ball super weakly with a 86.1 MPH EV in the majors and a 85.3 MPH EV in the minors. He's not fast either with a 27.4 ft/sec sprint, and the contact rates are good, but they aren't great with a 21.1% K% in the majors and a 19.2% K% in the minors. He's also not that good on defense. He's 6'2'', 210 pounds, so he theoretically has the size to add more power, but "looking the part" can only get you so far. You need to produce, and Grissom just isn't producing. - 2025 Projection: 18/2/14/.251/.318/.391/5 Prime Projection: 74/14/68/.268/.333/.409/12

92) William Bergolla Jr. - CHW, 2B/SS, 20.5 - I really liked Bergolla's hit/speed/bloodlines combo in his international signing year, and while the hit was most certainly there with elite contact rates, he wasn't running at all. That changed this year with him stealing 27 bags in 33 attempts at High-A. He combined that with a 10.6/8.1 K%/BB%, a .300 BA and a 114 wRC+ in 89 games as a 19 year old. He truly has special contact ability. There is absolutely zero power in here with 1 homer in his entire 168 game career, and he's a small guy without much raw power, so he isn't going to grow into much more either. It's likely a utility infielder profile, but those contact rates are elite, and if he hits his way into the lineup, he should steal enough bases with it to be interesting for fantasy. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/7/38/.283/.332/.371/23

93) Emelien Pitre - TBR, 2B, 22.6 - Selected 58th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Pitre is a lower upside infielder who is probably a better real life prospect than fantasy, but that's not to say there is no fantasy intrigue. He's 5'11'' with some room to tack on a bit more mass, and he had a power breakout his junior year with 10 dingers in 62 games in the SEC (1 was his previous career high). A strong plate approach and speed is what you are buying, and that immediately transferred to pro ball, slashing .299/.402/.403 with 0 homers, 7 steals, and a 12.0/13.0 K%/BB% in 21 games at Single-A. He can hit the ball hard, but it's geared more for all fields line drives, so there isn't big upside in here. He likely profiles as one of Tampa's many moving parts, part time players down the line. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/10/51/.262/.323/.393/15

94) Franyerber Montillo - DET, 2B/SS/3B, 19.11 - I'm not sure Montillo deserves to crack this list after how hard he struggled once he got the call to Single-A. He was already 19 years old, so seeing him put up a 42 wRC+ with a 31.6% K% in 20 games is not a good sign. He looked really good in rookie ball with a 136 wRC+ and above average across the board production, but those numbers don't look as impressive after the immediate drop off at the more age appropriate Single-A. The reason he does crack this list though is because I just like the look of him at the plate. He's a pretty electric player at 6'0'' with some power and athleticism. He can also lift and pull it, so he should be able to get the most out of his power. And he's walked a ton in his career, even at Single-A with a 15.2% BB% at that level. I'll give him a pass for the struggles in full season ball because it's not like he was ancient at a relatively recently turned 19, and regardless of age, there is an adjustment period humans often have to make to tougher levels, new teams, cities, coaches etc ... Hard to say he's too sought after of a prospect, but there is something here that I definitely like a lot when watching him. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/17/66/.250/.330/.418/18

95) Larry Suero - COL, 2B/3B, 17.0 - Suero is 6'2'', 182 pounds with a sweet lefty swing, a good feel to hit, and good athleticism. Signing with Colorado is a double edged sword, as you get their ballpark at the end of the road, but you also get their poor development on the way to that. There isn't a ton of video out there on him, and he seems probably 14/15 years old in the video I have seen, but even the younger version of him had an athletic and sweet lefty swing, so it's not hard to envision legit offensive upside at 6'2''. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/22/79/.268/.334/.447/10

96) Jadher Areinamo - MIL, 2B/SS/3B, 21.4 - Areinamo is probably a utility infielder long term with one of the wackiest swings I've ever seen. I imagine if they ever drew Micky Mouse playing baseball, they would have him swing something like Areinamo. It's amazing that he has elite contact rates with that swing, but he does with a 11.1% K% and .301 BA in 110 games at High-A. He doesn't have big raw power with only 10 homers at 5'8", and he's not a burner despite 32 steals, so I don't think his fantasy value is huge. But if the elite contact rates stick in the upper minors, he'll be interesting for deeper leagues. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/9/42/.268/.321/.387/16

97) Gage Miller - MIA, 3B/2B, 22.1 - Selected 92nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Miller was a standout Junior College player in his freshman and sophomore years, and then he transferred into the SEC and kept on raking, slashing .381/.474/.702 with 18 homers, 0 steals, and a 24/27 K/BB in 55 games. If he had a good pro debut, I could see liking him more, but his debut was rough, slashing .240/.305/.298 with 0 homers, 2 steals, and a 16.9/5.9 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's not a particularly toolsy guy and he's not particularly physical at 6'0'', 200 pounds. His strong amateur production and decent draft slot gets him on the list, but he's not a very interesting fantasy prospect right now. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 45/12/45/.253/.318/.402/4

98) Carlos Renzullo - COL, 2B/OF, 18.6 - Renzullo is one of the top hit/speed breakouts in the DSL, slashing .360/.455/.447 with 1 homer, 18 steals, and a 6.0%/14.0% K%/BB% in 50 games. There isn't big power here at 5'8'' with high groundball rates, and often with these types the hit tool will just keeping getting a bit worse at every level, leaving them with a pretty lackluster speed and not much else profile. But if you want to take a shot on a DSL contact/speed play, Renzullo is not a bad shot. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 72/9/55/.273/.328/.385/27
