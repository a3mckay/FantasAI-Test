Hitters

Parker Meadows - DET, OF, 25.5 - If you would have told me that Meadows would put up a 111 wRC+ last off-season when I named him a major target, I would have assumed he was going to be a major hit for me, but we all know it wasn't quite that easy. He struggled hard in his first 32 games with a .096 BA, which resulted in him getting banished back to the minors. Depending on the league, many people probably dropped him or sold low by that time, and I sure as hell already given all my mea culpas and my bads on naming him a target. But he didn't hang his head when he got sent down, putting up a 130 wRC+ in 51 games, and then he carried that over when he got called back up to the majors, slashing .300/.344/.513 with 7 homers, 6 steals, and a 20.7/6.6 K%/BB% in his final 50 games (plus a 131 wRC+ with 3 steals and 1 homer in 7 playoff games). The same profile I loved last off-season is still present with a 18.6 degree launch, 29.3 ft/sec sprint, 27% whiff%, and 25.8% Chase%. He's also a plus CF. The one problem is that he doesn't hit the ball very hard. He had a 87/91.6 MPH AVG/LD EV with a 37.3% Hard Hit%. Even during his hot 2nd half he wasn't hitting the ball all that hard. It's a recipe for a low batting average, but the homer/steal combo has enough upside to make up for it. While it doesn't feel right to say Meadows was a hit in 2024, it also doesn't feel right to say he was a miss. I'll call it a draw, and we'll let 2025 break the tie, because I'm definitely still in on him. Let's run it back ... 2025 Projection: 82/20/71/.248/.320/.432/23

Riley Greene - DET, OF, 24.6 - With how volatile development can be, it's always nice when a talented prospect has a nice and smooth upward trajectory. Greene put up a 98 wRC+ in 2022, a 121 wRC+ in 2023 and finally a 135 wRC+ in 2024. He raised his launch (12.2 degrees), improved his whiff% (26.8%) and improved his Chase% (23.1%). That is all he needed to explode with how hard he hit the ball already (13.4% Barrel% with a 91.3 MPH EV) and how fast he swung the bat (elite 74.5 MPH swing). He slashed .262/.348/.479 with 24 homers, 4 steals, and a 26.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 137 games. Even if this is where he tops out, that would be a very good player, but I think he has at least one more level in him. I would be surprised if he can't get that strikeout rate down into the low 20's at true peak, resulting in several seasons of plus to double plus hit/power production. He's an easy Top 50 dynasty asset. 2025 Projection: 86/28/92/.276/.359/.498/7

Colt Keith - DET, 2B, 23.8 - Keith's rookie year was so average across the board it almost makes it not average because of how average it was. It was uniquely average. He had an about average 97 wRC+ with an about average .313 xwOBA, an about average 23.2% whiff%, an about average 29.9% Chase%, and an about average 71.3 MPH swing.. Really all of his numbers are in that average range, slashing .260/.309/.380 with 13 homers, 7 steals, and a 19.8/6.5 K%/BB% in 148 games. His 87.8 MPH EV was a bit below average and his 27.7 ft/sec sprint was a bit above average. For a 22 year old, that is almost the textbook definition of "setting a solid foundation." He's right on track to be an at least above average MLB hitter, and there is ceiling for him to possibly become one of the better all around hitters in the game if he can take that same developmental path as Riley Greene did. 2025 Projection: 72/19/76/.265/.324/.430/7 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.278/.342/.476/9

Kerry Carpenter - DET, OF, 27.7 - Carpenter was a major target for me last off-season, writing, "Carpenter has a pretty rare, very hard to find profile that can usually only be found at the top of drafts, but he gets valued like a boring afterthought. He had a 10.2% Barrel%, 90.1/95.1 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch, 28.1 ft/sec sprint, and 27% whiff%. I promise you, those are not easy numbers to find." ...  I knew that collection of skills was special, and then he went out and proved it in 2024 with a .385 xwOBA, .932 OPS, and 18 homers in 87 games. And the underlying numbers looked even better this year with a 17.7% Barrel%, 90.5/94.9 MPH AVG/FB EV, 17.6 degree launch, 27.7 ft/sec sprint, and 30.3% whiff%. That whiff% is higher than optimal, he was atrocious vs. lefties (.408 OPS in only 32 PA, meaning he was platooning), and he's not a good defensive player, so he has his warts, but I'll say it again, this is a very impressive hitting profile. Even in a platoon role, he could very easily hit 30+ bombs next year, and I'm not so sure his bat is going to get relegated to a strict platoon role. 2025 Projection: 76/30/91/.262/.320/.506/5

Pitchers

Tarik Skubal - DET, LHP, 28.4 - I was all in on Skubal's 80.1 IP explosion in 2023, ranking him 59th overall on the 2024 Top 1,000, and placing a futures bet on him to lead the league in strikeouts ($10 to win $800). He not only led all of baseball with 228 strikeouts, but he was also the #1 fantasy pitcher in the game with a 2.39 ERA and 30.3/4.6 K%/BB% in 192 IP. His 96.8 MPH fastball was up another tick from last year and was the 4th most valuable 4-seamer in the game. His changeup is elite with a 46.1% whiff%. His 96.6 MPH sinker was the 24th most valuable sinker in baseball. And his slider was above average. Tack on elite control and you have one of the very best pitchers in baseball. It really wouldn't be crazy at all to have him above Skenes as the top dog. 2025 Projection: 16/2.82/0.96/220 in 185 IP

Detroit Tigers Top 10 2025 Fantasy Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Max Clark - DET, OF, 20.3 - Clark was the 3rd overall pick in a stacked 2023 draft class, and he played exactly as advertised in his first full season of pro ball, slashing .279/.372/.421 with 9 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.2/12.4 K%/BB% in 107 games split between Single-A (134 wRC+) and High-A (119 wRC+). He's an absolutely electric player when you watch him with a vicious lefty swing and plus speed. He's already one of the more exciting top of the order prospects in the lower minors, and when gains more power naturally, and starts lifting the ball a bit more (48% GB%), he can explode into a truly elite prospect. His hype has actually been relatively subdued considering how much pre draft hype he got, but make no mistake, Clark can be special. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 96/20/69/.277/.351/.443/30

2) Jackson Jobe - DET, RHP, 22.8 - I love Jobe. He's definitely an elite pitching prospect. But there are a few other truly elite pitching prospects in the minors right now (Jobe, Schultz, Bubba, Kumar), and Jobe's 25.6/12.0 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP at mostly Double-A just isn't as impressive as theirs. It came with a 2.34 ERA, and the stuff is filthy with a 97 MPH plus fastball and 3 potentially plus secondaries in his sweeper, changeup, and cutter, so he's right there with all of them, he just doesn't hold down the stop spot right now. Or the top 2. I have him 3rd behind Schultz and Bubba, but there is no shame in that game as Schultz and Bubba are top of the rotation starters themselves with equally as nasty stuff. Jobe should break camp with the team in 2025, and while I wouldn't expect an ace season right out of the gate, I'm betting on him getting there eventually. 2025 Projection: 8/3.83/1.27/136 in 140 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.08/207 in 180 IP

3) Kevin McGonigle - DET, SS, 20.7 - McGonigle had one of the best hit tools in the high school class, and while this is generally a bucket of prospect that I don't go after in first year player drafts, McGonigle showed what it looks like when that profile goes right. He slashed .309/.401/.452 with 5 homers, 22 steals, and a 8.5/14.0 K%/BB% in 74 games split between Single-A and High-A. He proved he wasn't just hit tool though, hitting the ball pretty hard with a 88.9 MPH EV at Single-A, and also showing base stealing skills (22 for 24 on the bases). He didn't have any groundball issues and he pulled the ball a lot (well over 50% pull rate). Even during the regular season I got too locked into him as a hit tool guy, when there is more to his skillset than that. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10", 187 pounds, and I still see more of a moderate power/speed combo, so I still don't mind my Stevan Kwan 2.0 comp, but McGonigle is already hitting the ball harder (and pulling the ball a lot more), so he can end up a souped up version of Kwan. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 92/15/58/291/.362/.422/21

4) Josue Briceno - DET, C/1B, 20.6 - As the world's foremost expert on Josue's, I presented you with the first zero hype Josue to pick up as quick as possible in 2022 (Josue De Paula), and then knowing a good Josue when I see one, I did the same for the 2nd zero hype Josue in 2023 (Josue Briceno). Both of their hypes have grown considerably since then, and if not for a knee sprain knocking out 2 and a half months of Briceno's season, his hype could have been even more. But he's making up for lost time right now in the AFL, putting up MVP worthy numbers with 7 homers and a 1.430 OPS in 16 games. Even with the knee injury and not really having a good regular season, he still ended up with a 123 wRC+, 89.8 MPH EV and 14.8/12.5 K%/BB% in 40 games at Single-A. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with a potentially special hit/power combo. He's likely a 1B long term, which is perfect for his type of bat. Even with his profile rising, it's still not enough. He remains a major target for me this off-season. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.275/.350/.488/3

5) Bryce Rainer - DET, SS, 19.9 - Selected 11th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Rainer is your classic "looks the part" prospect at 6'3'', 195 pounds with a smooth lefty swing, plus power potential, plus athleticism, and good glove at SS. Corey Seager and Kyle Tucker would be the absolute ceiling comps, while Colson Montgomery would be a more recent comp. Like Montgomery, Rainer is older for his class at 19 years old already, and his hit tool isn't a slam dunk either quite yet. Come to think of it, Riley Greene might actually be the perfect comp here, and Detroit has done a great job developing Greene. Detroit got their SS version of Greene (although Greene was a slightly more touted prospect in his draft year, so he would be close to a ceiling comp as well). - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/25/88/.263/.336/.470/12

6) Trey Sweeney - DET, SS, 24.11 - Sweeney was one of my favorite proximity stashes during the 2024 season, even moving him into my Top 100 at some point, and his MLB debut just emboldened my love for him. He's 6'3'', 212 pounds with a 74.1 MPH swing which is in double plus territory. It resulted in a 91.1 MPH EV with a 12.8 degree launch. His 28.1 ft/sec sprint speed is above average to plus, stealing 16 bags in 96 games at Triple-A and 3 bags in 43 games in the majors (including the playoffs). He was also a plus defender at SS. This is a pretty special athlete here. His .642 OPS in 36 games isn't super impressive, he didn't exactly dominate Triple-A with a 88 wRC+, and there is hit tool risk with a 32.4% whiff%. But all of those are more than baked into his price, overly so in my opinion. My attention is on the things he does well, and that makes him a very enticing target relative to his perceived value. 2025 Projection: 71/18/76/.237/.308/.416/11 Prime Projection: 83/22/78/.252/.328/.444/14

7) Jace Jung - DET, 3B, 24.6 - I called Jung a good prospect to use as trade bait, instead of one you hold before he made his MLB debut this year, and his poor debut showed why. He hit 0 homers with 0 steals, an 86.4 MPH EV, a 26 ft/sec sprint speed, and a 30.9% K%. It's not that I don't think he can be a solid MLB hitter, and his 102 wRC+ and 16% BB% shows very clearly that he can be a solid MLB hitter, it's just that there isn't big fantasy upside. He doesn't hit the ball hard, he's slow, and the hit tool is below average. He can lift and pull it, but both his lift and pull plummeted in the majors, and while that should improve, it's not the best sign. He's also a bad defensive player and he put up a .649 OPS vs. lefties in the minors. His best skill is that he walks a lot, so add a star in OBP leagues, but in general, Jung is not one of my guys. 2025 Projection: 72/15/65/.238/.318/.402/2 Prime Projection: 82/20/76/.254/.343/.440/3

8) Thayron Liranzo - DET, C, 21.9 - The trade to Detroit must have lit a fire under Liranzo, because he went from hitting 7 homers with a .700 OPS in 74 games at High-A for LA, to jacking out 5 homers with a 1.031 OPS in 26 games for Detroit. He's also decimating the AFL with a 1.171 OPS in 10 games. He came over in the Jack Flaherty trade along with Trey Sweeney, so you know Detroit loved this kid, and he proved them correct very quickly. He's a big boy at 6'2'' with a powerful swing from both sides of the plate. He's not a lock to stick behind the plate, but he has the bat to profile at 1B/DH, and I don't think Detroit makes this trade if they thought he couldn't stick there. Detroit doesn't have a strong organizational catcher depth chart at all, so they have every reason to stick with him there. He profiles as your classic low BA slugging catcher if he sticks. He's less exciting as a 1B/DH prospect, but still not a bad prospect there either. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/24/73/.242/.323/.460/2

9) Sawyer Gipson-Long - DET, RHP, 27.4 - Gipson-Long underwent an internal brace procedure (or possibly Tommy John, it's not entirely clear) in April after his first outing of the season, and then he also underwent hip surgery in July. He's expected to be out until mid-season 2025, and it sure seems like he has a lot to come back from. I get writing him off until he proves he is healthy, as he was never a hyped pitching prospect either. But it's hard to write him off when you remember how good he was in his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 2.70 ERA with a 31.7/9.8 K%/BB% in 20 IP. His 35.0% whiff%, even in a small sample, is very impressive. His slider and changeup were untouchable and the 93.6 MPH 4-seamer and 92.4 MPH sinker performed well too. If he does get healthy, and if he can pick up from 2023, he definitely has impact fantasy starter upside. At this point in the rankings, I think it's worth hanging onto him. 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.33/38 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.24/152 in 140 IP

10) Jaden Hamm - DET, RHP, 22.7 - Hamm was one of the top statistical breakout pitchers in the minors with a 2.64 ERA and 30.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 99 IP. And he's not just stats, he has the talent to back it up with a plus low to mid 90's fastball and plus slider, to go along with an average change and curve. He combines that with about average control. He never made it to Double-A for even a cup of coffee, and I would really like to see how the profile plays against upper minors hitters before really flying him up the rankings, because I have a feeling that K rate is coming down against better competition. I see more #3/4 fantasy starter upside, but if his control/command takes a step forward, or he gains more velocity, or the changeup takes a step forward, he can beat that projection. 2025 Projection: 1/4.35/1.34/24 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.90/1.25/160 in 160 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Not so much a strategy or thought here, but the more I think about it, the more I'm kinda digging Sawyer Gipson Long. He very well might be freely available in many leagues, and you might be able to use an IL spot on him too depending on your league setup. Or just as a free stash in your minors. His MLB debut was no joke. That type of swing and miss is quite rare, even in 20 IP. His 28.5/6.1 K%/BB% in 341 minor league IP is really damn impressive too. He never got the respect he deserved, even from me, and even after that strong debut. I think a lot of people have more or less moved on from him, making it a perfect time to acquire him for nothing or probably almost nothing. If fully healthy, which is obviously a risk, it could be an extremely small gamble for a pretty big payoff.
