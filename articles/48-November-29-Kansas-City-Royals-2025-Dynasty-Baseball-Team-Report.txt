Hitters

Vinnie Pasquantino - KCR, 1B, 27.6 - As much as I want to keep calling for the big Vinnie breakout, and as enticing the contact/EV combo is, he now has 1,112 career PA with a slightly above average 7.6% Barrel%. It's actually declined every year of his career, so you can't even say it's headed in the right direction. His home ballpark is straight up death on lefty homers with a 68 HR Statcast Value. That HR Park factor is by far the worst for both lefty and righty splits (a 72 for Giants righties is next to last). While he crushes the ball with a 91 MPH EV, his FB/LD EV's haven't been nearly as impressive with a 92 MPH FB/LD EV in 2022, a 92.1 MPH mark in 2023, and finally a 93.7 MPH mark in 2024. That 2024 mark is his best yet, and he did close out his season by hitting 8 homers in his final 27 games before going down with a thumb injury that required surgery. If not for the injury, he was on pace to hit 20+ homers. If he played in a better ballpark for lefty homers, his 12.8% K%, 14.6 degree launch, and 47.2% Pull% might be capable of putting up some truly special seasons, but in the very worst park for lefty homers by far, it seems mid 20's is a fair expectation. And hopefully that thumb surgery doesn't keep popping up in 2025. 2025 Projection: 73/24/92/.269/.333/.455/1

Maikel Garcia - KCR, 3B, 25.1 - Garcia was a major target for me last off-season, and while he didn't have the game power breakout I thought was possible, and despite being very unlucky, he still finished 115th overall on the Razzball Player Rater, which is better than I expected considering the disappointing season. His 37 steals were the 7th most in baseball, and he only got caught 2 times. He hit only .231, but with a 16.5% K% and 90.4 MPH EV, that is so clearly the result of bad luck (.260 xBA). He didn't make any attempts to unlock more game power with a low launch and low pull rate, so that just might not be an adjustment he's interested in making. He's entering his mid 20's, and I do still think a game power uptick is possible, but it's hard to count on it. He's an above average defensive player at 3B and he doesn't have much competition for the job, so all indications are that KC is going to run it back with Garcia in 2025, but it's likely to come at the bottom of the order this year, especially after the India trade. I can't say he's a major target for me this off-season, and while I lean calling him a miss, maybe a neutral is more accurate. He's settling in as a contact/speed play, but the high EV gives him just enough of an upside boost to stay interesting. 2025 Projection: 76/10/64/.266/.320/.382/29

Pitchers

Cole Ragans - KCR, LHP, 27.4 - Ragans proved without a shadow of a doubt that his 2nd half 2023 breakout was 100% legit. He was a legit ace for the entire season in 2024, and most importantly, he stayed healthy all year. He put up a 3.14 ERA with a 29.3/8.8 K%/BB% in 186.1 IP. The 32% whiff% was elite and the control was average, which is all he needs to let his explosive stuff do the rest. His 95.4 MPH fastball was the 8th most valuable fastball in baseball with a +16 Run Value. His double plus changeup was the 15th most valuable changeup in the game, putting up a 47.8% whiff%. The slider and curve were both plus, bat missing weapons, and he throws a useful cutter too. The only deficiency is that his control was merely average and not plus, which puts him slightly below the true top aces, but not by much. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.28/1.13/218 in 185 IP

Brady Singer - CIN, RHP, 28.8 - I know that Singer isn't a Royal anymore, but I already did the Reds team list, and Singer is an interesting pitcher to talk about. For me, it's mostly talking about how I'm not buying into the 3.71 ERA in 179.2 IP at all, and now with his move to one of the worst pitcher's parks in the league, I'm not going near him with a ten foot pole. He was already regressing hard to close out the season with a 5.60 ERA in his final 54.2 IP, and the 4.65 xERA tells you to be highly mistrustful of that season ERA. Both his sinker and slider, his two most used pitches by far, got lucky last year and grade out as more average to slightly above average pitches. It's not there is nothing to like, I just see him as a #4 type. Singer's 92.2 MPH sinker was the 7th most valuable sinker in baseball last year, and with Cincinnati's small ballpark, the ability to keep the ball low will only help (career 8.5 degree launch against). The slider can miss bats with a 35.4% whiff%, and the walk rate is above average with a 7.1% BB%. If he had stuck with Kansas City, I could see a case to think he could be a solid mid rotation starter, but with the move to Cincy, he just doesn't have the upside (22.3% K%) to take on that ballpark hit. I'm avoiding him. 2025 Projection: 9/4.16/1.31/160 in 170 IP

Bullpen

Lucas Erceg - KCR, Closer, 29.11 - I was relatively high on Erceg last off-season, ranking him pretty high among non closers, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "Erceg could factor into the saves mix, and he has the big stuff to make an impact if his control can take one step forward. The sinker sat 98 MPH and is a plus, bat missing pitch, to go along with two good bat missing secondaries in his slider and changeup. He got drafted as a hitter in 2016, and only got transitioned to a pitcher in 2021, so there could more upside in the tank here than your average 28 year old." ... not only did his control take one step forward, it took 8 steps forward, improving his walk rate 8 percentage points to a well above average 6.3%. It led to a full on breakout with a 3.36 ERA and a 28.5% K%, culminating with him taking over the full time closer job with Kansas City after he got traded there at the deadline. He throws a devasting 4 pitch mix with two upper 90's fastball and 2 bat missing secondaries. He maintained the control gains all season too, which gives confidence that he can maintain a least a large portion of those gains. He won't come dirt cheap or anything, but he's a great option if you don't want to pay up too much for the already established elite closers, and I guess there is a possibility for him to be transitioned back into a starter, which would be awesome (but I haven't heard any plans to do that). 2025 Projection: 4/3.30/1.11/76/30 saves in 64 IP

Kansas City Royals 2025 Top 10 Dynasty Fantasy Baseball Prospects

1) Jac Caglionone - KCR, 1B, 22.2 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Caglionone's pro debut was on the disappointing side, and with how tightly packed the talent is in the FYPD Top 10, he's sliding down my rankings towards the bottom of that Top 10 area. He had hit tool and chase questions coming out of the draft, and hitting .241 with a 20.6/5.6 K%/BB% in his 29 game pro debut at High-A did nothing to quell those issues. He put up a lowly 94 wRC+ with 2 homers, which isn't what you want to see from an elite college bat in the lower minors. He then went to the AFL where the pitching was so bad this year, they are actively trying to figure out how to improve the pitchers in that league in future years, and he still couldn't dominate with a .749 OPS in 21 games. Tons of hitters were putting up just wacky numbers in that extreme offensive environment. He did jack 5 homers, and there is zero doubt about his massive power, so there is no doubt he has a carrying tool even if the hit tool and plate approach take time to adjust to pro pitching. He's built like an NFL tight end at 6'5'', 250 pounds, and he obliterated the SEC with 75 homers in 165 career games. It took him some time to improve his plate skills in college as well, making big improvements his junior year with a 8.2/18.4 K%/BB% (18.2/5.3 K%/BB% his sophomore year), so the hope is that he can do the same in the majors. KC's ballpark is death to lefty homers, and while I am factoring that in a bit, he has the type of power to not get too hung up on it. Even though the pro debut does have him sliding down the rankings a bit, it's almost more because of how much comparable college talent there is at the top of this class to begin with. He's still a very exciting power bat. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/32/96/.251/.332/.503/6

2) Blake Mitchell - KCR, C, 20.8 - It was a bit of a head scratcher when the Royals selected Mitchell 8th overall, and while I still question the pick a bit, Mitchell proved he is an excellent catcher prospect in his first full year of pro ball. He slashed .238/.376/.439 with 18 homers, 25 steals, and a 30.5/17.0 K%/BB% in 106 games at Single-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+. He has a quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to lift and pull, giving him considerable power upside at peak, and while he's not a burner, the 25 steals show how good of an athlete he is. He should at least chip in there. Of course, the big question is the hit tool. If he can just get to below average, he can be your classic low BA slugging catcher, but there is no guarantee he can get to that. Add a star in OBP leagues because he walks a ton, but the hit tool is going to have to show improvement no matter what. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/25/74/.227/.314/.438/9

3) Gavin Cross - KC, OF, 24.2 - Cross bounced back in 2024 from a disappointing first full year of pro ball, slashing .261/.342/.428 with 15 homers, 30 steals, and a 24.1/10.3 K%/BB% in 101 games at Double-A. It was good for a 115 wRC+. It certainly has his value back on the rise, and while this isn't the player many were hoping to see after getting selected 9th overall, there is still an intriguing power/speed combo in here for fantasy. He doesn't smash the ball, but the raw power is solid, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's not a burner, but he has speed, and he's been an excellent base stealer throughout his career, going 30 for 32 this year. The two biggest issues are that the hit tool is below average, and KC is absolutely death (dead last) for lefty homers. It seems like a recipe for a low BA and limited homers. If Cross played in a different park, I might be enticed by the profile, but in KC, I'm a little worried it's going to be lackluster. 2025 Projection: 19/5/24/.221/.298/.391/7 Prime Projection: 74/18/76/.242/.318/.421/18

4) Carter Jensen - KCR, C, 21.9 - The unheralded Jensen continued to rake his face off everywhere he's played, and it's high time we start heralding him. He put up a 137 wRC+ in 84 games at High-A, and then he got the call to Double-A where he put up a 112 wRC+ with 8 homers in 41 games. He obliterated the AFL too with a silly 1.382 OPS and 4 homers in 12 games, but granted, I think I could have put up a 1.000+ OPS against AFL pitching this year. He hits the ball very hard, he has no groundball issues, and he can pull it. He's a legit exciting power bat with a howitzer lefty swing, but it comes with legit hit tool risk too. He hit .233 with a 26.5/8.8 K%/BB% when he got to Double-A, and he has a career .235 BA in 373 minor league games. He walks a ton, so add a star in OBP leagues, but the hit tool still needs to take a step forward to be a slam dunk starting MLB catcher. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/22/68/.232/.317/.435/5

5) Steven Zobac - KCR, RHP, 24.5 - Zobac might be one of the more underrated pitchers in the minors right now as he checks a solid amount of boxes. He certainly looks the part at an athletic 6'3'', 185 pounds. His stuff is good with a low to mid 90's fastball that has a great movement profile and is a bat missing weapon, to go along with an above average slider and solid changeup. And he has plus control over the entire arsenal. The final box is that he has upper minors production too with a 3.25 ERA and 28.6/6.2 K%/BB% in 55.1 IP at Double-A. He wasn't quite as good at High-A with a 3.95 ERA and 20.0/5.2 K%/BB% in 70.2 IP, so I would temper expectations a bit, but there is a lot to like here. He definitely falls into that pitching prospect bucket that I like to take shots in, but Zobac is still probably more for medium to deeper leagues than shallower ones right now. 2025 Projection: 1/4.30/1.32/35 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.05/1.25/154 in 160 IP

6) Austin Charles - KCR, 3B/SS, 21.4 - Charles was a super raw, super talented project at an uber athletic 6'5'' coming into 2024, and he more or less heads into 2025 with that exact same profile. He was 20 years old and repeating Single-A, which is never a great sign, and while he had a much better season this year with a 121 wRC+, the .257/.353/.386 triple slash with a 25.8% K% and 10 homers in 117 games doesn't exactly look great. You only have to watch him swing the bat once with an insanely athletic, quick, and powerful righty swing to overlook the lackluster statistical profile, and he can certainly lift and pull it with a 35.2% GB% and 60.1% Pull%, so he should be able to get to most of his power down the line. He also has plus speed with 36 steals. The real question is the hit tool, and while it seems the odds are against him hitting enough to be a full time regular, the upside would be considerable if he can figure it out. He continues to hover in that Top 200-ish area for me as a high risk, high reward lotto ticket. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/18/74/.233/.308/.423/19

7) Noah Cameron - KCR, LHP, 25.8 - Cameron is probably your classic back end, crafty lefty with a 92.2 MPH fastball that gets decent movement and has some bat missing ability, but it's not one of those low 90's fastballs to get really excited about. It's the plus control and plus changeup that has been befuddling upper minors hitters, and we know that profile can often stall in the majors. Regardless, he's knocking on the door of the bigs, and the upper minors production is certainly there with a 3.08 ERA and 27.8/6.7 K%BB% in 128.2 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A. He also throws a solid curve and cutter, giving him a starter's pitch mix. I wouldn't completely rule out of a mid rotation outcome, but considering his age and stuff, that seems like the very, very high end. 2025 Projection: 2/4.38/1.35/52 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.11/1.28/143 in 160 IP

8) Ramon Ramirez - KCR, C, 19.10 - Ramirez was a popular DSL breakout target last off-season, and while his numbers fell off in stateside rookie ball, he still had a good season, slashing .265/.379/.459 with 7 homers, 1 steal, and a 20.7/12.8 K%/BB% in 49 games. He has a strong, quick and athletic righty swing that mostly certainly passes the eye test, and he has the big pop to back that up. There is hit tool risk, he's been on the old side for the level the past 2 seasons, and there is no guarantee he sticks at catcher, but he has plenty of development time to go, and his impressive swing/power potential makes him an exciting young prospect to at least keep an eye on. What he does in full season ball will swing his value in a major way in either direction. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 62/21/69/.246/.318/.440/3

9) David Shields - KCR, LHP, 18.7 - Selected 41st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Shields is a very athletic 6'2'', 210 pounds who was an excellent high school quarterback as well. He has a smooth lefty swing too even though his future is definitely on the mound, but it does show the type of athlete he is. You can see that athleticism on the mound with a lefty delivery that is easy to dream on, especially since he was one of the youngest players in the draft. The stuff isn't quite as exciting yet with a low 90's fastball and 3 still developing secondaries (slider, curve, changeup), but he throws a ton of strikes, and it's so easy to project improvement on all of his pitches. There is definitely nice upside in here if the velocity ticks up and he refines the secondaries, but there is also a long way to go. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.16/1.27/145 in 150 IP

10) Drew Beam - KCR, RHP, 22.1 - Selected 76th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Beam is a floor over upside college starter who should move through the system quickly. Plus control is his best attribute, putting up a 6.5% BB% in his 262.2 IP college career in the SEC, and he was throwing strikes the second he stepped on campus as a freshman. He also most certainly looks the part at an athletic 6'4', 208 pounds. The career 3.60 ERA and 22.7% K% isn't as impressive as the size and walk rates, and his stuff is more in the average to above average category than truly standout with two 94 MPH fastballs, a curve and a changeup. It's a #4 upside type profile, as you can see from falling to 76th overall in the draft, and the lack of strikeouts subdues his upside for fantasy too. The deeper the league, the more value he has. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.21/1.29/130 in 150 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Considering it's Thanksgiving break, I thought it would be fitting to use this section to give a MONSTER thank you to each and every one of you. When I started Imaginary Brick Wall back in December 2015, I had absolutely zero expectations, other than I wanted to write about what I loved, and hoped that I would attract readers that had those same passions. I wrote (and podcasted) for free for 5 years, and while I only got a few hundred views when I first started, even that was insanely cool to me. In my book, that meant I could officially call myself a writer! I again had zero expectations when I started the Patreon in 2021, and I can't put my gratitude into words to see how many people wanted to support my work. It truly means so much to me, and I never take it for granted. I pour my passion and heart into every single piece of content I put out, and I will continue to do that until the day I hang up the keyboard, which will hopefully be never. I want to write until the day I leave this Earth, and thank you so much for allowing me to do that.
