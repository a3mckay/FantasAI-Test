1) Jose Ramirez - CLE, 3B, 32.6 - Ramirez had the quietest 39/41 season of all time. Barely heard about it. The pomp and circumstance around Ohtani was too loud for anyone else to get their fair due. Or maybe it's because he doesn't play in a large market that Ramriez' entire spectacular career doesn't really get the respect he deserves. He's only 5'9''. He doesn't smash the ball like the true giants of the game. He doesn't have elite speed. He doesn't swing the fastest bat. He's an everyman who quietly goes about his business with elite season after elite season. He does it with elite contact skills (12% K%), elite lift (19.6 degree launch) and elite pull ability (52.8% Pull%). He also hits the ball plenty hard with an 89.2 MPH EV. The only question is how long can he do it for at 32 years old. He obviously showed zero signs of slowing down in 2024, and like I mentioned in the Aaron Judge blurb, 33 years old is really the first year I start to seriously consider selling elite players like this. I'm not going to dock him for his age too much. He's an elite win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 102/33/106/.280/.344/.520/33

2) Jazz Chisholm - NYY, 3B/OF, 27.2 - I ranked Jazz 34th overall on the 2024 Top 1,000, absolutely refusing to fade a player with such a beastly power/speed combo, and named him a major target, writing, "Buy the injury discount. His proven upside is way way way too high to let your fear control you. He was on a 30/30 pace this year. The hit tool isn't great, but he has 1,193 PA with a .245 BA. That is a large enough sample where I'm not too worried about the bottom falling out. If you want to shy away from mediocre talents due to injury concern, that is fine with me. Even shying away from good talents is reasonable. But you don't shy away from near elite talents like Chisholm." And what he just did in 2024 is why you don't fade this kind of talent. He slashed .256/.324/.436 with 24 homers, 40 steals, and a 24.5/8.5 K%/BB% in 147 games. He was playing well with the Marlins, but he exploded when he got the Yanks with 11 homers, 18 steals and a 132 wRC+ in 46 games. It's not even that he hit particularly well at Yankee Stadium, it just seemed to light a fire under him, but for sure it's also a big home field upgrade for him. And the most important thing of all is that he stayed healthy. Health is the main reason why people faded him, and unfortunately, it still has to be taken into account in his price. Staying healthy one season is good, but he needs to go back to back healthy seasons for me to take "injury risk" off his resume, or at least have it downplayed. We saw Robert stay basically healthy in 2023, only to again miss a large chunk of the season in 2024. Jazz could easily follow that same path. - 2025 Projection: 87/25/84/.252/.323/.455/33

3) Austin Riley - ATL, 3B, 28.1 - Riley seemingly had a down year on the surface with a 116 wRC+ in 110 games, but there is not a single thing to be worried about. His .366 xwOBA was much better than his .338 wOBA, and was in the top 8% of baseball. He was also in the midst of bringing up his season numbers to career norms with a .942 OPS in his last 57 games before his regular season ended with a right hand fracture in mid August. His 93.3 MPH EV and 53.4% Hard Hit% were actually career highs by a good margin, so he's never hit the ball harder. Have zero concern about Riley moving forward. He'll do his usual .275 BA with 35 homer thing in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 96/34/94/.273/.339/.513/2

4) Rafael Devers - BOS, 3B, 28.5 - Devers is consistently one of easiest evaluations in the game. He consistently smashes the ball with elite EV and a swing that is geared for both power and average. You can bank on about .270+/30+ every single year. Just call him Dollar Bill Devers, because you can take him to the bank. But there is one thing sticking in my craw this year, which is that he battled shoulder issues in both shoulders this season. His season ended in late September with shoulder inflammation. There was no structural damage and he won't require surgery, but shoulders are damn important for hitting, and it's a concern that this shoulder "inflammation" can keep popping up down the line. He's going to be 28 next year, which is still smack dab in his prime, but he is starting to creep up there a bit. I'm not dinging him too much for it, but it's why he's not ranked 10 spots higher on the overall dynasty rankings. - 2025 Projection: 90/31/98/.274/.354/.510/3

5) Junior Caminero - TBR, 3B, 21.9 - Caminero swings the 9th fastest bat in baseball at 77.2 MPH. He hits the ball very, very hard with a 93.3 MPH EV at Triple-A, and a 89.7 MPH EV, 11.8% Barrel%, and a 45.7% Hard Hit% in the majors. And the best part of all is that he's had above average strikeout rates most of his career, putting up a very respectable 21.5% K% in 43 MLB games. There is almost no way this guy isn't going to start raking his face off in the very near future. The swing is a little on the long side, the 31.7% whiff% doesn't look as good as the K rates, he chases a lot with a 35.4 Chase%, and the launch is low at 6.8 degrees, but he legitimately has the type of profile that can make all of those things work and still put up big numbers. And at only 21 years old, his plate skills and launch are only going to improve. He's right on track to be one of the best hit/power combo bats in the game, and if there is any buy window based on the small, mediocre MLB sample, I would be all over it. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/83/.262/.319/.461/5 Prime Projection: 89/33/103/.279/.343/.516/7

6) Manny Machado - SDP, 3B, 32.9 - Machado underwent elbow surgery in early October 2023 which brought his rehab timeline right up against the start of 2024, and it seems pretty clear that was the reason for his slow start (.611 OPS in his first 42 games). But he quickly shook the rust off, and he looked healthy the rest of the way, slashing .297/.345/.525 with 24 homers, 9 steals, and a 17.7/6.9 K%/BB% in his final 110 games. He smashed the ball all season with a 92.5 MPH EV, so some of those early season struggles might have also just been bad luck. Everything was within career norms with zero signs of decline. He's creeping up there in age, but he's still a very impactful win now piece. His value might be in a very reasonably priced range this off-season for a win now team. - 2025 Projection: 82/30/97/.277/.334/.480/9

7) Matt Shaw - CHC, 3B/2B/SS, 23.4 - The little man discount never fails. Baseball scouts see a little man, and they immediately shave a few inches of projection right off the top. I don't mind it, because it consistently creates excellent buying opportunities for the right players (see the Chicago Cubs Team Report Dynasty Strategy Section below for more thoughts on this), and Matt Shaw is definitely one of those right players. He went a little later than he should have in the real MLB Draft, then he went a little later than he should have in Dynasty First Year Player Drafts, and now he's getting ranked a little later than he should be on prospect lists. He's an elite prospect that gets ranked like a merely good one. He's under 6'0'', but his bat packs a true punch, putting up an 89.3 MPH EV with a 14.6 degree launch in 35 games at Triple-A. He smoked 21 homers on the season in 121 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. He's not a pull machine, but a lot of these lift and pull machines put up some pretty low batting averages, and a profile like Shaw doesn't need to only pull the ball. He can use his hard hit ability, plus speed (31 steals), and plus contact rates (18.2% K%) to do damage when he goes oppo. He also walks a ton with a 11.9% BB%, making him a likely top of the order bat. Don't fall into the little man trap, Shaw is going to be a do everything fantasy terror when he gets his shot, and with the Isaac Paredes/Cam Smith trade, that shot could come very early into 2025. Shaw's been a target for me from before his junior year of college, and he remains a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 41/9/45/.256/.318/.419/12 Prime Projection: 96/23/83/.276/.348/.461/26

8) Jordan Westburg - BAL, 2B/3B, 26.1 - I've been saying that Mark Vientos was my best target call of 2024, but Westburg isn't far behind. I closed out his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "That is a pretty Teflon combination of skills to have. While Gunnar and Adley hog all the attention on the MLB level, and Holliday, Mayo, Basallo etc … hog all the attention on prospect lists, you should sneakily tip toe in there and steal Westburg from his current owner like a thief in the night." ... that teflon combination of skills I was talking about showed back up in 2024, and this time it unsurprisingly resulted in an excellent season with 18 homers, 6 steals, a 21.7% K% and 125 wRC+ in 107 games (he missed almost two months with a fractured hand but returned before the end of the season). He smokes the ball with a 11.8% Barrel%, 91.1/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch and 46.1% Hard Hit%. He has plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint, he gets the bat on the ball with a 21.7% K%, and he's an above average defender at 3B. The 4.9% BB% was low, but he doesn't have any major chase issues, so I'm not too concerned about that. Like Cowser, I don't love that he was only 6 for 9 on the bases. As much as I like the bat, that base stealing element is big to put the profile over the top, and it seems we can't really count on that. It prevents him from truly blowing up, but it doesn't prevent him from being a Top 100 dynasty asset. - 2025 Projection: 79/26/87/.269/.325/.473/9

9) Royce Lewis - MIN, 3B, 25.10 - The constant lower body injuries seems to have finally worn on Lewis, especially in the 2nd half, where he slashed .191/.236/.257 with 1 homer, 0 steals, and a 24.2/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 42 games. His speed also fell off a cliff with a well below average 26.6 ft/sec sprint which is in the bottom 28% of the league. Considering he injured his quad pretty seriously in the first game of the season when he tried to turn the jets on rounding 2nd base (he missed 2 months), it's understandable that he might not have wanted to really go full speed when he returned. He missed another month of the season in July with a groin injury. So it's also understandable that he didn't attempt a single steal all season. While it's understandable, it doesn't make it good for fantasy, and if we can't count on him being a true contributor in steals, which we can't, it definitely takes a nice chunk out of his fantasy value. It's not only steals though, his power production took a big step back too with his EV falling 3.1 MPH to 87.1 MPH. The plate skills are average at best with a 22.8/8.6 K%/BB%. And of course, he keeps getting hurt, playing in only 82 games. It looked like Royce was ascending as one of the young stars in the game in the first half of the season, but when it was all said and done, it was a really mediocre year. He still hit 16 homers with a 11.2% Barrel%, and if he gets healthy this off-season, I'm sure his speed and EV can bounce back, so I would still value him as a Top 100 dynasty asset, but considering the injuries, lack of steals, declining hard hit, and terrible finish to the season, I just don't see how you can really value him in that young star tier right now. - 2025 Projection: 70/25/84/.262/.328/.475/5

10) Mark Vientos - NYM, 3B, 25.3 - I was all over Vientos last off-season as a major target like it was my job (wait ... it was my job), writing, " Vientos is one of the premier up and coming power hitters in the game, and he gets valued like he's barely worth discussing." His truly elite power was staring me right in the face, and when he finally got the opportunity in 2024, he unsurprisingly went gangbusters. He jacked out 27 homers in 111 regular season games, and then he ripped 5 dingers in 13 post-season games. The 91.2/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV and 14.1% Barrel% fully back up the power. He was also better than expected at the hot corner, playing a serviceable 3B. The contact rates and plate approach weren't good, but they did actually take a step forward from 2023 with a 29.7/7.3 K%/BB%. That isn't good enough to say he is now one of the elite power hitters in the game, really putting him in that 2nd tier of power hitter. He also didn't steal a single bag, and while you don't roster him for steals, the difference between a guy who nabs like 7 bags vs. zero starts to add up in your lineup. The time to acquire Vientos was last off-season, so I can no longer call him a true target, but his 2024 season was certainly real, and if he can continue to improve the plate skills, he has the potential to join the elite tier of power hitters. - 2025 Projection: 78/34/93/.252/.321/.520/1

11) Jake Burger - TEX, 1B/3B, 29.0 - Burger simply crushes baseballs with a near elite 74.7 MPH swing that produces big time exit velocities (91.3/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV). He doesn't do anything else particularly well, but as long as he makes enough contact (his 25.9% K% was a career best and it's been improving every year of his career), and gets on the field (I don't think Texas traded for him to sit him on the bench), he will be a major asset in our game of fantasy. He has a career BA of .251 in 1,344 PA, and as I laid out, his power is no joke. Burger deserves to be treated as a pretty coveted fantasy asset. Don't underrate him. 2025 Projection: 73/32/89/.251/.308/.480/1

12) Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - If you think Holliday had a bad MLB debut, get a load of this guy. Mayo was utterly lost at the dish with a .294 OPS and 47.8/8.7 K%/BB% in 46 PA. He had zero barrels with an 84.7 MPH EV and a 45.6% whiff%. It's a small sample, but I've seen a lot of poor debuts, and this one is up there with some of the worst, especially for a hyped up prospect. The debut was especially bad, but we've seen plenty of eventual studs have a terrible MLB debut. Just to use one example, Aaron Judge had a .179 BA with a 42.5% whiff% in his 95 PA debut (although it came with 4 homers and a .608 OPS), and he's been just fine. I don't want to put too much weight on the scary debut when Mayo has so many other things going him. His power is unquestionable at 6'5'', 230 pounds with 22 homers and a 90.7 MPH EV in 89 games at Triple-A. He swings a lightning quick bat with a double plus 74.1 MPH swing, and it's a relatively short swing too with a 7 foot length. His strikeout rates were also so much better in the minors with a 24.9% K% this year. He was getting sporadic playing time in the majors and doing a lot of pinch hitting, which is another reason to mostly ignore the MLB numbers. Is it in the back of my mind? Yea, I'm human. But I'm still treating him like an elite power hitting prospect. He currently doesn't have a starting job, so he's going to need injuries/ineffectiveness to open one up for him, or he's going to have to truly kick the door down. - 2025 Projection: 39/14/49/.225/.302/.435/3 Prime Projection: 84/33/98/.249/.336/.512/6

13) Isaac Paredes - HOU, 3B, 26.1 - Here is what I wrote about Paredes in my End of Season Dynasty Rankings: "Trade to Chicago had bad news written all over it as he got a major ballpark downgrade for his hitting profile, and that has played out with a 86 wRC+ in 47 games since the trade. Chicago has Cam Smith and Matt Shaw in the wings, so I think it's very possible they flip him again this off-season." ... All is right with the world now that Chicago did the right thing and traded Paredes to a ballpark that fit his hitting style. And his hitting style is to often lift and pull lightly hit flyballs that barely clear a cheap left field wall. They say sports can mirror real life, so let's use Paredes as a good lesson to find an environment that best fits your skills, rather than trying to jam your skills somewhere that doesn't fit. He should get back to the hitter he was in Tampa with an about .250 BA, mid 20's homers, and almost zero speed. Add a star in OBP leagues as he consistently walks a ton. - 2025 Projection: 77/25/83/.247/.350/.448/1

14) Alex Bregman - FRA, 3B, 31.0 - We all know that Bregman is going to be pretty ballpark dependent with his lift, pull, mediocre FB EV profile, so evaluating him before we know where he lands isn't optimal. He did his usual .260 BA with mid 20's homers and under 5 steals thing in 2024, but in the wrong ballpark, those numbers could start to look even more uninspiring. He's not Isaac Paredes level dependent on ballpark though. He still had an 89.1 MPH EV, which is really good, and he's been bringing his pull rates down over the last few years, sitting below 40% this year. He can be a really good hitter regardless of the ballpark, but he might lose like 5 homers in a tougher park. The only thing different about his profile in 2024 was that his walk rate tanked with a 6.9% BB% (12.7% BB% in 2023), but it's such a one year outlier, you have to think that bounces back in 2025. It's a bit of a downgrade for his OBP value though. - 2025 Projection: 88/24/86/.264/.340/.445/4

15) Matt Chapman - SFG, 3B, 31.11 - Chapman hit 9 homers at home and 18 homers on the road. Sorry to start his blurb off as a bummer, but his home ballpark is going to blunt any offensive upside he has. And he has considerable offensive upside with a 93.2 MPH EV and 16.2 degree launch. His 76.6 MPH swing was 6th best in baseball, so we are talking about a truly special power bat here. He's hit a lot of homers in his career, but I'm scratching my head as to how he hasn't hit even more. To his credit, Chapman took matters into his own hands and improved the areas of his game that were more ballpark proof, which was his baserunning (15 steals which was a career high by far), and contact (23.5% whiff% which was also a career high by far). He's always been fast with a 28.7 ft/sec sprint, so I don't see why he wouldn't keep on running at least somewhat. I've always been a bit higher than consensus on Chapman because of the huge EV's, but I'm always lower than consensus on SF hitters because of that terrible ballpark. So those two things cancel each other at and now puts me exactly at consensus for Chapman. - 2025 Projection: 89/28/81/.243/.330/.461/10

16) Alec Bohm - PHI, 3B, 28.8 - There is a reason why I am locked in on power/speed upside when targeting minor league players, rather than the better in real life, low launch line drive hitters, because even when they completely pan out, like Alec Bohm, it just makes for such a boring fantasy player. He put up a career best (other than his smaller sample rookie year) 115 wRC+ with a .280 BA, and it still resulted in him finishing 84th on the Razzball Player Rater. He hit 15 homers with 5 steals and 159 combined RBI/Runs. It just isn't hard production to replace, maybe except the BA, but if I'm going to make a BA play, they better steal a bunch of bases too. Even when a player like this works out, they still make for a kinda awkward fit on my roster with how I like to build my teams. They just aren't my type of players. - 2025 Projection: 75/18/92/.278/.330/.445/5

17) Josh Jung - TEX, 3B, 27.2 - Jung suffered a broken wrist after getting hit by a pitch just 4 games into the season, and wrist injuries are known to linger and absolutely kill hitters. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened with Jung. He underwent surgery to repair the wrist, and when he returned in late July, he just wasn't the same hitter. He put up a 86.2 MPH EV after notching a 91.8 MPH EV in 2023. It's clear he wasn't healthy, and the Rangers ended up shutting him down in late September. He then got another surgery on the tendon in that wrist in October. I'm pretty scared off by wrist injuries for hitters. It ended Alex Kirilloff's career before it could even get off the ground, among others. Like with his teammate Evan Carter, I don't want to just live in complete fear of an injury, and nobody really knows if it will eventually completely heal, or if this is now going to be a constant problem. And like Carter, I just don't think it makes sense to sell low in cases like this. We've seen what a healthy Jung could do in 2023 (23 homers in 122 games), and while it's anyone's guess if he will be completely healthy in 2025, I would hold on to find out. He's a hold. I would definitely take a star away in OBP leagues though, as he now has 805 MLB PA with a .301 OBP. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/78/.253/.307/.445/6

18) Maikel Garcia - KCR, 3B/2B, 25.1 - Garcia was a major target for me last off-season, and while he didn't have the game power breakout I thought was possible, and despite being very unlucky, he still finished 115th overall on the Razzball Player Rater, which is better than I expected considering the disappointing season. His 37 steals were the 7th most in baseball, and he only got caught 2 times. He hit only .231, but with a 16.5% K% and 90.4 MPH EV, that is so clearly the result of bad luck (.260 xBA). He didn't make any attempts to unlock more game power with a low launch and low pull rate, so that just might not be an adjustment he's interested in making. He's entering his mid 20's, and I do still think a game power uptick is possible, but it's hard to count on it. He's an above average defensive player at 3B and he doesn't have much competition for the job, so all indications are that KC is going to run it back with Garcia in 2025, but it's likely to come at the bottom of the order this year, especially after the India trade. I can't say he's a major target for me this off-season, and while I lean calling him a miss, maybe a neutral is more accurate. He's settling in as a contact/speed play, but the high EV gives him just enough of an upside boost to stay interesting. - 2025 Projection: 76/10/64/.266/.320/.382/29

19) Noelvi Marte - CIN, 3B, 23.6 - Marte got popped for an 80 game PED suspension in March, which shocked the prospect and baseball world. My first instinct isn't to just drop talented players down the rankings when they get popped for PED's, but when Marte returned mid-season, he did everything in his power to prove he was actually cheating. Everything got much worse from his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 46 wRC+ in 242 PA, which was the 6th worst mark in baseball (min 240 PA). Only Tim Anderson, Brandon Drury, Javier Baez, Dominic Fletcher and Eddie Rosario were worse. He got slower with his home plate to 1B runtime dropping from 4.3 to 4.43. His EV dropped from 91.3 MPH to 87 MPH. His Chase% jumped from 28.6% to 37.1%. His K% jumped from 20.3% to 31%. He was also terrible on defense, leading to a negative 1.5 WAR on the season. He was quite simply one of the very worst players in baseball. It's possible that the horrific season wasn't purely because he wasn't on the juice anymore. It's certainly possible that the suspension threw off his entire season both mentally and physically. An entire off-season to regroup should be a big help towards bouncing back in 2025. I'm not giving up on him at all, but I do think there has to be a major penalty for the possibility he was in fact cheating. I know everyone, including me, kinda brushes off the PED thing nowadays, but guys can still genuinely cheat, right? Marte drops from a Top 100 dynasty asset to more of a Top 200 one, and even that might be generous. - 2025 Projection: 66/14/61/.240/.300/.403/19 Prime Projection: 82/21/76/.260/.326/.441/26

20) Cam Smith - HOU, 3B, 22.1 - Selected 14th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'3'', 224 pound Smith generates a tremendous amount of power with very little movement in his swing. It is quick, powerful and short to the ball. It is straight up one of the quietest swings from one of the biggest men I've ever seen. The swing is geared more for a line drive, all fields approach rather than pull and lift, which is why he didn't put up the gaudy homer totals as some of his other college hitting brethren with only 16 homers in 66 games in the ACC. But he has the raw power to make that profile work, and the upside is that it can come with a high BA. We saw what this profile can look like at it's best in his dominant pro debut, slashing .313/.396/.609 with 7 homers, 2 steals, and a 17.9/11.2 K%/BB% in 32 games split between Single-A, High-A, and Double-A. He put up a 122 wRC+ in 5 games at Double-A, so the profile was transferring to the upper minors, and he clearly had no problems ripping dingers to all fields with the wood bat. He very well might have the top hit/power combo in the FYPD class, and it's why Houston targeted him in the Kyle Tucker trade. The trade doesn't really change his value at all, but he will definitely get a nice ballpark upgrade even if he doesn't have the type of profile that necessarily needs it. - 2025 Projection: 12/4/17/.247/.308/.412/1 Prime Projection: 84/24/89/.273/.340/.466/4

21) Charlie Condon - COL, 3B/1B/OF, 21.11 - Let me just start by saying that I've been valuing pro debuts extremely high from the second I started writing back in 2015/16, and it has served me extremely well in both directions (moving guys both up and down). It was back before any other outlet would even consider changing their evaluation or ranking of a player based on their pro debut. When asked, they would just hand wave it away and say something like "small sample," even though the sample was often actually bigger in pro ball than it was in their Junior year of college (back when the draft was in early June). It made no sense to me why the pro debut with wood bats and more advanced pitching wouldn't be weighed more heavily. And now, you see basically every outlet change their ranking at least somewhat based on the pro debuts, which is the right move. That brings us to Charlie Condon, who just had the type of pro debut you have nightmares over. Despite all of his pre draft hype, he did have some hit tool questions at 6'6'' with relatively high K rates throughout his college career. And the hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball with a .180 BA and 31.2/3.7 K%/BB% in 25 games. That isn't just bad, that is atrocious. Completely lost. It's not great that the only question he had coming out of the draft was immediately answered, and not in a good way. This was a 21 year old in the lower minors (High-A). You need a high FYPD college bat to dominate in the majors by like 23 years old, let alone High-A. Jacob Berry and Chase Davis were the last two hyped college bats to have poor pro debuts, and neither of their values are anywhere close to where you wanted them to be. Condon is a better prospect than both of those guys, and I'm not dropping him as far down as those guys at all, but I do believe he does deserve a real drop. This draft class was already really tightly packed at the top with a lot of really, really good college talent, but no one true standout. So based on Condon's poor debut, I don't see how it doesn't make complete sense to drop him under those guys. He has a clear carrying tool in his power, and of course I do factor in that the pro debut was at the end of a long season, draft process, new team, new coach, new everything etc ..., so he's still a Top 10 FYPD pick for me. I still like him as a power bat who will get to hit in Coors (but also gets their developmental team, and it looks like he still needs development). I just wouldn't be able to pull the trigger on him until the other similarly talented college players with better debuts (or who didn't debut yet) were off the board first. I feel like that's reasonable. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/31/89/.241/.322/.478/8

22) Max Muncy - LAD, 3B, 34.7 - You can nitpick some signs of decline, like his 7 year worst 10.8% Barrel% (career 13.3% Barrel%), and at 34 years old, I get why you wouldn't want to let any signs of decline slip by you, but overall, he really hasn't shown much decline. He put up a 135 wRC+ in 73 games which is the third best mark of his career. He missed a large chunk of time with an oblique injury, but he put up a 158 wRC+ in 33 games when he returned, so that doesn't look like a long term issue. We know exactly who he is as a low BA, high OBP slugger, and while it's hard to predict the decline, it sure seems like he has at least another big year in the tank here. - 2025 Projection:  83/31/89/.228/.345/.482/1

23) Eugenio Suarez - ARI, 3B, 33.8 - Suarez got off to a cold 1st half in 2024, but the underlying numbers were adamant that he was fine and he closed the season slashing .311/.348/.625 with 24 homers and a 25.6/5.6 K%/BB% in his final 73 games. He also improved his hit tool a bit with his BA bouncing back to .256 on the season (.232 in 2023) with a corresponding bump in K% and whiff% to back it up, but it came at the expense of his plate approach with less walks and more chase. You certainly take that tradeoff in 5x5, and it didn't hurt his OBP too much. He's a good defensive 3B and he hits both righties and lefties well, so he's a locked in true everyday guy with 158 games in 2024 and 162 games in 2023. He's not the type of upper echelon player where I wouldn't be worried at all about decline in his age 33/34 year old season, but there are no signs of it yet. He's a good win now power bat. - 2025 Projection: 76/29/92/.242/.320/.451/2

24) Christopher Morel - TBR, 3B/2B, 25.9 - I'm happy I didn't know about Morel's very elite 76.1 MPH swing before this year, because I might have ended up even higher on him than I already was, and it's a reminder to not overrate bat speed, even though I do think it is a majorly valuable stat to have. Despite the elite bat speed, Morel bottomed out in 2024 with a 82 wRC+ and .196 BA in 152 games. The interesting thing is that his plate approach actually took the step forward we wanted to see with a 26.0/10.0 K%/BB% (31.0/8.4 K%/BB% in 2023), and in theory, it should have resulted in a big year. Clearly the .233 BABIP (career .277 BABIP) played a big role, but he also hit a relatively lackluster 21 homers. He got unlucky, but he also wasn't that good even with neutral luck with a .316 xwOBA (.280 wOBA). And finally he got considerably slower with a 27.3 ft/sec sprint (28.6 in 2023), which could be an indicator he was playing through an injury (he hurt his foot earlier in the year). It's still very easy to make a case to buy Morel, which is the case I made a few years ago, and those skills are still present. Namely, he hits the ball very hard. A full off-season with Tampa going into his age 25/26 year old season could easily result in a big season. Most people seem to have lost hope, and while I wouldn't call him a target, I think I want to go one more year to see what he can do. He's a let him come to you buy for a cheap price only. - 2025 Projection: 68/25/77/.235/.316/.438/10

25) Connor Norby - MIA, 3B, 24.10 - Norby's MLB debut pretty emphatically answered the question of if his profile would transfer to the majors, and that answer is yes. He ripped 9 dingers with a 14.8% Barrel% in 45 games. He does it with a lift and pull profile that put up a 33.9% GB% and 48.7% Pull%. He doesn't have big raw power, but you don't need big raw power with that profile, and the 93.6 MPH FB/LD EV looks much better than the 86.2 MPH AVG EV. The cherry on top is that he is much faster than expected with a 29.3 ft/sec sprint, and while he's not a huge base stealer (3 for 6 in his debut), he did steal 13 bags in 80 games at Triple-A, so he could easily be a 10+ guy. The downside of his profile transferring is that the rough plate approach transferred too with a 33.0/7.7 K%/BB% and 34.8% Chase%, leading to a .236 BA and .294 OBP. It's also worth mentioning that Miami is among the worst ballparks for righty homers, and since Norby doesn't have huge raw power, that could become a problem down the line, although it wasn't a problem in 2024 with 7 homers and a 1.102 OPS in Miami. He's also a bad defensive player, which puts a lot of pressure on the bat. I'm a sucker for a lift and speed profile, but he doesn't run quite enough, and there are enough other warts in his game to make me hesitant to really go all in on Norby, but there is a very exciting fantasy profile lurking in here if he can improve his plate skills and possibly get stronger too. - 2025 Projection: 77/21/71/.246/.313/.440/10

26) Luis Rengifo - LAA, 2B/3B, 28.1 - Rengifo's season ended on August 2nd after undergoing wrist surgery. He was in the midst of a fantasy breakout on the back of a career high by far 24 steals in just 78 games, but with a well below average 26.9 ft/sec sprint, and a previous career high of 6 steals, I don't know how many you can truly count on for 2025. The .300 BA was lucky with a .262 xBA, although the 14.5% K% was a career best, so it wasn't a complete fluke. And the rest of his profile is still lacking with a 2.5% Barrel% and .295 xwOBA. He's not good on defense either, playing a below average 2B, 3B, and SS. I'm just not buying into this, and with Christian Moore on the way (and Gleyber Torres rumors), I'm not even certain he's going to be a full time starter. He's just not one of my guys. (after writing this blurb, I looked at the objective projection I gave him, and it's not bad at all, but I'm still weary of it). - 2025 Projection: 73/15/68/.270/.324/.427/20

27) Orelvis Martinez - TOR, 2B/3B, 23.5 - Martinez got popped with an 80 game PED suspension in June, and I'm honestly struggling to figure out how much to dock him for that. I didn't dock Tatis much for his PED suspension, and that turned out to be a good move. But Tatis was an established MLB superstar already. I then followed suit by not docking Noelvi Marte much, and that looks like a mistake with him possibly being the worst player in MLB last year, dropping off everywhere you look. Martinez clearly fits better into the Noelvi mold than Tatis mold, but everyone is their own person, and I don't want Marte's season to influence Martinez' ranking too much for me. Martinez returned in September and he put up a .882 OPS with 1 homer in 11 games at Triple-A, so that is a good sign that the suspension won't impact him that much. And before the suspension, he was beasting the league with 17 homers, a 13.1% Barrel%, 46.1% Hard Hit%, 23.8/8.5 K%/BB%, and a 120 wRC+ in 74 games. His power is no joke with 30+ potential on the MLB level. Toronto traded for Gimenez, but 3B is still open for the taking, and it wouldn't be crazy to see Martinez win that role pretty quickly into 2025 (pending any off-season moves). I'm going to stay a bit restrained here because of the suspension, but I don't want to be overly scared off. This is a big time power bat who is knocking on the door of the bigs with opportunity. I'm cautiously buying. - 2025 Projection: 36/12/43/.229/.298/.422/1 Prime Projection:  76/28/87/.247/.323/.477/3

28) Deyvison De Los Santos - MIA, 1B/3B, 21.9 - De Los Santos is a one tool player, but that tool is so massive and so important, that it just might overcome that he does nothing else well on a baseball field. And that thing is of course double plus power. He's a power hitting bull at 6'1'' with 40 homers and a 90.6 MPH EV in 137 games in the upper minors. He swings and misses a lot (24.6% K%), he doesn't walk (5.8% BB%), he hits the ball on the ground way too much (50%+ groundball rates), he's bad on defense, and he doesn't steal bases. There is actually one other thing going for him, which is that he's been very young for the upper minors in 2023-24, and he'll still be just 21 years old for almost half of the 2025 season. There is time for him to improved his plate skills and launch. If he can, he has the upside to be one of the best power hitters in baseball, but even if he can't, there is a role for a guy who can hit 30+ homers even if that is all he does well. Miami should also have plenty of opportunity for him if he's raking. - 2025 Projection: 63/23/75/.228/.280/.426/1 Prime Projection: 73/31/88/.256/.314/.495/2

29) Cam Collier - CIN, 3B, 20.4 - Collier might be the most underrated power hitting prospect in the minors. He's a big physical guy at 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful and quick lefty swing that is made to do damage, so he most certainly looks the part. It's what got him drafted 18th overall. And now he has the production part too with a blow up season at High-A as a 19 year old. He smashed 20 homers with a 25.0/13.0 K%/BB% and 129 wRC+ in 119 games. He crushes the ball and the power is at least plus. Age to level production, EV, pedigree, approach, eye test, great eventual home ballpark ... Collier has a ton of things going for him, and he really gets barely any hype. There is definitely hit tool risk, but that often comes with the package for young power hitters. Don't underrate Collier. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/29/93/.252/.333/.486/5

30) Nolan Arenado - STL, 3B, 33.11 - The Cards are trying to trade Arenado, but he pulled a card of his own, the full no trade clause card. He rejected a trade to Houston. It seems he has about 6 teams he wants to go to, with the Dodgers seemingly the one he's pushing for (all just based on rumors). I'm guessing this gets resolved at some point and he ends up moved. He's a shell of his former self, bottoming out in 2024 with a career low 86.3 MPH EV and .296 xwOBA. The contact rates are still excellent with a 14.5% K%, he can still lift and pull, his speed was the same (slow, but the same), and his defense was still excellent, so it might have been just a down year rather than the start of the cliff. Or at least it was a combo of both, so I would expect a power bounce back in 2025 (only 16 homers in 152 games). The Cards were also the 9th worst park for righty homers, and based on his preferred destinations, he will almost certainly get a ballpark bump. I actually don't hate him as a buy low win now option if his name value doesn't inflate his price too much. - 2025 Projection: 75/24/83/.269/.322/.441/3

31) Brady House - WAS, 3B, 21.10 - House hasn't had the elite prospect explosion we hoped for when he was a hyped high school bat, and his .241/.297/.402 triple slash with a 26.4/5.7 K%/BB% in 129 games split between Double-A and Triple-A isn't all that impressive either, but when evaluating prospects, you have to have an eye towards who they can be, rather than who they are today, and House can definitely still be a middle of the order power bat at peak. His power did take a step forward this year with 19 homers, and he's still a relatively svelte 6'4'', so I think there is more power coming when he gets into his man muscles years. Keep in mind he was just 21 years old in the upper minors, while hyped, similarly aged college bats were struggling or not exactly dominating in the lower minors. He needs to improve his hit tool and plate approach, which is why he isn't ranked higher on this list, but he still looks on track to be that middle of the order power bat we thought he could be. The Nationals 3B job is also wide open for the taking in both the short term and the long term. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/36/.230/.291/.408/4 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.253/.326/.457/9

32) Brock Wilken - MIL, 3B, 22.10 - Wilken is a 6'4'', 225 pound masher who has the 3B job wide open for him right now with Willy Adames hitting free agency, likely moving Joey Ortiz to SS (or Turang to SS and Ortiz to 2B). There definitely seems to be a path to playing time, and there is little doubt that he will hit dingers and get on base when he gets that chance with 17 homers and a 13.4% BB% in 108 games at Double-A. The hit tool was worse than we hoped for with a .199 BA and 28.2% K%, but some of that was definitely bad BABIP luck. He was also hit in the face with a pitch on April 11th, sustaining multiple facial fractures, so I think we can cut him some extra slack for that, although he performed better the first 3 months after returning than he did in August and September, so maybe that is just an excuse. Either way, I'm betting on the monster power, pedigree (18th pick in the 2023 MLB Draft) and opportunity. - 2025 Projection: 27/11/36/.219/.296/.427/1 Prime Projection:  75/28/86/.238/.320/.476/2

33) Eric Bitonti - MIL, 3B, 19.5 - In my End of Season Mailbag Podcast (Patreon), I ran down a list of several of my favorite underrated and/or reasonably priced prospect targets to go after, and Bitonti easily cracked that list. He has future elite power hitting prospect written all over him at 6'4'', 218 pounds with a powerful, athletic and sweet lefty swing that is made to hit bombs. He smoked 8 homers with a 157 wRC+ in 51 games at the age appropriate stateside rookie ball, and then he got called up to Single-A and went nuclear with 8 homers in just 28 games. With his raw power and an over 50% FB%, he can't not hit homers. He also gets on base a ton with a 16.5% BB%, which offsets some of the swing and miss issues (27.9% K%). And he's a good athlete with 12 steals in 15 attempts over 79 games, so he should contribute at least a handful in that category. He already cracked my Top 100 Prospects Rankings at #90 overall in my End of Season Top 322 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings (Patreon), and this is just the beginning. Definitely go after him everywhere. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/33/97/.242/.331/.497/8

34) Joey Ortiz - MIL, 3B, 26.8 - It seems like Ortiz will slide over to SS to take over for Willy Adames (Turang could factor in too), but either way, his full time job seems very safe with a plus infield glove. His hard hit ability wasn't able to fully transfer to the bigs with a 87.8/91.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, resulting in only 11 homers in 142 games, but his strong plate approach did transfer with a 20.2/11.0 K%/BB%, leading to an above average 104 wRC+. He's fast with a 28.7 ft/sec sprint, but he's not a good base stealer with 11 steals in 17 attempts. It's a low upside, solid across the board profile if things go well, and if things don't go well, it's below average across the board. I'm betting on things going relatively well though. 2025 Projection: 71/15/67/.256/.327/.406/13

35) Ryan McMahon - COL, 3B, 30.3 - McMahon's hard hit ability (92.1 MPH EV) has roped me in in the past, but those days are long over at this point, and it gave me the strength to not buy into his hot start to the season at all (.920 OPS in his first 32 games). By the end of the year, he was right back to his usual underwhelming self with 20 homers, a .242 BA, and a .722 OPS. He just doesn't lift and pull enough to take advantage of the hard hit (49% GB% with a 35.8% Pull%), and the hit tool isn't good enough either (28.7% K%). He's a good defensive 3B and it's not like the Rockies have any better options, so his job is safe, but he's just a serviceable 3B, not an impact one for fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 76/23/74/.245/.325/.425/5

36) Brayden Taylor - TBR, 3B/SS, 22.10 - Taylor destroyed High-A with 14 homers, 26 steals, a 24.8/15.9 K%/BB% and a 154 wRC+ in 84 games, but he's an advanced college bat, and he doesn't have big raw power or big raw speed, so seeing what he could do in the upper minors was important, and it was a mixed bag at best. The K% exploded to 36.8% (.194 BA), but he still knocked out 6 homers with 3 steals and a 113 wRC+ in 30 games. He's a lift and pull machine, so even without big raw power, he can hit dingers, and he's not a burner, but he's been a really good base stealer at every stop of his career. It's the hit tool that is the real problem, and while I'm sure he will be better his second time around in the upper minors, it's still not a good sign for what his hit tool will look like in the majors. A high K rate with mediocre EV's and lots of flyballs is a recipe for a very low BA. It's still a fantasy friendly skillset with pedigree (19th overall pick) and strong production at every stop of his career, so while I can't call him a truly coveted prospect, I still like him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/20/76/.242/.325/.435/15

37) Ke’Bryan Hayes - PIT, 3B, 28.2 - Hayes was dealing with a back injury all season that ended his year in mid August (and has dealt with injuries his entire MLB career), and it led to a horrific season with a 59 wRC+ in 96 games. The launch dropped all the way back down to 4.8 degrees, snuffing out any residual hope for a true power breakout. The EV and speed were down majorly too. You can give him a pass for this year for the injury, but this is not the first year that he blamed injuries for poor performance. It's becoming part of his profile, which adds risk, and he doesn't have high upside, so I'm not exactly sure what we are buying here anymore if he isn't safe and he doesn't have upside. - 2025 Projection: 71/13/60/.256/.311/.400/13

38) Brooks Lee - MIN, SS/3B/2B, 24.2 - I've always been a bit low on Lee for fantasy, because a good but not great hit tool first profile, with moderate power and little speed is just not something I go after, even with him getting ranked very high on real life lists. I also wasn't buying into the 8 homers he hit in 25 games at Triple-A this year because of the below average exit velocity and low launch, and sure enough, his MLB debut didn't look great. He slashed .221/.265/.320 with 3 homers, 3 steals, and a 14.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 50 games. His 25.6 ft/sec sprint speed is in the bottom 13% of the league. That is brutal, and it might be part of the reason why the guy scored a shockingly low 9 runs. The EV numbers were poor too with a 85.8 MPH EV and 4.1% Barrel%. And he chases a lot with a 35.8% Chase%, so he doesn't really fit in at the top of the order. He gets the bat on the ball and there is some pop in there, so I never thought he would be a bust or anything, I just thought the upside was low as a solid but not standout hitter, and I still believe that today. He's still not a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 64/14/73/.259/.313/.415/6 Prime Projection: 73/18/81/.277/.331/.436/8

39) Jace Jung - DET, 3B, 24.6 - I called Jung a good prospect to use as trade bait, instead of one you hold before he made his MLB debut this year, and his poor debut showed why. He hit 0 homers with 0 steals, an 86.4 MPH EV, a 26 ft/sec sprint speed, and a 30.9% K%. It's not that I don't think he can be a solid MLB hitter, and his 102 wRC+ and 16% BB% shows very clearly that he can be a solid MLB hitter, it's just that there isn't big fantasy upside. He doesn't hit the ball hard, he's slow, and the hit tool is below average. He can lift and pull it, but both his lift and pull plummeted in the majors, and while that should improve, it's not the best sign. He's also a bad defensive player and he put up a .649 OPS vs. lefties in the minors. His best skill is that he walks a lot, so add a star in OBP leagues, but in general, Jung is not one of my guys. - 2025 Projection: 72/15/65/.238/.318/.402/2 Prime Projection: 82/20/76/.254/.343/.440/3

40) Jeimer Candelario - CIN, 3B/1B, 31.4 - Candelario got a monster ballpark upgrade in Cincinnati, and he did in fact hit a career high homers (on a per game basis) with 20 homers in 112 games. He's never been a huge EV guy, so he definitely needed the ballpark boost to continue to be a 20+ guy. The bad news is that the BA and OBP tanked to .225 and .279. A career worst 29.1% whiff% and 34.6% Chase% backs that up. The bottom line is that he is just an average hitter no matter how you slice it. He has a career 100 wRC+ in 858 career games. The India trades seems to lock him into a full time job, and as usual, he has the chance to be a solid but not really an impact fantasy bat. 2025 Projection: 70/22/79/.237/.308/.431/6

41) Willi Castro - MIN, OF/3B/2B, 27.11 - Castro is a super utility player who was an overall positive on defense (+3.9 Fangraphs value), he hits at the top of the order, scoring 89 runs, and he amassed a ton of at bats with 635 PA. The nature of his everyday role feels a bit precarious long term, but short term it does seem likely he will get a ton of at bats again. He wasn't able to maintain his outlier steal season in 2023 (33 steals), coming back down to earth with 14 in 23 attempts, and he doesn't hit for much power (12 homers with a 87.4 MPH EV) or hit for a high BA (.247 BA with a 23.6% K%). He's optimally getting more like 400-500 PA per season, and not 600+, but right now, it does seem like his path to 600+ is still there. I'm not too intrigued by him in dynasty except in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 77/13/58/.250/.330/.397/17

42) Matt Vierling - DET, 3B/OF, 28.6 - Vierling seems to have a near everyday job in Detroit, but he's a low end option, and his hold on that full time job is very precarious long term, and probably short term too. H has a career 100 wRC+ in 429 games which is dead average, and he has a career .318 xwOBA, which is also almost dead average. His 21.3/7.2 K%/BB% is about average, and his 16 homers with 6 steals is about average (maybe being generous there). But you get the point, he's very MLB average, which is very fantasy below average. He hits the ball hard with a 89.8 MPH EV and he's very fast with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint, but he has a long enough track record, even going back to the minors, to not expect a big homer/steal breakout. 2025 Projection: 72/15/61/.262/.321/.402/8

43) Brett Baty - NYM, 3B, 25.4 - Baty's status is up in the air until the free agency air clears, but as of now, there is opportunity for him to win that 3B job. He had that opportunity in 2024 and failed with a 83 wRC+ in 50 games, resulting in him getting sent down to Triple-A, but he laid down some skills that should result in him reaching his solid MLB hitter destiny if he's given the leash. His 73.5 MPH swing is plus and the contact rates weren't bad at all with a 24.6% K% and 26.2% whiff%. He didn't hit the ball hard with a 86.6 MPH EV, which was the problem, but there is zero doubt that he has considerably more in the tank than that at 6'2'', 210 pounds. He hit the ball hard in 2023 in the majors, so he's proven it too. He also destroyed Triple-A with 16 homers and a 21.2/12.3 K%/BB% in 62 games, which doesn't mean that much, but it's something. The high groundball rates and 10.3 degree launch is why I always cautioned against his 5x5 fantasy upside, because the game power probably isn't huge, but I always thought Baty was going to end up one of those damn good "professional" hitters, and I still think he should reach that peak. - 2025 Projection: 65/18/72/.247/.321/.416/2

44) Bryan Ramos - CHW, 3B, 23.1 - Ramos did not have a good MLB debut with a .586 OPS in 32 games, and he didn't play particularly well in the minors either with a 98 wRC+ in 64 games at Triple-A, but like I mentioned in the Montgomery blurb, there is still a collection of skills here that I'm buying. Despite the poor MLB debut, he put up a 20.4% K%, 25.5% Chase%, a 90.1 MPH EV, an 11.8 degree launch, and a 28.7 ft/sec sprint speed. For a bad debut, that is a damn good collection of numbers. He was also getting hot at Triple-A towards the end of his stay there with 7 homers and a .894 OPS in his final 37 games, which shows you to not get too hung up on the down minor league numbers either. Chicago has nothing but opportunity, so they are going to give him every chance to establish himself. He might not be a league winner, but 20+ homers with a decent BA and a handful of steals is more than useful in most fantasy leagues. - 2025 Projection: 41/13/52/.233/.292/.403/4 Prime Projection: 71/23/80/.252/.318/.450/8

45) Jose Tena - WAS, 3B, 24.0 - Tena looks to be locked in as Washington's starting 3B, but I'm still treading carefully here. He was terrible vs. lefties in the majors (.458 OPS in 48 PA), he was pretty bad at 3B, he was a bad real life hitter (83 wRC+ in 44 games) and Brady House is almost unquestionably the long term starter there. House already spent a lot of time at Triple-A in 2024, so "long term" could be more like very quickly into 2025. Tena also has bad plate skills with both contact and chase issues (24.4/4.2 K%/BB% in the majors and a 25.2/7.4 K%/BB% at Triple-A). He does two things well though, and those things are good for fantasy, which is hitting the ball very hard (91.2/96.8 MPH AVG/FB EV) and speed (28.1 ft/sec sprint with 6 steals in 44 games in the majors). The launch was low in both the majors and Triple-A, so he can't fully take advantage of that power, and he's been a bad base stealer his entire career, so it's hard to count on him truly racking up steals. I see the appeal, and he'll be cheap, so I get it, but he's not one of my later dart throws. All good if he's one of yours though. It's not like he's very expensive right now anyway. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/55/.245/.302/.401/16

46) Miguel Vargas - CHW, 3B/OF, 25.4 - Vargas' dynasty owners finally got what they wished for when Vargas got traded to Chicago, opening up playing time, but they say be careful what you wish for, because he was atrocious. He put up a 16 wRC+ in 42 games. He hit .104 with a .170 SLG. That has got to be close to all time bad in 42 games. His underlying numbers are admittedly still interesting enough with a 21.6% whiff%, 21.8% Chase%, 28.6 ft/sec sprint, and 21.3 degree launch, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough (86.2 MPH EV), and he swings a slow bat (69.8 MPH). He's also not going to contribute much in Runs or RBI even if he does put together a decent season. He's fine as a bottom of the roster type, or as a depth piece in a deeper league, but I'm no longer really eyeing him as an interesting flier type. - 2025 Projection: 46/10/39/.219/.299/.368/7

47) Chase Meidroth - CHW, 2B/3B/SS, 23.9 - Meidroth was part of the return for Garrett Crochet, and if Chicago didn't think he has a very good chance of being a starting caliber player, why would they even want him included. It sure feels like he's the favorite for the starting 2B job right out of the gate, which is a big boost to his value. Unfortunately, that big boost still doesn't boost him very high in my book. The power is lacking with only 7 homers, a 5 degree launch, and a 2.2% Barrel% in 122 games at Triple-A, and so is the speed with 13 steals in 19 attempts. An elite plate approach is his game with a 12.7/18.8 K%/BB%, which led to a .293 BA, .437 OBP, and a 132 wRC+. His 88.6 MPH EV also isn't bad, so while it hasn't led to homers, it could be good enough to maintain the high BA/OBP on the MLB level. If he were potentially hitting atop a really good lineup, I could see real fantasy value here, but in the White Sox lineup, the fantasy value is likely to be lacking for the next few seasons. I can see a path to a solid fantasy player, but it's not a journey I'm looking to go on. - 2025 Projection: 63/11/49/.255/.320/.386/7 Prime Projection: 84/15/61/.276/.352/.416/9

48) Jose Miranda - MIN, 3B, 26.9 - 1B is so light this year, and with Miranda seemingly ticketed for a large share of Minnesota's 1B job, I'll make an exception to the 20 GP qualification I'm using and include him in the 1B rankings along with these 3B rankings. He has an average-ish hit/power combo with a 15.4% K%, 88.9 MPH EV, and 15.5 degree launch. It only resulted in 9 homers and a 5.9% Barrel% in 121 games, so that is very lackluster power output for a 1B, especially one who doesn't walk (4.2% BB%). He put up a 115 wRC+, but the .306 xwOBA shows there was good luck in play there. He's not an MLB starter long term, and even short term I'm sure Minnesota is hoping someone can take this job from him. 2025 Projection: 40/11/48/.262/.312/.418/2

49) Luke Adams - MIL, 3B, 20.11 - Everything I liked about Adams when I named him a deep FYPD sleeper in 2022/23, I still like about him now. He's 6'4''. 210 pounds with plus raw power, good athleticism, and a plus approach. And he keeps proving the profile will transfer one level at a time. He conquered High-A in 2024 with a 154 wRC+, 11 homers, 28 steals and a 21.3/18.7 K%/BB% in 101 games. While there is a lot to like, you can pretty easily build a case against him too. He still hasn't fully tapped into that raw power, he's not a true burner and he gets caught stealing a solid amount (10 CS), and the hit tool has been pretty bad with a .227 BA in 2024 and .233 BA in 2023. It's not hard to see this profile start to fall apart a bit when he gets to the upper minors, and then ultimately the majors. That is why seeing him prove it at Double-A in 2025 is going to be a big step, and only then can his hype really explode into Top 100 prospect range. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/20/76/.252/.333/.441/14

50) Sal Stewart - CIN, 2B/3B, 21.4 - If you like a plus plate approach, Stewart is your man. He put up a 16.9/14.8 K%/BB% in 80 games at High-A which led to a 144 wRC+. It's basically the same thing he did in 2023 and 2022. But he's not just a plus plate approach, he also has very real raw power. Just watch him crush this dinger 454 feet out to centerfield. This is a big physical guy in the box who can certainly unleash more game power if he tries. He hit only 8 homers this year and he likes to spray liners all over the field, so he would definitely have to change his hitting approach to do it, which may or may not work. He might just be content to plate approach his way through the minors. I don't love betting on plate approach guys who don't have much speed and aren't particularly good defensive players, but if he does unlock more game power, he could end up having a very potent hit/power combo at peak. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/21/76/.274/.350/.452/9

51) Tai Peete - SEA, SS/OF/3B, 19.7 - Tai Peete is the same age as many of the high schoolers in the 2024 Draft (he's 1 month younger than Bryce Rainer), and his pure talent can rival any of them (maybe not Konnor Griffin's, but everyone else's). He also already has a pretty strong season at Single-A under his belt with a .269/.343/.408 triple-slash in 115 games. That is a pretty good slash for an 18 year old in full season ball. He hit only 7 homers, but all 7 of them came in his final 59 games, which is the improvement you want to see from a young player as the season goes along. And he has no joke raw power at 6'2'', 193 pounds, so there is a lot more of that coming. He's a really good athlete and he displayed elite base stealing ability with 45 steals in 50 attempts. What I'm trying to say, is that Peete is getting mighty underrated right now. I understand why he's getting rated so low, because the hit tool is a legit problem with a 30.7% K%, but he walked 10.4% of the time too, and you have to take into account his young age for the level. There is definitely still a lot of rawness to his game, but he performed pretty well despite that rawness, so imagine what he can do as he starts to refine his game. I aim for upside in fantasy, and Peete is all upside. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/75/.247/.323/.432/26

52) Addison Barger - TOR, 3B/OF, 25.5 - Barger isn't a good defensive player (although he played a good RF last year), which makes it harder for a fringy type like him to get playing time, but out of all of Toronto's fringy players, I want to bet on his bat the most. I've always gushed over his swing, and seeing his near elite 74.3 MPH bat speed just backs up my visual evaluation. That level of bat speed is not to be trifled with, and while he's had some hit tool troubles throughout his career, he's shown improvement there in the upper minors over the last two years. He put up a very respectable 19.3/16.1 K%/BB% in 57 games at Triple-A this year, and he wasn't too bad in the majors either with a 27.6% whiff% and 26.7% K% (albeit with a .239 BABIP fueled .197 BA). As you know from that bat speed, he hits the ball hard with a 90.1 MPH EV at AAA and a 8.7% Barrel% in the majors. The MLB debut was rough with a 70 wRC+ in 69 games, but like I mentioned, some of that was bad luck, and seeing the contact rates not implode is encouraging. He doesn't run a ton, but a 28 ft/sec sprint shows he's a good athlete. He doesn't seem to have a spot right now, but I would hesitate to write him off with that type of bat speed. I'm side eying him. - 2025 Projection: 44/16/53/.238/.314/.428/4

53) Max Muncy - OAK, SS, 22.7 - Muncy cracks the 3B list because there are rumors he could be competing for that open job. Considering he was the 25th overall pick in the 2021 Draft, he's been flying super low under the radar despite strong minor league results throughout his career, especially when you consider age to level. Oakland has been relatively aggressive with him, and he's responded to the challenge every single time, culminating with him putting up a 117 wRC+ in 50 games at Triple-A in his age 21 year old season this year. He doesn't have a standout area in his game, which is likely why the hype has been so quiet, but he's just a good all around player with 8 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.6/8.9 K%/BB%. He has about average power right now which should only tick up in the next few years, he's a very good athlete who should contribute in steals, and he's known as a good defensive SS, so his glove should help him get on the field The strikeout rates have been high throughout his career and there is definitely hit tool risk, so that combined with the fact he doesn't really have standout power or speed makes me hesitant to go higher than this. He still feels underrated to me though. - 2024 Projection: 36/9/43/.226/.289/.392/7 Prime Projection: 72/20/77/.248/.321/.435/12

54) Thomas Saggese - STL, 2B/3B/SS, 23.0 - Saggese was always a guy who produced above his tools, demanding respect in the prospect world despite being a 5th round pick, but pro ball finally caught up with him at Triple-A. He put up 93 wRC+ with a 23.1/5.9 K%/BB% in 125 games. He then got a cup of coffee in the majors where he struggled hard with a 57 wRC+ and 26.9/3.8 K%/BB% in 52 PA. He just doesn't hit the ball hard enough (87.3 MPH at AAA and 85.7 MPH in the majors), or have good enough plate skills (see K/BB above), or run enough (9 steals) to be too enticing of a fantasy prospect. There also isn't much defensive value, so it's not like the glove will force him on the field. I'm not saying he can't be a solid bat at peak, because I think he can be, I'm just not too enthused about rostering him until it maybe happens. - 2025 Projection: 25/5/29/.237/.293/.389/2 Prime Projection: 66/19/74/.259/.318/.420/8

55) Shay Whitcomb - HOU, 3B, 26.6 - If Whitcomb had a starting job, or even some semblance of a path to a full time job, I would really love him, but he really doesn't have a path. And at already 26 years old, it's hard to say you should hold him for the future. It's a shame, because he's a tooled up hitter with a powerful righty swing (25 homers with a 89.5 MPH EV and 16.9 degree launch in 105 games at Triple-A), and he finally made the hit tool improvement he needed to make, which stuck in his small sample MLB debut. He put up a 19.8/11.0 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 17.4/10.9 K%/BB% in 46 PA in the majors. The 17.9% whiff% is even more impressive. His 76 wRC+ wasn't impressive, but he got unlucky with a .342 xwOBA. He's not a burner with a 27.4 ft/sec sprint (in a small sample, so that might not be his true talent level), but he's a good athlete and he loves to run with 26 steals at Triple-A. He's the type where I would keep a close eye and pounce the second you see him getting at bats, but it's hard to hold until that happens. 2025 Projection: 22/7/28/.244/.308/.417/8

56) Kaelen Culpepper - MIN, SS/3B, 22.3 -  Selected 21st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 185 pound Culpepper is a proven college performer with solid across the board skills. He slashed .328/.419/.547 with 11 homers, 17 steals, and a 14.1%/12.0% K%/BB% in 61 games in the Big 12. He reminds me a lot of Minnesota's 2nd round pick in 2023, Luke Keaschall, who has similar size, speed, and feel to hit. Nothing jumps off the screen, but they get the job done in all facets of the game. Minnesota has had a lot of success with Keaschall, and Culpepper looks to be next with his strong pro debut. He cracked 3 homers with 4 steals, and a 13.4/9.8 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's a nice little "let him come to you" target in off-season prospect drafts right now. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/16/72/.268/.330/.420/18

57) Billy Amick - MIN, 3B, 22.5 - Selected 60th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the reason Amick isn't grouped on the FYPD Rankings with the higher end college hitter prospects, and didn't get drafted as highly as that group of hitting prospects either, is because of his 18.2%/9.9% K%/BB% in 65 games in the SEC. That is both too much swing and miss and too much chasing. He can definitely mash with 23 homers and a 1.026 OPS, and he's a proven SEC hitter, so I still like the bat a lot, and he had a strong pro debut to back up the strong college production. He ripped 3 homers with an 88.5 MPH EV and 19.5/15.6 K%/BB% in 18 gamest at Single-A. It came with a .222 BA and 53.2% GB%, so it wasn't all roses, but it was nice to see the strong plate skills. He's a solid but unspectacular power bat. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 72/22/78/.253/.320/.447/5

58) Tommy White - OAK, 3B, 22.1 - Selected 40th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'1'', 228 pound White has that low and wide batting stance which I've always disliked since I started writing, and now it seems like teams and mainstream scouts are also open about not liking. It's all about the upright batting stance into a leg kick these days. He fell to 40th overall despite ripping up the SEC and ACC all 3 years he was in college, hitting 75 homers with a 14.5%/8.2% K%/BB% in 187 games. And his poor pro debut (2 homers with a 67 wRC+ in 25 games at Single-A) did nothing to change the lukewarm attitude I have (and MLB seems to have had) towards him. A poor defensive player with no speed and low walk rates is a recipe for scratching and clawing for playing time. Having said all that, the contact/power combo from a proven major college performer is good enough to take a shot on at this point of the rankings, and while "Oakland" is getting more crowded, you have to think there will be playing time available if he hits. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/22/79/.253/.310/.450/2

59) Jesus Baez - NYM, SS/3B, 20.1 - Baez' season ended on July 3rd after undergoing knee surgery for a torn meniscus, but he has showing off a very impressive hit/power combo before going down with the injury. He cracked 10 homers with a 15.7 degree launch, 16.2% K% and 123 wRC+ in 64 games at Single-A, and then he snuck in 8 games at High-A where he proved everything will transfer with 1 homer, a 15.6% K% and a 119 wRC+. He's not a huge tools guy at 5'10'', but he's powerfully built and he surely has a powerful righty swing with a 89.7 MPH EV. He's not particularly projectable and the plate approach isn't great, so it might be someone who sees his production drop, or maintain, as he gets to higher levels, rather than someone who just keeps on improving. I think a reasonable upside projection for him would be an above average hit/power combo, rather than a truly special one. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 71/24/79/.263/.321/.441/7

60) Jhonny Severino - PIT, SS.3B, 20.5 - You only have to watch Severino demolish a homer to completely get his appeal. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 185 pounds with that absolute vicious and athletic righty swing that jacked out 16 homers in 84 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A (6 homers in 28 games at Single-A). He's also a good athlete who stole 16 bags in 20 attempts. He was a 19 year old at rookie ball for his first 56 games of the season, so I was a little skeptical of the 15.9/11.8 K%/BB% at that level, and that skepticism proved correct as he put up a much worse 30.1/6.5 K%/BB% at the more age appropriate Single-A. There is definitely risk with much more refinement needed, but the upside is easy to dream on. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 75/24/82/.242/.313/.448/12

61) Kale Fountain - SDP, 3B, 19.8 - Selected 151st in the 2024 MLB Draft, Fountain is a mountain of a man at 6'5'', 225 pounds, and he has the type of power befitting of his size with monster homer totals in high school. He's also a sneaky good athlete with above average run times. He was drafted in the 5th round but signed for $1.7 million, so this was a highly sought after prospect. There is definite hit tool risk, and he's on the old side for his class, but there is tons to like for fantasy. He reminds me of the Brandon Winokur of this year's draft, and Winokur just cracked my Top 100. Fountain is a definite target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/25/81/.240/.315/.462/9

62) Jose Caballero - TBR, 2B/SS/3B, 28.7 - Carson Williams is going to take over Tampa's SS job sooner rather than later, which is going to relegate Caballero to his rightful role as a utility player. He's terrible on offense with a 83 wRC+, .267 xwOBA, an 83.7 MPH EV and a 27.5/5.6 K%/BB% in 139 games. He's good on defense, but he's not that good to overcome that offense. He's a great base stealer, racking up 44 steals, which is the sole area where he derives his fantasy value. He's a bench role player for deep leagues. - 2025 Projection: 48/8/39/.233/.299/.352/26

63) Caleb Durbin - MIL, 2B/3B, 25.1 - I see the huge offensive season Durbin just had at Triple-A, slashing .287/.396/.471 with 10 homers, 29 steals, and a 9.9/12.5 K%/BB% in 82 games (he was even better in the AFL with a .976 OPS in 24 games), but I'm struggling to get past the extremely low 83 MPH EV. He's only 5'6'', he's already 25 years old (as of 2025 Opening Day), and while he has a solid infield glove, he's not some slick fielding SS whose glove will get him on the field. It seems like a utility infielder profile to me, and while the trade to Milwaukee helps his value, I'm not sure he's more than a utility infielder on their team either. On the other hand, his contact/speed combo gives him a very clear path to fantasy usefulness if he does work his way into the lineup. He can also lift and pull it, which we know can overcome a low EV, but an 83 MPH EV isn't just low, it's among the worst in baseball low. I know Durbin has his big supporters, and while I'm not one of them, I understand what they see with contact, speed, lift, pull, and proximity. I don't mind him as a proximity play, but he's not really one of my guys. - 2025 Projection: 49/7/33/.250/.313/.360/17 Prime Projection: 76/10/58/.271/.325/.383/26

64) Charles McAdoo - TOR, 3B, 23.1 - McAdoo was a 13th round pick in 2023 who has done nothing but rake in pro ball, slashing .279/.364/.479 with 17 homers, 21 steals, and a 24.7/10.4 K%/BB% in 124 games split between High-A and Double-A. His production was much worse at Double-A than High-A with a .675 OPS in 63 games, which is a bad sign, but that drop off only happened after he was traded to Toronto, so I want to give him some leeway for a major life event (new city, new org, new coaches, etc ...). He's power over hit at a very strong 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful righty swing, and he lifts and pulls a ton. He's not a burner, but he's a good athlete. He's going to have to scratch and claw for playing time, and there is hit tool risk, but there is fantasy upside in here if he gets his shot. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.238/.309/.431/9

65) Austin Charles - KCR, 3B/SS, 21.4 - Charles was a super raw, super talented project at an uber athletic 6'5'' coming into 2024, and he more or less heads into 2025 with that exact same profile. He was 20 years old and repeating Single-A, which is never a great sign, and while he had a much better season this year with a 121 wRC+, the .257/.353/.386 triple slash with a 25.8% K% and 10 homers in 117 games doesn't exactly look great. You only have to watch him swing the bat once with an insanely athletic, quick, and powerful righty swing to overlook the lackluster statistical profile, and he can certainly lift and pull it with a 35.2% GB% and 60.1% Pull%, so he should be able to get to most of his power down the line. He also has plus speed with 36 steals. The real question is the hit tool, and while it seems the odds are against him hitting enough to be a full time regular, the upside would be considerable if he can figure it out. He continues to hover in that Top 200-ish area for me as a high risk, high reward lotto ticket. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/18/74/.233/.308/.423/19

66) Curtis Mead - TBR, 2B/3B, 24.5 - Mead isn't good on defense, he hits lefties much better than righties, he has below average speed, he doesn't walk a ton, and he's not really a big power hitter. That is just a lot of negatives to overcome. The hit tool is good, but it's not great. He's been terrible in the majors with 2 homers, 2 steals, a 78 wRC+ and a 22.8/5.8 K%/BB% in 224 PA. He's only 24, and I do still think he can become a solid MLB hitter, but the upside isn't very high even if he can reach that upside. - 2025 Projection 18/4/22/.248/.304/.391/1 Prime Projection: 58/16/66/.263/.317/.422/6

67) Juan Brito - CLE, 2B/3B, 23.6 - Brito isn't a good defensive player and Cleveland has started to move him all over the field (1B, 2B, 3B, OF), which isn't a good sign because he doesn't really have that no doubt offensive upside either. But his season at Triple-A was too good to leave off this list. He slashed .256/.365/.443 with 21 homers, 13 steals, and a 16.1/13.5 K%/BB% in 144 games. The 87.3 MPH EV isn't great, but it's not terrible, and it came with a 17.5 degree launch and a 47% Pull%. We know that a strong plate approach with a lift and pull profile can most certainly work. If he can get into the lineup, he should be a rock solid MLB hitter, but his glove could cause problems on that front. - 2025 Projection: 22/5/27/.241/.302/.394/2 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.259/.328/.430/8

68) John Gil - ATL, SS/3B, 18.10 - Gil is a pretty toolsy and projectable 6'1'', 175 pounds, and he's now conquered both levels of rookie ball, putting up a 120 wRC+ in 48 games in the DSL in 2023, and then putting up a 124 wRC+ with 3 homers, 26 steals, and a 16.1/13.3 K%/BB% in 51 games at stateside rookie ball in 2024. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 72 wRC+ in 39 games, but he was barely 18 years old, and the 23.3/11.9 K%/BB% with 14 steals wasn't bat at all. There is definitely room to tack on more mass, and he was lifting and pulling in rookie ball, so he should be able to get to most of his eventual raw power. Gil checks a lot of boxes for a rookie ball player with contact, approach, speed, athleticism, good size, and projection. He's a definite legit breakout candidate in 2025. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/16/58/.273/.336/.419/26

69) Luis Pena – MIL, SS/3B/SS, 18.4 - Pena was the top hit/speed combo breakout in the DSL, slashing .393/.457/.583 with 1 homer, 39 steals, and a 8.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 44 games. He's not a big guy at a relatively skinny 5'11'', but he has an explosive righty swing that can hit the ball hard, there is plenty of room to tack on mass, and he doesn't have any major lift and pull problems, so there is definitely potential for him to develop some level of real power down the line. If he can, that makes for a pretty exciting prospect with contact, speed and power. If he can't, there should still be enough impact there for him to be a enticing hit/speed prospect. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 82/15/64/.272/.331/.425/28

70) Josh Smith - TEX, 3B/SS, 27.7 - Smith is a super utility player who optimally doesn't play everyday, but he could be next man up at several positions, so injuries/ineffectiveness could end up forcing him into near everyday at bats like it did in 2024. He's the epitome of a good bench player with a solid glove, a solid plate approach (20.4/7.8 K%/BB%), a solid EV (87.8 MPH EV), and solid speed (27.6 ft/sec sprint). It resulted in a .258 BA with 13 homers and 11 steals. The deeper the league, the more value he would have. 2025 Projection: 57/12/53/.249/.326/.395/9

71) Anthony Rendon - LAA, 3B, 34.10 - All indications are that Rendon is kinda sick of the whole professional baseball player thing, but he still has two years and like $80+ million left on his contact, so he's going to drag his ass out there whether he likes it or not. Or maybe I'm being too harsh on him and it's just that his body is breaking down and that he can no longer do it at a high level, so his attitude has followed his body, rather than the other way around. Either way, the Angels already announced that he's going to have to earn it in 2024, and they aren't going to just hand him a roster spot, let alone a starting job based on his contract. 2020 was the last season he had anything approaching a good year, barely playing and not playing well over the past 4 seasons. 2024 was the worst yet with a .286 xwOBA and 68 wRC+ in 57 games. His xwOBA's were actually pretty good up until this season, and he still gets the bat on the ball with a 14.7% K%, so a bounce back wouldn't be crazy in 2025, but it seems just as likely LA eats the last 2 years of his salary and calls it a day if it's not looking good early in the season. 2025 Projection: 41/9/41/.249/.328/.396/3

72) Dylan Moore - SEA, SS/3B/2B/OF, 32.8 - Moore is a heavily used utility player whose most valuable format would be a deeper OBP, daily moves league. There is value in here if you can start him vs. lefites (.762 OPS vs .639 OPS vs. righties). He stole 32 bags in 441 PA, which is where he derives most of his value, and he can also pop some dingers with a 8.8% Barrel% and 22.6 degree launch, leading to 10 homers. The hit tool is brutal with a career .206 BA (.201 in 2024), but the .316 OBP is where he can be decent in OBP leagues. He currently has a full time job, but let's see what Seattle does the rest of the off-season. Even with a full time job, he's still just a medium to deep league role player. - 2025 Projection: 59/14/48/.210/.315/.396/28

73) Mike Boeve - MIL, 1B/2B/3B, 22.11 - Boeve is a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect with a solid hit tool and lackluster power/speed combo, but with Milwaukee's 3B job open right now, being a good real life hitter could get him into that lineup. I like Brock Wilken to take the job based on pedigree and upside, but just because I like that, doesn't mean it's going to happen. Boeve proved his hit tool will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .306/.374/.447 with 6 homers, 1 steal, and a 17.0/9.3 K%/BB% in 66 games. He has some raw power, but the launch is low and it's a line drive approach, so there isn't big homer upside, and he doesn't run much. He's not a small guy at a thick 6'1'', so it's possible for him to tap into more game power down the line. This isn't a profile I love buying into, but with the current opening at 3B, I can't ignore the possibility that he could hit his way into the role pretty quickly. - 2025 Projection: 23/5/27/.249/.300/.385/1 Prime Projection: 68/15/65/.269/.326/.418/4

74) Lenyn Sosa - CHW, 2B/3B, 25.2 - Sosa is in a scrum with a bunch of Chicago prospects for their middle infield jobs, and unfortunately, I don't think he is going to be one of the players to emerge, but that will proven on the field. He hits the ball pretty hard with a 89.0/93.0 MPH AVG/FB EV, he can lift it with a 12.3 degree launch, and he can get the bat on the ball with a 20.9% K%. That's not a bad collection of skills, and while it only resulted in an 80 wRC+ in 100 games, a lot of that was due to back luck with an average .316 xwOBA. The plate approach is terrible (3.3% BB%), he doesn't run, and he's not particularly good on defense, so I don't think he's a full time player, and guys like Colson Montgomery, Bryan Ramos, Miguel Vargas, Chase Meidroth and even Jacob Gonzalez are all going to pass him on the depth chart quite soon. - 2025 Projection: 35/11/42/.250/.298/.410/3

75) Gino Groover - ARI, 3B, 22.11 - Low upside college bats aren't exactly my favorite targets, but Groover played to the very top of that profile in 2024, and after keeping it up at Double-A to close out the season, he definitely has my attention. He cracked 3 homers with a 16.4/9.1 K%/BB% in 13 games at the level. This coming off a strong showing at High-A with 7 homers, 3 steals, a 13.7/11.4 K%/BB% and 129 wRC+ in 40 games. I'm still not seeing huge fantasy upside as he doesn't hit the ball all that hard, he doesn't run much, and while the glove is solid, it's not so good that it is going to force him on the field. He can be a solid MLB hitter, and Eugenio Suarez' contract is up after this year, so there is a path to fantasy relevance, but it's just not my type of prospect stash. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 69/18/73/.267/.328/.416/7

76) Isiah Kiner Falefa - PIT\, 2B/3B/SS, 30.0 - Falefa seems to be penciled in as Pitt's SS at the moment, which is not optimal for them. He's a very low end option with an above average glove and below average bat. The below average bat part is what he care about the most for fantasy with a .283 xwOBA in 2024, and he's never put up higher than a .294 xwOBA in his career. He will run a bit with mid teens stolen base ability, making him relevant in medium to deeper leagues if he really can hold onto this job by Opening Day, but I have a hard time believing he is going to be a full time starter at SS all season. - 2025 Projection: 62/8/46/.262/.308/.362/14

77) Ernie Clement - TOR, 3B/SS, 29.0 - There are things to like about Clement, and he has a path to plenty of at bats, but he's really best suited for a utility role. He's already 29 years old and the upside just isn't there for fantasy even if he does have a full time job. The things to like are that he has an above average infield glove, he has elite contact rates with a 9.1% K%, he can lift and pull, and he has speed with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in a .263 BA with 12 homers and 12 steals in 452 PA. That is definitely a serviceable across the board profile if given full time at bats. But it's not the type of player, especially considering his age, where you want him to be a full time starter. He put up a .282 xwOBA, .297 wOBA, a 85.5 MPH EV and 2.4% BB%. It's a light hitting bottom of the order bat that optimally gets 400-500 PA a season, which is what he got in 2024. 2025 Projection: 58/14/61/.265/.304/.401/13

78) Eguy Rosario SDP, 3B, 25.7 - On surface stats alone, Rosario had an excellent season at both Triple-A and the majors. He slashed .263/.361/.531 with 21 homers, 19 steals, and a 21.3/12.3 K%/BB% in 95 games at Triple-A, and then he popped 3 homers with a 125 wRC+ in 57 MLB PA. The underlying numbers weren't bad either, but they weren't quite as impressive with a 86.8 MPH EV at Triple-A, and a 41.9% whiff% and 34.7% Chase% in the majors. Granted, he did crush the ball in the majors with a 14.7% Barrel%, and he definitely has some legit raw juice in his bat. He ran a lot in the minors, but he wasn't a particularly good base stealer, and he's not a burner, so while he'll likely contribute in the category, I wouldn't expect big totals. He seems like a bench bat to me optimally, but San Diego is thin, so he's not far away from playing time. 2025 Projection: 29/8/34/.241/.298/.417/4

79) Gage Workman - CHC, SS/3B, 25.5 - The Cubs took Workman 10th overall in the Rule 5 Draft, giving him a leg up on a roster spot, and with 3B currently ticketed for an unproven rookie, Matt Shaw (who I obviously absolutely love, but as we all know, nothing is guaranteed), it's conceivable that Workman ends up fantasy relevant in 2025. There is very real fantasy upside in here too at 6'4'', 202 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He also had a big time year at Double-A, slashing .280/.366/.476 with 18 homers, 30 steals, and a 27.5/11.7 K%/BB% in 126 games. He was 24 years old and the hit tool is a major issue, which is why he was available in the Rule 5, but if he can make enough hit tool gains in his mid to late 20's, which we've seen plenty of toolsy prospects do in the past, he will get interesting in a hurry. He's a lefty who was much better vs. righties than he was vs lefties, but I think that's a good thing in this case, because it means he can end up a very fun strong side of a platoon player. And his 25.2% K% vs. righties was a tad better. I kinda like him in deeper leagues as a proximity play. 2025 Projection: 17/5/19/.218/.289/.381/5 Prime Projection: 44/11/41/.231/.309/.413/15

80) Ezequiel Duran - TEX, 3B/OF, 25.10 - I loved Duran in 2023 and into the off-season, and while I was worried about his playing time, I wasn't worried about his talent. It turns out I should have been worried about both as his quality of contact dropped off a cliff in 2024. His Barrel% went from 8.7% to 3.4%, his EV dropped from 90.1 MPH to 87.1 MPH, and his launch dropped from 14.0 degrees to 8.9 degrees. It resulted in a 74 wRC+, 3 homers, and a 1 steal in 285 PA. He swings a quick bat with an above average 72.6 MPH swing speed and he's very fast with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint, so it's not like I was imagining things loving him so much. And his contact rates improved with an average 22.1% K% and 24.7% whiff%. But both the underlying and surface numbers were terrible in 2024, and he clearly doesn't have a starting job, or probably a next man up job either, so he's no longer target. He remains on the radar though, and that swing speed tells me he should be able to do better in 2025. 2025 Projection: 31/8/28/.255/.300/.400/5

81) Payton Eeles - MIN, 2B/3B, 25.4 - Payton Eeles is the type of player you want to root for. He's 5'5'' and went undrafted after playing 4 years at a Division II school. So he played a 5th year in Division 1, and then he played in Indy Ball. And oh yea, he's literally raked everywhere he's been. Minnesota gave him a shot in 2024, and he continued to do what he's done everywhere, and that is produce all the way through Triple-A. He slashed .299/.419/.500 with 8 homers, 20 steals, and a 14.6/12.7 K%/BB% in 64 games. He's only 5'5'', but he's thick and he's damn explosive. He's almost like an older version of Jett Williams and Slade Caldwell, except without a one hundredth of the respect. He only put up an 85.4 MPH EV at Triple-A, and the groundball rates are around 50%, so there isn't much power upside, but the hit/speed combo looks pretty damn good. It's probably a utility infielder long term, which is still a super fun success story, but I wouldn't be so sure to cap him there. I think he has starting 2B potential. - 2025 Projection: 19/2/11/.249/.303/.355/7 Prime Projection: 74/10/52/.266/.328/.379/28

82) Darell Hernaiz - OAK, 3B/SS, 23.8 - There are rumors Max Muncy could be considered for the 3B job, which tells me that Oakland optimally sees Hernaiz as a utility infielder long term with Muncy, Wilson, and Gelof as the starters, but just because that's the plan, doesn't mean it's going to work out that way. And Hernaiz is good enough to keep the pressure on all 3 of those guys, slashing .333/.376/.493 with 5 homers, 6 steals, and a 14.0/7.6 K%/BB% in 35 games at Triple-A. He struggled hard in the majors with a 50 wRC+, but a 20.0/8.1 K%/BB% with a 87.1 MPH EV isn't that bad. The launch is low and the 27.5 ft/sec sprint is slightly above average, so we aren't talking about a big talent here, but the guy can hit. If he does find himself with full time at bats, he could put up average across the board numbers. 2025 Projection: 21/3/18/.248/.291/.353/6 Prime Projection: 68/12/51/.266/.324/.388/11

83) Nacho Alvarez - ATL, SS/3B/2B, 22.0 - Nobody is a bigger Nacho fan than me. I named him a super deep sleeper in his FYPD class for deep leagues, and seeing him blossom has been fun to watch, but unfortunately, he's still really only a deep league option. The power/speed combo is just far too lackluster with an 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A and below average speed. He's also not a lift and pull guy, so he can't fall back on that either. The hit tool and plate approach are great with a 15.6/12.8 K%/BB% at Triple-A, but that immediately didn't transfer to the majors with a 31.3/0.0 K%/BB% in 32 PA. He was 21 and it's a super small sample, so I'm not giving it too much credence, but considering the below average power/speed combo, that hit tool/approach needs to be bulletproof. It sure looks like a utility player to me, or a low end regular. 2025 Projection: 11/2/13/.248/.297/.353/2 Prime Projection: 76/13/62/.276/.338/.411/10

84) Yohandy Morales - WAS, 1B/3B, 23.6 - The Nationals are really weak organizationally at corner infield, and they selected Morales pretty high at 40th overall, so he's in the right situation to get as much opportunity as he can handle. And he's done nothing but produce in pro ball, putting up a 119 wRC+ in 69 games at Double-A this year. It only came with 5 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.5% K%, so it was more underwhelming than the wRC+ would lead you to believe, but still. He's a big guy at 6'3'', 225 pounds with big raw power. He's not as finished of a product as you would hope for a college bat, needing to improve his game power and hit tool, but there is power potential in here, and there is a long term path to playing time. 2025 Projection: 16/3/18/.221/.289/.377/1 Prime Projection: 68/17/74/.244/.312/.414/5

85) Cayden Wallace – WAS, 3B, 23.7 - If Tena stumbles, and House isn't ready, Wallace could slide right into that 3B job so easily in 2025. He's a good defensive 3B and he can get the bat on the ball, so if the higher upside, flashier options fail, the safe and stable Wallace could look mighty enticing. He put up a 17.8/7.3 K%/BB% in 56 games at mostly Double-A, and while he didn't perform that well with a 96 wRC+, 3 homers and 4 steals (in 8 attempts), he was playing much better before an oblique injury, followed by a trade to the Nationals, and then followed by a broken rib interrupted his season. It's a mostly low launch, all fields approach, and while he can nab a few bags, he doesn't have big speed, so even if he can find full time at bats, it's a low upside fantasy profile. 2025 Projection: 16/2/19/.236/.288/.372/2 Prime Projection: 51/13/56/.255/.317/.414/7

86) Mac Horvath - TBR, 2B/3B/OF, 23.8 - Horvath is a lift and pull machine, so it's unsurprising that Tampa was intrigued by him in a mid-season trade, and it's an upgrade to get out of Baltimore's logjam. The hit tool is the real problem though with .229 BA and 25.9% K% in 102 games at High-A, and it got way worse after the trade to Tampa with a 34.6% K% in 31 games. He's an excellent athlete with power and speed, but his K rates have been very high in the lower minors, which is not a great sign for an advanced college bat. If anyone can make it work, it's Tampa, but often a guy like this ends up in a part time role for them in their mid to late 20's, which is only so helpful for fantasy. Still a decent upside shot though if the hit tool can improve. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/16/56/.233/.309/.422/18

87) Jack Brannigan - PIT, 3B/SS, 24.1 - Brannigan was a 23 year old at Single-A who had a .238 BA with a 26.1% K%. Odds are the hit tool isn't going to be good enough to be an MLB starter, but if he can make real improvements to the hit tool, the upside is high enough for him to make an impact. Think something like a Luke Raley type career arc, where he breaks out when he's in his late 20's, but you're still not quite sure if he truly has a lock on a full time job. And like Raley, Brannigan has that type of power/speed combo with 18 homers and 12 steals in 77 games. He can lift and pull, he can hit the ball hard, he's a good athlete, and he has a decent infield glove too. He fits nicely into that reasonably priced, high upside bucket of prospect where you don't have to wait 5 years to see what you have. You will know pretty quickly into 2025 once he hits the upper minors. I'm kinda liking him the more I'm thinking about him during this blurb, but the odds are still that he won't hit enough, a la Joey Wiemer. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.228/.311/.431/9

88) Ricardo Cabrera - CIN, 3B/2B/SS, 20.5 - I want to like Cabrera more, but a 83.9 MPH EV in 105 games at Single-A is super underwhelming. He was only 19, so I'm not saying he can't improve there, he almost certainly will, it's just a very low starting point, and it's hard to bet on him truly hitting the ball very hard in the future. It's also not like he was that great statistically, slashing .252/.333/..399 with 11 homers, 19 steals, and a 22.1/6.8 K%/BB%. He also had a 50.2% GB%. He was a high priced international signing who has hit well in pro ball, which is why I feel the pull to like him more, but objectively, he's just not that unique or special of a prospect. He's fine. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/15/71/.264/.322/.411/13

89) Jansel Luis - ARI, 3B/2B/SS, 20.1 - Luis was a breakout candidate coming into 2024, and while he didn't breakout, he did enough to stay on the future breakout radar. He slashed .265/.337/.414 with 7 homers, 20 steals, and a 20.8/7.6 K%/BB% in 109 games at Single-A. He's a pretty explosive player at 6'0'', 170 pounds with plenty of room to add more raw power down the line, but he's still raw in most aspects of his game. He needs to refine the hit tool, plate approach, base stealing, unlocking more game power and defense. It's a lot, but simply hitting the ball harder would cure a lot of ills and he should naturally hit the ball harder as he ages. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/62/.265/.321/.403/18

90) Kyle Karros - COL, 3B, 22.8 - Karros cuts an impressive figure at an athletic looking, Kris Bryant-like 6'5'', 220 pounds, and he had an excellent season at High-A, slashing .311/.390/.485 with 15 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.8/10.0 K%/BB% in 123 games. He was a 5th round pick in 2023, but he was young for his college class, and there could be some late bloomer traits with it taking a bit longer to get his swing down pat with long levers. He's gone through multiple batting stances and it still doesn't exactly look comfortable to me. He's never hit a ton of homers even in college with more of a line drive, all fields approach, but clearly there is more in the tank in a perfect world. It's not a perfect world though, and I'm not sure Colorado is going to be the team to get the most out of him. Interesting prospect, but he's going to have to prove it in the upper minors before I get too excited. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 59/16/69/.244/.311/.408/5

91) Chase Harlan - LAD, 3B, 18.9 - Most of the high school hitting class, except for Morlando and Fountain, are speed over power prospects at the moment, so if you are looking for an upside power bat later in the draft, Harlan is your guy. Selected 98th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Harlan is a 6'3'', 205 pound bruiser putting up some of the best exit velocities in the class. He's also young for the class and will still be 18 years old for half of the 2025 season. If you squint hard enough, you see an Austin Riley clone down the line. And equally as exciting as his profile is that he landed with the Dodgers. If anyone can figure out the best batting stance for him, and get his hit tool to a good enough level for the power to shine, it's the Dodgers. I really like him and he's definitely underrated. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/26/82/.243/.326/.465/5

92) Carson DeMartini - PHI, 3B/SS, 22.3 - Selected 130th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, DeMartini was a pro debut breakout, and you know how much I love my pro debut breakouts. He slashed .315/.385/.478 with 2 homers, 8 steals, and a 13.5/8.7 K%/BB% in 24 games at Single-A. And it's not like he wasn't an absolute beast in his amateur career too. He put up a 1.110 OPS his freshman year in the ACC, a 1.048 OPS his sophomore year, and a 1.072 OPS with 21 homers in 54 games his junior year. He's not a huge guy at 6'0'', 197 pounds, but he can hit it hard enough, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's also not a burner, but he knows how to steal a bag. The reason he got drafted so late is that he had a 27.7% K% this year in college, but it came with a 16.8% BB%, and it was much better his sophomore year with a 17.1% K%, so it's not like he has some definite fatal flaw there. The fact that he had a 13.5% K% in his pro debut is also a great sign. He might not be a world beater, but DeMartini is a very, very interesting later round college bat for deeper leagues. He's a definite target late in the draft. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/18/69/.253/.321/.422/12

93) Yassel Soler - ARI, 3B, 19.2 - Soler's production in rookie ball isn't all that impressive with a 97 wRC+ in the DSL in 2023 and a 105 wRC+ in 53 games at stateside rookie in 2024, but he has a swing/hit/raw power combo that you want to bet on. He has a quick and powerful righty swing from a strong 5'1l'' frame that definitely looks the part. He also makes a ton of contact with a 17.2% K%. He hits the ball on the ground too much (50.3% GB%), so the 6 homers in 55 games isn't impressive, but his hard hit ability still led to a .303/..351/.472 triple-slash. He's a long way off and the upside probably isn't truly huge, but you can easily envision a pretty enticing hit/power combo prospect in a couple years. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/22/76/.262/.319/.436/6

94) Eddie Rynders - PIT, 3B, 19.5 - Selected 229th overall (and signed for slot value) in the 2024 MLB Draft, the best way I can describe Rynders' lefty swing is that it's a bit gangly, but it's definitely big and powerful at 6'2'', 195 pounds. He has legit power upside and he's a good athlete too. He struck out 7 times in 13 PA in the 2024 MLB Draft League, and while that is clearly a very small sample, I think it does foreshadow some possible hit tool issues in pro ball. He's a power first high risk, high reward high school bat. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 66/23/78.241/.313/.435/9

95) Wilfri De La Cruz - CHC, SS/3B, 17.6 - De La Cruz certainly looks the part at a very projectable and relatively broad 6'2'' with a smooth lefty swing that is geared for both average and power. The righty swing isn't as smooth, but you can see he's trying to drive the ball with that one too, not just slap it. He's known to have a good feel to hit and a solid plate approach, but it seems likely to me that this will end up power over hit at peak. He's also a good athlete who should at the very least contribute in steals as he fills out, and maybe more than that. Feel to hit, approach, size, athleticism, projection ... that is basically what you look for in an international prospect. De La Cruz is a good one. ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 77/23/79/.257/.338/.449/12

96) Alejandro Cruz - CHW, 3B, 18.3 - Cruz will already be 18 years old when he enters pro ball, which is a bit on the older side for the international class, although he's from Cuba and they don't seem to stick with that 17 year old timeline that other areas mostly do, so I wouldn't hold it against him too much. He's already a relatively imposing 6'3'', 180 pounds, and it certainly looks like he could end up being a real bruiser at the dish at peak. He's fast too though, so maybe he keeps a more a athletic physique to keep his speed. These are the type of guesses you have to make when talking about such young players. No matter how his body fills out though, his righty swing is damn fast and it's quick and short too, so he could have a pretty potent hit/power combo if it all comes together. Tack on that speed, and Cruz has plenty of upside to be a fun late FYPD lotto ticket. ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 72/21/76/.253/.326/.438/14

97) Ben Williamson - SEA, 3B, 24.5 - I was scratching my head on why so many people were so hyped up for Williamson last off-season, and to their credit, a 146 wRC+ at High-A and a 114 wRC+ at Double-A is good, but he was already 23 years old, and the .272/.365/.374 triple-slash with 3 homers and 15 steals in 95 games at Double-A is not very fantasy friendly. He hit 4 homers in 124 games all season. He doesn't lift, he doesn't pull, and while the hit tool is solid, it's not standout. This still isn't my type of profile, especially hitting in Seattle, but considering the solid year at Double-A and the solid glove, it's possible he could be a solid real life bat at peak. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/12/58/.256/.325/.392/9

98) DJ LeMahieu - NYY, 1B/3B, 36.9 - LeMahieu is a 36 year old coming off a season where he just put up a 52 wRC+ in 67 games. He put up a 99 wRC+ the year before. Not to be Mr. Obvious, but I would say the decline has arrived. The underlying numbers have declined right along with the surface stats with a .299 xwOBA in 2024. He still gets the bat on the ball with a 15.4% K%, and the 5.8% Barrel% isn't terrible, so he can still be a solid part time player. The Yanks 3B job is also currently open, so there is a still a path to plenty of at bats right now. 2025 Projection: 51/8/42/.250/.328/.385/2

99) Blaze Jordan - BOS, 3B/1B, 22.3 - I wasn't sure Jordan deserved to crack this list with his 2nd straight year of poor performance at Double-A (98 wRC+ in 89 games), but that 12.1% K% is still pretty impressive. He has good raw power despite hitting only 7 homers, and being 21 years old at Double-A is still on the slightly young side. He doesn't have much defensive value, but he can play a decent 3B, so it's not like he doesn't have any at all. I doubt he finds a role on the Red Sox, but I'll take a shot on his contact/power combo at this point in the rankings. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/18/76/.266/.315/.421/3

100) Franyerber Montillo - DET, 2B/SS/3B, 19.11 - I'm not sure Montillo deserves to crack this list after how hard he struggled once he got the call to Single-A. He was already 19 years old, so seeing him put up a 42 wRC+ with a 31.6% K% in 20 games is not a good sign. He looked really good in rookie ball with a 136 wRC+ and above average across the board production, but those numbers don't look as impressive after the immediate drop off at the more age appropriate Single-A. The reason he does crack this list though is because I just like the look of him at the plate. He's a pretty electric player at 6'0'' with some power and athleticism. He can also lift and pull it, so he should be able to get the most out of his power. And he's walked a ton in his career, even at Single-A with a 15.2% BB% at that level. I'll give him a pass for the struggles in full season ball because it's not like he was ancient at a relatively recently turned 19, and regardless of age, there is an adjustment period humans often have to make to tougher levels, new teams, cities, coaches etc ... Hard to say he's too sought after of a prospect, but there is something here that I definitely like a lot when watching him. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/17/66/.250/.330/.418/18

101) Larry Suero - COL, 2B/3B, 17.0 - Suero is 6'2'', 182 pounds with a sweet lefty swing, a good feel to hit, and good athleticism. Signing with Colorado is a double edged sword, as you get their ballpark at the end of the road, but you also get their poor development on the way to that. There isn't a ton of video out there on him, and he seems probably 14/15 years old in the video I have seen, but even the younger version of him had an athletic and sweet lefty swing, so it's not hard to envision legit offensive upside at 6'2''. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/22/79/.268/.334/.447/10

102) Paul DeJong - FRA, SS/3B, 31.8 - DeJong shouldn't be a starter, but I could have said that last off-season and he was a starter for a large chunk of the season, so maybe he can once again find a job this off-season. He still accrued only 482 PA by the end of the season, so 400-500 PA is probably a best case scenario. He's a lift and pull and nothing else guy, leading to 24 homers with a 32.4/4.8 K%/BB%. I shouldn't say nothing else, because he also has a very good glove, which is how he found a job last year. If he can do the same in 2024, he'll hit dingers but hurt you everywhere else. - 2025 Projection: 41/16/43/.221/.287/.412/2

103) Max Schuemann - OAK, SS/3B, 27.9 - Schuemann is a super utility player who has some fantasy friendly skills with speed (14 steals in 459 PA), lift (16.6 degree launch) and OBP (10.2% BB%), and Oakland has an open-ish job at 3B, so he can easily rack up a ton of at bats in 2025. The hit tool is the biggest issue with a 25.9% K% and .220 BA. He lifts it a lot, but he doesn't pull it enough with a 36.4% Pull%, and the 91.8 MPH FB/LD EV isn't great, so that is a recipe for a very low BA. The 89 MPH AVG EV and 5.6% Barrel% isn't bad though, so he definitely has some pop (7 homers). He's 27 years old and the K rates and hit tool were a problem even in the minors, so I don't think his supporting skills are good enough to overcome the at least below average hit tool. But if the hit tool can improve, and/or he finds his way into everyday at bats, he can definitely end up fantasy relevant. 2025 Projection: 46/8/35/.227/.309/.366/13

104) Gio Urshela - OAK, 3B, 33.5 - Urshela is as low of a win now option as it gets, but he could open the season as Oakland's starting 3B, so he cracks this list. He can get the bat on the ball with a 15.6% K%, and he has a solid glove, and that is about it. There are already rumors that Max Muncy will be competing for that job, and I'm sure they hope Muncy will win it. But if he doesn't, Urshela will be rolled out there. 2025 Projection: 42/10/53/.265/.303/.395/1

105) Yoan Moncada - FRA, 3B, 29.10 - Moncada seems to be getting some semblance of interest on the free agent market, and I guess it's possible he can kinda find a starting job if he signs with say the Blue Jays. Even there though, it's highly questionable if he would actually be their best option. He missed essentially the entire 2024 season with an abductor strain, and when he's actually been on the field over these last 3 seasons (not often), he just hasn't been very good with a 76 wRC+ in 2022 and a 98 wRC+ in 2023. On the plus side, he has a solid glove at 3B, and he's always hit the ball hard with well above average EV's and barrel rates, so he certainly has a chance to be an about average 3B overall. The fantasy upside is extremely limited with low homer totals, almost no stolen bases, and a mediocre BA for years now, and I'm definitely not interested in buying the decline years here, so he's a pure flier in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 42/11/45/.251/.318/.415/2

106) Jadher Areinamo - MIL, 2B/SS/3B, 21.4 - Areinamo is probably a utility infielder long term with one of the wackiest swings I've ever seen. I imagine if they ever drew Micky Mouse playing baseball, they would have him swing something like Areinamo. It's amazing that he has elite contact rates with that swing, but he does with a 11.1% K% and .301 BA in 110 games at High-A. He doesn't have big raw power with only 10 homers at 5'8", and he's not a burner despite 32 steals, so I don't think his fantasy value is huge. But if the elite contact rates stick in the upper minors, he'll be interesting for deeper leagues. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/9/42/.268/.321/.387/16

107) Damiano Palmegiani - TOR, 3B/1B, 25.2 - Maybe Palmegiani doesn't deserve to crack this list with a 82 wRC+ in 123 games at Triple-A as a 24 year old, but the power upside is in here if he works his way into a shot, which would make him fantasy relevant. He hit 19 homers with an 89.3 MPH EV, 19.4 degree launch, and a 53.6% Pull%. The .210 BA and 28.1% K% is why the wRC+ was so low, and that probably does limit is reasonable upside projection to a bench bat. He's a righty that didn't hit righties that well either (.648 OPS), so it's also a short side of a platoon bench bat. First Base seems especially weak to me up and down the rankings, so he also cracks this list purely on 1B scarcity (yes, I know these are the 3B Rankings). 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.218/.292/.400/0 Prime Projection: 36/12/42/.231/.316/.436/2

108) Ivan Melendez - ARI, 3B/1B, 25.4 - Melendez' hit tool is not nearly good enough to be an MLB regular with a 30.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 107 games at Double-A, but there is zero doubt this guy will rip dingers if given the chance with 22 homers, a 36.1% GB%, and 51.5% Pull% at 6'1'', 225 pounds. It might come with a BA under the Gallo line, but if you hit dingers, you have the potential to be fantasy relevant. A power bench bat seems to be a good scenario outcome for him. Hitting 30+ homers in a foreign league is another good scenario outcome. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 28/12/34/.219/.299/.428/1

109) Gage Miller - MIA, 3B/2B, 22.1 - Selected 92nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Miller was a standout Junior College player in his freshman and sophomore years, and then he transferred into the SEC and kept on raking, slashing .381/.474/.702 with 18 homers, 0 steals, and a 24/27 K/BB in 55 games. If he had a good pro debut, I could see liking him more, but his debut was rough, slashing .240/.305/.298 with 0 homers, 2 steals, and a 16.9/5.9 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's not a particularly toolsy guy and he's not particularly physical at 6'0'', 200 pounds. His strong amateur production and decent draft slot gets him on the list, but he's not a very interesting fantasy prospect right now. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 45/12/45/.253/.318/.402/4
