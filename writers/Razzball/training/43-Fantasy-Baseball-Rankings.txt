In an incredible turn of events, I’ve done all the infield 2025 fantasy baseball rankings. Less incredible, you’ve read them. It’s like that time your favorite team won because they played better than that other team but you convinced yourself they won because you cheered loudly. When I win the Fantasy Baseball Blogger of the Millennial in 2099, and my frozen head is accepting the award, I’m going to thank you, the readers, but I’m secretly going to be thanking myself. Without me, none of this would be possible. You’re a close second though! Okay, enough ranking of you and me, let’s rank some outfielders! Here’s Steamer’s 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Hitters and 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Pitchers. Subscriptions are up and running, and you can already get Rudy’s Draft War Room. Anyway, here’s the top 20 outfielders for 2025 fantasy baseball:

NOTE: All my 2025 fantasy baseball rankings are currently available on Patreon for the price of a Starbucks coffee, if you get one of those extra grande frappuccino jobbers. Don’t wait for the rankings to come out over the next month, and get them all now.

NOTE II: Free agents are marked as such and not yet projected. They are ranked for where they’re currently worth drafting.

NOTE III: Watch us discuss the top 40 outfielders:



1. Aaron Judge – Already went over him in the top 10 for 2025 fantasy baseball.

9. Jarren Duran – Already went over him in the top 20 for 2025 fantasy baseball.

10. Jackson Chourio – Already went over him in the top 20 for 2025 fantasy baseball.

11. Jazz Chisholm Jr. – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Doyle. I call this tier, “Dropping a rap diss so crazy the other guy sues.” Not sure how many of you are caught up on the Drake and Kendrick diss news. What, you don’t read World Star? Geez, free heads! You must sleep well. To catch you up, Kendrick and Drake were trading diss tracks, which is being nice to Drake. It was basically Drake released one, then Kendrick released, like, four in quick succession and one, Not Like Us, was so good it became the song of the summer. Then in November, Drake sued saying it was bots pushing the song up the charts. The song that was ubiquitous everywhere was a Russian bot farm. Not very convincing by Drake. Not Like Us was released on May 4th. That means for six months Drake’s representation tried to dissuade him from filing that lawsuit while offering reasons why the song was so popular besides the obvious: Everyone hates you, Drake. This is very funny. “No, man, everyone loves you, it’s the bots! The bots are pushing Not Like Us!” Very, very funny. Kendrick Lamar’s next diss song, The Streisand Effect, will teach Drake that a lawsuit against him is the best way to get Kendrick to do another diss song about him. Anyway, this tier is so good it will get people to sue because it’s too good.

As for Jazz, already went over him in the top 20 3rd basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

12. Ronald Acuña Jr. – This is a tricky We’re Back Era ranking because I don’t know when Tildaddy’s We’re Back Era will begin. Braves have already said that he won’t be back for Opening Day. Tildaddy is ready? Yes, we don’t know. About to start calling him Whendaddy. I ranked him this high because there’s no doubt that If-and-Whendaddy is Tildaddy, Thendaddy will be great. To talk less Seussian, when he’s back, I want him on my fantasy team. This could be the last chance to get him at a discount, which is kinda what I said before the 2023 season, when he went 41/73/.337, after he was coming off another knee injury. If I’m being realistic (which is no fun), how many knee injuries can he have before the Braves are like, “Dude, we like your exciting brand of baseball, but can you chillax on the steals?” I’m going to project the We’re Back Era starts for him mid-April and he’s his old self again, but I’d be lying if I didn’t think there was at least an outside chance he’s out until May-June and he’s more of a 20/30 guy upon return. Here’s hoping his We’re Back Era is so Back. UPDATE: Announced he wouldn’t run as much, so I had to lower him. 2025 Projections: 73/26/51/.269/24 in 441 ABs

13. Brent Rooker – First, feast your eyes:



Welcome to the Smoke Show. Last year, Rooker went 39/11/.293 and this year he’s in a minor league park for his home games. Daddy wants more of whatever is cooking in the kitchen. Some guys are so good batted-ball profile-wise that I’m more tempted to try to find fault, which is what I did with Rooker and I found very little. I guess the A’s might not provide a ton of counting stats, but he had 112 RBIs and 82 runs last year. Another issue might be his .362 BABIP, but look again at how hard he hits the ball. The only real drawback for some leagues is he doesn’t have outfield eligibility. So, play at Yahoo fantasy more! 2025 Projections: 86/36/105/.268/10 in 539 ABs

14. Oneil Cruz – Already went over him in the top 20 shortstops for 2025 fantasy baseball.

15. James Wood – In a half season, he went 9/14/.264. [Mr. Prorater breaks through the wall] There’s literally a door right next to where you broke through the wall! “Sorry. I was just excited to tell you James Wood would’ve went 19/28 last year in 162 games.” Yeah, tough to figure that out. Thanks, now leave. Through the door! James Wood, star of Salvador and co-star of Oliver Stone’s JFK, has one of the prettiest Statcast sliders I’ve seen. Just smoked all balls like in a gorge way. When sorting by 150 batted ball events, Wood was 16th best exit velocity and 14th best Hard Hit%. At 21 years old! Just absolute smoke show. Want stank on it? Wood will do it! 2025 Projections: 89/26/77/.272/25 in 556 ABs

16. Wyatt Langford – Coming into last year he was a lock for 20/20, then disappointed. OR DID HE?! Jesus, Mr. Reversal, take it easy, you’re wrong, Langford did disappoint. OH, SORRY. AT LEAST I DIDN’T BUST THROUGH THE DOOR LIKE MR. PRORATER. Langford went 16/19/.253. He was the 23rd best outfielder on the Player Rater last year, and around 100th overall. Not bad, and that was only in 134 games (499 ABs) as a rookie. If he stays on the field and doesn’t start slow, then he’s easily meeting expectations. HENCE THE ‘OR DID HE?!’ NO? No, he did disappoint, but he was close to not disappointing. GOT IT. MY BAD. That was with only a 20.6 K% and 9.2 BB% and a .296 BABIP, which seems incredibly low for a guy with his insane speed. Speaking of which, he could steal 45 bags if the Rangers let him. The floor here is 20/20/.260 which is basically returning value, but the upside is top five players in fantasy. Still buying, big-time. 2025 Projections: 86/22/83/.267/26 in 553 ABs

17. Jackson Merrill – Pretty sure that I have most of these guys flipped from their ADP, but one that might stand out the most is Merrill. I did this pretty straightforwardly. I said to myself do I want Merrill or Jazz or Cruz or Wyatt or Wood or Doyle and Merrill ended up here. All the guys in this tier ahead of him have 20/20 floors and Merrill has 25/15. Basically the same diff, but counting on power rather than speed worries me just a tad bit more, i.e., I’d draft Merrill, but only in theory since he’s ranked after guys who are below him in ADP. 2025 Projections: 88/27/86/.294/14 in 531 ABs

18. Brenton Doyle – Yeah, I know, Nolan Jones. Yeah, I get it, Bud Black. Here’s how I’m looking at it: Brenton Doyle is not coming off a great half season like Nolan Jones. He was not a rookie. Last year was his 2nd year when he went 23/30/.260. As for Bud, he’s played him for two seasons, so I don’t think he’s suddenly going to pull the plug and euthanize our dreams. Don’t love that Doyle’s 2nd half was demonstrably worse than his first, but easy 30-steal speed and cutting his Ks has me fully bought in. 2025 Projections: 80/25/76/.252/32 in 578 ABs

19. Cody Bellinger – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until the top 40 outfielders. I call this tier, “Goldilocks of adults.” This tier refers to me being a grown-ass adult and not acting foolish by ranking these guys too high or too low, but just right, like I’m the Goldilocks of adults. As for Cody, already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

20. Teoscar Hernandez – Re-signed with the Dodgers, as was the assumption when he said at the World Series, “I am a thousand percent staying with the Dodgers.” When he said that, you could almost hear his agent scream in slow motion. The only other person whose scream was in slower motion was James Outman. Sorry, James, you’re out, man. Also, Andy, it’s time to turn the Pages to a team that might actually play a rookie. This was the best place for Teoscar, obviously. Where else for a Teoscar than Hollywood? Plus, that stadium and lineup. If he stays in the lineup for 575 ABs, it’s hard to imagine a season that isn’t a top 20 outfielder year with zero upside. 2025 Projections: 81/34/94/.261/7 in 576 ABs
