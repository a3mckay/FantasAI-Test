15 Team Auction Draft: I Drafted Corey Seager, That’s Weird

So, a bunch of Razzballers got together for an auction draft at NFBC and I drafted a team that includes Corey Seager, and that’s where the weird begins. “Where the weird begins” also sounds like the title for every subreddit. If you showed me this team prior to me drafting it, I’d say, “Looks like crap, get it out of my face!” Actually, I’d prolly say, “Cool, nice team,” but then I’d snicker! I’d snicker something awful! Real passive aggressive shizz from me! Just a snickering fool! So many snickers until I’m self-satisfied. Then I’d shove your team away from my face and say, “Begone!” I would hate this team if it’s yours, and at least I practice what I preach because I hate this team as mine too! Alas, we must muster on. Musterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! For those not in the know, it’s a 15-team auction with two catchers that is a weekly league. Unlike a lot of NFBC leagues we play in, it is not draft and hold. There’s a $1000 FAAB budget with weekly pickups. For, ya know, when Corey Seager gets hurt. Is he hurt yet? Ha, I kid, I have Byron Buxton to carry my production! If you want to play against me and other Razzballers, join a Razzball Commenter League, it’s free! Anyway, here’s my 15-team NFBC auction draft:

C: Hunter Goodman – $1
1B: Christian Walker – $23
2B: Brice Turang – $12

3B: Luis Rengifo – $15
CI: Paul Goldschmidt – $11
MI: Willi Castro – $2
OF: Ronald Acuña Jr. – $30
OF: Parker Meadows – $15
OF: Lane Thomas – $8
OF: Jesus Sanchez – $5
OF: Byron Buxton – $3
UTIL: Alec Burleson – $5
Bench: Deyvison De Los Santos, Colson Montgomery

P: Roki Sasaki – $22
P: Ben Joyce – $13
P: Grayson Rodriguez – $18
P: Ryan Helsley – $18

P: Cody Bradford – $6
P: Andrew Painter – $1

OKAY, NOW WHERE IS YOUR TEAM?

That is my team.

THEN EVERYTHING YOU’VE TOLD ME IS LIES. I’M TAKING MY DISEMBODIED VOICE AND FINDING SOMEONE ELSE TO HAUNT WITH MY CAPITALIZED AND BOLDED WORDS. YOU’RE NOT WORTH MY TIME!

I know! I’m not happy with it either! The auction war room likes it (sorta):



[SOBBING] I DON’T CARE WHAT RUDY’S WAR ROOM SAYS! I HATE THIS TEAM!

Well, I do too! You know how they rate your team after the draft? It was rated well. That’s how I know how much this team sucks! I’m so doomed because it rated the best of any of my teams ever have rated! It’s all because of that stupid COREY SEAGER!!!

OKAY, DON’T STEAL MY SHTICK BY CAPITALIZING WORDS.

Sorry. But you have the bold thing too.

TRUE. OKAY, TALK ABOUT YOUR TEAM, YOU IDIOT.

So, I’m a bit concerned about strikeouts, if being honest. That’s why I drafted so many innings on my bench. I don’t know how Chris Bassitt on my bench is going to help when in my lineup Roki Sasaki goes 4 1/3 with 6 Ks. All during my top 20 starters and top 40 starters and–well, you know. I say repeatedly that I’m leaning into ratios over Ks, and I’ll be damned if that wasn’t what happened here. Clearly, I’m gonna have to do some work with this team’s pitching, but here’s where the rationalizations come from: People quit these leagues in July/August, and the easiest stats to gain on people is Ks and Wins, because people are no longer grinding. Even if six teams quit, that leaves extra two-start pitchers on waivers to FAAB. Also, Andrew Painter and Cody Bradford are bringing down my totals. My pitching if I replace Bradford and Painter with Bassitt and Cortes.



I personally like Bradford and Painter, that’s how the word ‘personally’ works, but the War Room doesn’t like them. Well, let me take that back, it might like Painter, if it thought he was going to throw enough innings. I also don’t know if he breaks camp, and am not expecting it, but we drafted in January, and crazy things can happen from then until April. Crazy things like Ben Joyce has already lost his job, so that was a complete waste of $13 and, if I were to re-run my War Room totals, it would no longer think my saves are great.

A flyer on Painter (for 10% off the first coat), Deyvison De Los Santos or Colson Montgomery isn’t the dumbest thing. If any of them look good in March, they’ll be double-digit if not triple-digit buys in the first FAAB period if they were on waivers. Can you imagine if Painter looks lights-out in March and breaks camp what his FAAB will be? Talking roughly $500.

I WILL SAY YOU’RE BETTER AT RATIONALIZATIONS THAN FANTASY.

Thanks.

IT WAS NOT A COMPLIMENT.

As for the hitting, I think I’m going to roster a lot of shares of Acuña. Said this numerous times before, but people forget how long the season is. If Acuña is back May 1st, he could be a top 15 player, easily. Not for the final five months, I mean by the time of the season’s conclusion, he’s better than all but 14 other players. If he’s back May 1st, I’ll be ecstatic. I can piecemeal a replacement outfielder for him until May 1st too. I could move Burleson into his spot and just pick up a hot bat off waivers for a few weeks. Or move Burleson up to OF and try Colson or whoever. As for Seager, Goldschmidt and Buxton, a crapfecta of players I don’t like but came at solid prices, they’ll be fine, I hope. I need basically their 75th percentile output. If Seager gives me 27/80/.275, I’ll be fine. If Goldschmidt gives me 17/8/.250, I’m okay with it. If Buxton gives me 100/400/4, then incredible! That’s games played/at-bats/curses spewed by me each time he hits the IL.

GREAT, THAT IS A SUPER POSITIVE NOTE TO END ON. YOU DIDN’T EVEN MENTION LUIS FREAKIN’ RENGIFO. MORE LIKE LUIS REN-GTFO WITH HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM!
