Giving you a big picture, generalization here: The top 80 outfielders are the end of the outfielders you’re looking at in your 12-team mixed leagues, and tomorrow will be for deeper leagues, so we’re at the beginning of the end of the hitter rankings in the 2025 fantasy baseball rankings. But as you know, a generalization makes a general out of I and Zation. Hmm, sounded better in my head. Here’s Steamer’s 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Hitters and 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Pitchers.

Subscriptions are up and running, and you can already get Rudy’s Draft War Room. Anyway, here’s the top 80 outfielders for 2025 fantasy baseball:

CONTINUE BACK TO THE TOP 60 OUTFIELDERS FOR 2025 FANTASY BASEBALL

61. Garrett Mitchell – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Fitzgerald. I call this tier, “Making the Ozzy Osbourne devil horns with fingers.” This tier refers to how rocking you feel after making one of these picks. Just general vibes are off the charts with these guys. You could convince yourself you just won the league at the draft with one of these guys. Then you might want to drop them by April 3rd. This is upsidey and downsidey. Rock on! [bites head off chicken tender]

As for Mitchell, him and Jesus Sanchez are in separate tiers (because Mitchell has less of a track record of actually playing) but aren’t that dissimilar. Mitchell also has a lot of things to be excited about, and, at the end of the day, little to show for it. At a certain point, guys kinda should not only “seem like they could be good,” but also “actually good.” I’m looking at Royce Lewis, too. Mitchell feels like the reason why we shouldn’t take what a guy did in 116 games across three seasons and just assume that’s what he’s going to do if he gets 116 games this year. “Yeah, that’s not even prorating. I’m not sure what it is.” Thanks, Mr. Prorater, you don’t need to chime in. “Lucky I don’t prorate out your attitude.” 2025 Projections: 58/12/64/.241/22 in 424 ABs

62. Jung Hoo Lee – Some of the guys in this tier are, “What could they do with 150+ games? A dream, that’s what they could do! But secretly I know I’m not gonna get anything,” but Jung Hoo is more, “He should be valuable without any huge upside if he plays for 150+ games, and not-so-secretly he didn’t play last year or the year before in Korea when he had a broken ankle.” Hoo Lee? More like, “Hoo boy, stay on the field.” 2025 Projections: 81/8/52/.288/14 in 571 ABs

63. TJ Friedl – His last season’s start was delayed with a non-displaced wrist fracture, and I think that might be where his season ended. His best power month was August and best average month was September with a low BABIP (.229). The bigger issue is Friedl makes some of the worst contact anyone’s ever seen. His BABIP is low, but he’s around a .250-.260 BABIP guy neutrally, which is incredible for a guy with 30-steal speed. His Launch Angle is 16.7 degrees, and someone needs to reteach Friedl about Charley Lau. Friedl does have speed and power though. 2025 Projections: 77/16/62/.243/25 in 492 ABs

64. JJ Bleday – Already gave you a JJ Bleday sleeper. It was written while painting clouds on my bedroom wall. 2025 Projections: 76/27/82/.252/5 in 551 ABs

65. Ceddanne Rafaela – Already went over him in the top 20 shortstops for 2025 fantasy baseball.

66. Tommy Edman – Already went over him in the top 20 shortstops for 2025 fantasy baseball.

67. Tyler Fitzgerald – Already went over him in the top 20 2nd basemen for fantasy baseball.

68. Jo Adell – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Walker. I call this tier, “Downloaded Waxahatchee off someone’s recommendation.” I didn’t know if Waxahatchee was a rapper, a gospel album, a self-help guru. I didn’t even know how to spell it. I still don’t, if being honest, just liberally using the copy and paste. When you download new music off someone’s recommendation and you don’t know if your tastes align, you might end up with a song or two you like but it’s tough treading through an album of songs you don’t know or care about. That’s this tier. I’m recommending these guys, but you might get only one decent guy and their promise is vague, but there (I think). They’re supposed to be good! (Key words are ‘supposed to be’.) For what it’s Cronenworth, 365 is a good song from Waxahatchee, if that’s how you spell it.

As for Adell, this was the point in the outfield rankings when I realized outfielders were shallow for how many you need to draft in your league. I had Adell lower after seeing he hit .207 last year, but he actually ended up higher than this on the Player Rater, so I moved him up. Then I thought about how these stats 54/20/62/.207/15 in 405 ABs ended up higher than this at the end of the year for outfielders and I shuddered. He also had a .244 BABIP and 27.9 K% and, man, he hits a lot of weak fly balls. He did have a 115.6 MPH max velo, which is elite, so maybe this is the year it all clicks. Never heard that before! (Kinda like Waxahatchee.) 2025 Projections: 63/24/72/.227/15 in 477 ABs

69. Evan Carter – His average exit velo was 86 MPH and he didn’t have any max velos to point at to be excited about. Geez, with compliments like this who needs insults, huh? The good news with Carter is he’s 22 years old and was a highly touted prospect. Last year was awful, awful, awful, awful, awwwwwwful, but it might’ve just been rookie hiccups. Hold your nose, drink some water and let’s go! UPDATE: Didn’t make the team. 2025 Projections: 64/12/61/.254/16 in 482 ABs

70. Jordan Walker – No one’s had their chain yanked in a non-sexual way more than Walker, and he’s still only 22 until May, i.e., it could all come together this year. What’s that, I could be saying that for the next five years? Yes, I might. I’m sorry, but a righty with his power could be incredibly special. Why do I specify a righty? Because he will face everyone and not have platoons, if it comes together. Walker could still be a 35/12/.260 hitter. I believe. 2025 Projections: 66/18/73/.261/6 in 476 ABs

71. Jonny DeLuca – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Larnach. I call this tier, “Waxachoosetts?” The last tier was Waxahatchee and you didn’t know what or who you were getting, this tier is even more confusing outcomes.

“Are you saying Massachusetts?”
“No, I’m saying Waxahatchee!”
“Waxachoosetts?”
“Sure, whatever, I give up.”

That’s this tier. Pure “I don’t know,” but with a chance for something decent.

As for DeLuca, mentioned this a bunch in the year-end recaps, but I know a lot of you check out before I do those, so this is new for you and I will be punishing those of you who read everything. Sorry! What I said a lot of was last year felt like a year where we saw more low BABIPs and decent K-rates on guys with decent speed. Why is that significant? It means a guy is making extremely terrible contact and, if it happens enough, it leads me to believe the ball was dead on the inside like your Uncle. With that said, that seems to be DeLuca to a T. Or, better yet, his contact is terrible even if the ball is on a tee. He does have 12-homer power and 30-steal speed, so, well, it’s a flyer. 2025 Projections: 59/10/63/.226/22 in 463 ABs

72. Nolan Jones – All the Waxachoosettses (Waxachoosettii?) are trust falls, but there might not be a bigger trust fall than a guy who just went 3/5/.227. That was in a half season. NoJo might be short for No Joke, you suck. Jesus and Mary Chain, Jones was bad last year, but his walk rate (12.1) was fine and he’s in Coors, so, yeah, maybe he goes 15/15 and is sat vs. lefties. This tier is flyers for the last rounds in a 12-team mixed league, to give you an idea where we’re at. 2025 Projections: 56/16/52/.232/12 in 432 ABs

73. Jacob Young – He was caught stealing 10 times last year and I’m convinced Davey Martinez just doesn’t give a flying eff if his guys get caught or not. It’s an aggressive game-play like when you were a kid and ran through every stop sign on the basepaths until you reached home or were tagged out. So, Young could steal 45 bags or 30, depending on how often the ball is thrown just in front of him for the tag. 2025 Projections: 72/3/41/.254/35 in 490 ABs

74. Roman Anthony – Already gave you my Roman Anthony fantasy. It was written while making gelato. One word about this ranking, I like Anthony a lot for a flyer in the last round of a 12-teamer, but you absolutely might drop him the day before the season starts, and I will be moving him down in the rankings if he doesn’t break camp. 2025 Projections: 44/12/41/.266/16 in 327 ABs

75. Matt Wallner – He had a 31.3 K% in Double-A at 24 years of age. I am cackling very loud. At 26 last year, he had a 36.4 K% in the majors. I am holding out a thumb, hitchhiking away from him. Then, I’m seeing his exit velocity and getting out at the first stop sign and walking back to him. He had a home run at a 53-degree Launch Angle, the highest in the Statcast era. Wallner succeeds in spite of himself. Except vs. lefties. He doesn’t succeed vs. them at all. 2025 Projections: 48/17/54/.233/4 in 376 ABs

76. Trevor Larnach – You ever win money on roulette? Okay, imagine you took all your winnings and left it there to ride. Then again. Then again. Until you finally lost. That’s what it feels like to be a lefty playing for Baldelli. Larnach has a solid batted ball profile, looks like he could be sneaky valuable, and he won’t ever top 410 ABs because of Baldelli. 2025 Projections: 54/17/58/.266/5 in 377 ABs

77. Brandon Marsh – This is a new tier. This tier goes until the top 100 outfielders. I call this tier, “No empty promises.” “The most annoying players to draft are ones with upside! I hate those guys!” If this sounds like something you might’ve said, I have just the tier for you. As I’ve said numerous times, if you’re in a deeper league, safer but boring might be desired. This would be that tier vs. the previous tier, but the further you move down in the rankings, the harder it is to find decent and safe, and you might be looking at more like “safe to give you less than ideal stats.” This was exactly the same tier as last year, which also started with Marsh, and welcome to my echo, echo, echo, echo, echo chamber.

As for Marsh, I don’t mind him, but mostly because he has a ZZ Top beard. Oddly enough, Marsh looks like he has swamp ass. What I don’t like as much is that he gets 400+ ABs every year and hits exactly meh.  Call him Brandon Mehrash. Actually, don’t. Sounds like you’re pointing out to a doctor your rash. 2025 Projections: 53/15/60/.245/15 in 409 ABs

78. Jesus Sanchez – This part of this Bored-a-rino tier could be a subsection named, “Sneakily not sexy.” These guys seem upsidey, and, who knows, maybe they will be, there is reasons to think they might be upsidey, but their stats, at the end of the day, and after each clause set off by commas, is kinda boring. Jesus’s sandals and Statcast got me flip-flopping. I can see how good Sanchez looks, but also: His stats are yawnstipating. Also, Part II: There’s More: I almost wrote a sleeper for him. His peripherals really are pretty, but again: He has 32 homers in his last 939 plate appearances. That’s hilariously pathetic. UPDATE: Will start the year on the IL with an oblique strain and is expected to miss four weeks. On the 7th day, God gave his boy an oblique strain, instead of resting, because he had restless hands. Stop tinkering, God! 2025 Projections: 45/15/46/.251/6 in 394 ABs

79. Brendan Donovan – Already went over him in the top 20 2nd basemen for fantasy baseball.

80. George Springer – I should bookmark Springer’s stats from last year so every time I say something like, “This player got old, you can tell by looking at his stats…” Then show Springer’s stats. Could also do that with Arenado. 2025 Projections: 68/16/52/.223/15 in 511 ABs
