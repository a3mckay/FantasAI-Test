We’re deep, deep, deep, and these guys might not be playable. The top 100 outfielders for 2025 fantasy baseball are your flyers in most leagues, and your 5th and 6th outfielders in deep leagues. Keep in mind, we have NL-Only rankings, and AL-Only rankings. If you have no need for these outfielders in your league, think on the bright side: Next up in the 2025 fantasy baseball rankings is starting pitchers. Here’s Steamer’s 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Hitters and 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Pitchers.

Subscriptions are up and running, and you can already get Rudy’s Draft War Room. Anyway, here’s the top 100 outfielders for 2025 fantasy baseball:

NOTE: All my 2025 fantasy baseball rankings are currently available on Patreon for the price of a Starbucks coffee, if you get one of those extra grande frappuccino jobbers. Don’t wait for the rankings to come out over the next month, and get them all now.

NOTE II: Free agents are marked as such and not yet projected. They are ranked for where they’re currently worth drafting.

NOTE III: Watch us discuss outfielders 41-100:



CONTINUE BACK TO THE TOP 80 OUTFIELDERS FOR 2025 FANTASY BASEBALL

81. Mike Yastrzemski – This tier started in the top 80 outfielders. This tier ends at Vierling. I called this tier, “No empty promises.” This whole tier is, “Do I really have to rank them?” Well, I’m here to sadly nod and sigh. Carl’s Jr. Jr. actually is a steal this late, but tell that to the person who is drafting them. 2025 Projections: 62/17/59/.228/4 in 425 ABs

82. Sal Frelick – He was a sleeper for me last year, which is also why I just slapped myself. “Snap out of it, Grey!” That’s me yelling into the mirror dressed as Cher in Moonstruck. So, Frelick had a HardHit% of 18.3 and that I find incredibly funny. Thank you for cheering me up. 2025 Projections: 57/3/31/.254/15 in 403 ABs

83. Starling Marte – Here’s a guy I’ve never heard of before. [sounding out his name] Staaahrrrleee-guh. So, Marte is no spring chicken and he no longer plays more than 100 games. Therefore, ergo, yeah, he’s fine for 85 games. 2025 Projections: 51/8/54/.258/15 in 324 ABs

84. Jesse Winker – Re-signed with the Mets. Debated if I wanted Marte or Winker first in the rankings for longer than I care to admit (four seconds), and went with this order because maybe Marte gets into a throwback 25-steal season where if Winker was anymore boring, he’d be Jesse Eyes-Just-Shutter. 2025 Projections: 53/12/56/.244/10 in 356 ABs

85. Matt Vierling – Already went over him in the top 20 3rd basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

87. Chase DeLauter – Already gave you my Chase DeLauter fantasy. It was wereitten…witten…written! UPDATE: Sidelined roughly three months with core surgery. He was removed from the rankings. 2025 Projections: 47/14/53/.266 in 312 ABs

87. Emmanuel Rodriguez – This is a new tier. This tier goes until Goodman. I call this tier, “Grab That Fake Dollar Player!” So, imagine you’re in one of those game show telephone booths that has 100 MPH winds and money shoots up and you have to grab as much as you can. Okay, instead of money, it’s fake dollars with player’s faces on each. You grab one screaming for joy, then you go to the bank, try to cash them and the bank says, “This dollar bill has Jose Siri’s face on it, we’re calling the police, you counterfeiter.”

Already gave you my Emmanuel Rodriguez fantasy. It was written while running a red light on a Bird scooter. 2025 Projections: 41/11/38/.231/16 in 324 ABs

88. Zac Veen – Already gave you my Zac Veen fantasy. It was written in November. 2025 Projections: 32/5/30/.231/22 in 302 ABs

89. Heston Kjerstad – I think I might’ve missed that he had rookie eligibility still, because I would’ve done a rookie outlook post for him if I knew. ACKSUALLY, does he? He has 129 at-bats across two seasons and I think his service time might’ve expired. I don’t know, tee be aitch. Any hoo! Doesn’t matter. If Kjerstad, what I previously believed to be the capital of Aruba, were to play, he has huge power. ROY G BIV says he won’t be directly affected by the O’s moving in the fences, but he will be affected by the O’s building up a great farm system then never playing them (or trading them; are they hoarders?). 2025 Projections: 27/10/24/.241/1 in 216 ABs

90. Parker Meadows – Already gave you my Parker Meadows sleeper. It was written while photocopying my butt. UPDATE: Dealing with a nerve issue that’s making it hard to pin down a timetable. I’ve shaved 15 games off his projections for now. 2025 Projections: 37/10/34/.258/15 in 306 ABs

91. Ryan O’Hearn – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

92. Pavin Smith – Pavin Smith vs. Trevor Larnach will be interesting to check back in at the end of the year. Both seem excellent on the batted ball profile, both are lefties so likely platooned, and Trevor Larnach is liked by everyone, including me, better, but maybe there’s more to Pavin, i.e., the road less traveled. 2025 Projections: 41/14/48/.242/2 in 302 ABs

93. Jose Siri – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Traded to the Mets. Honestly, not sure how I feel about this move. If only I had an AI assistant on my phone to help me formulate my opinion. Siri is 4th outfielder with or without Soto. “Looking for 4th outfielders in your area and found myself.” Don’t be cute, Siri, it’s uncanny valley creepy.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 34/14/37/.204/12 in 305 ABs

94. Johan Rojas – Workshopping something: “Don’t get caught redhanded so make sure you don’t draft Rojas!” Pretty good. Now, what if I want to draft him for his steals? Hmm…”Talk to the Johan, because your fantasy team’s needs care.” Damn it, that’s good too. 2025 Projections: 45/4/36/.248/28 in 316 ABs

95. Leody Taveras – Thanks to confirmation bias, everywhere I look I see guys who should have higher BABIPs. Confirmation bias: When anything you think is correct, is correct. Leody, my favorite guy who sounds like he was in the Heaven’s Gate cult, looks like (if I squint hard enough, confirm enough of my biases) a guy who could go 15/25/.270 and be very valuable. Has he ever approached those numbers? No, not remotely. 2025 Projections: 33/6/37/.254/15 in 303 ABs

96. Hunter Goodman – Already went over him in the top 20 catchers for 2025 fantasy baseball.

97. Jake Fraley – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until the end of the post. I call this tier, “A skit on The Marshall Mathers LP.” The Marshall Mathers LP is a good album, the skits suck.

As for Fraley, hey, one love, and guys can only do so much for their counting stats, but Fraley just had a season of 116 games and he knocked in 26 RBIs. Oh, and only 44 runs! Did he get 350 ABs out of the mysterious ten-hole that doesn’t exist and only takes place after games when there’s no one on base or in the stadium? No, I’m sorry, he hit mostly 5th! He hit fifth and knocked in 26 RBIs! Holy crap. That seems impossible. Oh, and he hit .277! How did he pull that off? 2025 Projections: 42/7/38/.264/19 in 361 ABs

98. Alex Verdugo – Signed with the Braves. They must’ve lost a bet. Unless. Dot dot dot. Braves have in their minor league system a Will Verdung, and now a Verdugo. If they sign a Verdungo, then they’ll have the set. Think this hurts Bryan De La Cruz, but might hurt Kelenic a bit too. Let’s face it, none of these guys are worthwhile in all but the deepest of leagues. 2025 Projections: 43/12/47/.258/4 in 355 ABs

99. MJ Melendez – His last three years of homers: 18, 16, 17. Clearly, his next season will be 19 or 15, and then the pattern will emerge. This was brought to you by me writing numbers on a window like A Beautiful Mind. 2025 Projections: 48/19/54/.221/5 in 429 ABs

100. Michael Conforto – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Dodgers. Welp, they’re not all good signings. I kid, I kid. Take it easy — oh, c’mon, Dude, no more Eagles! So, Conforto hits 20-ish homers and nothing else. He’s going to fit right in with the Dodgers because Conforto also likes to get one shoulder surgery per year.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 51/21/58/.231 in 405 ABs

101. Christopher Morel – Already went over him in the top 20 2nd basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

102. Jhonkensy Noel – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

103. Jake Meyers – Trying to choose who to rank first between Chas McCormick and Jake Meyers was one of my hardest decisions of my life (that I made in less than three seconds). I grappled with my thoughts. It was like Foxcatcher but with smarts. In the end, I chose to go with the guy who was better last year. 2025 Projections: 54/11/57/.225/10 in 431 ABs

104. Jarred Kelenic – I give Baldelli a lot of crap for benching lefties vs. lefties, but ya know what’s worse? When I want the guy benched vs. everyone. Kelenic also is sadly on a team with a lot of mouths to feed. Might’ve been optimistic about his projected ABs, and his stats are still pretty pathetic. Go back and laugh at the prospect hugger in your league who held Kelenic three years ago when he could’ve traded him for a top player. 2025 Projections: 38/14/41/.236/6 in 381 ABs

105. Max Kepler – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Phils. This is one of those moves that doesn’t seem that exciting for fantasy, but there’s gonna be a moment in August when you’re like, ‘Should I bench JRod for Kepler? I really should stop drafting JRod in the first round every year because he’s only good in September.’ And I’m gonna say, ‘Sure, go with Kepler,’ then JRod will hit six homers in three at-bats (don’t ask how) and you’ll vow to never draft JRod again until you draft him again in 2026, but at a discount, you rationalize. Any hoo! Kepler is fine if he’s hot on waivers.” And that’s me quoting me!  2025 Projections: 44/16/51/.246/1 in 372 ABs

106. Bryan De La Cruz – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Braves. This is actually a solid move, but of course. The Braves only make solid moves. Not even being sarcastic. When was the last bad move by the Braves? Trading Adam Wainwright, as a prospect, for one year of JD Drew? Prolly, and that was a full career ago for Wainwright. Don’t get me wrong, De La Cruz is still boring for fantasy, but it’s a solid real baseball pickup. If I’m the Braves, I let De La Snooze play until Acuña returns, then platoon him with Kelenic.” And that’s me copying and pasting me! 2025 Projections: 40/13/39/.235/4 in 338 ABs

107. Andrew Benintendi – <sarcastic>You know the dead giveaway to you really getting some great stats from a player?</sarcastic> When you see their projections, and you hope they get less at-bats. UPDATE: Out four-to-six weeks with a non-displaced fracture of his right hand. 2025 Projections: 47/12/42/.251/5 in 433 ABs

108. Daulton Varsho – Almost exactly the same stats as Jo Adell every year, only he lacks, “This guy is going to break out in such a huge way that you’re gonna be blown away, that’s how good he is. Trust me,” for the last seven years. Varsho did have that for one year, but not seven like Adell. Plus, that one year for Varsho was mostly contingent on his catcher eligibility. No one loves a guy with catcher eligibility with no chance to catch that particular season like fantasy baseballers (<–my mom’s term). For what it’s Cronenworth, Varsho was ranked right around Adell in the top 80 outfielders until I started seeing unfavorable timetables for his return from shoulder surgery. 2025 Projections: 48/15/41/.219/12 in 381 ABs

109. David Fry – Already went over him in the top 20 catchers for 2025 fantasy baseball.

110. Chas McCormick – I didn’t think Jake Meyers was good, and I ranked him in front of Chas. Insert an emoji that is smiling so widely that its cheeks begin to bleed from the creases, and tears fall rapidly from its eyes. 2025 Projections: 38/11/44/.220/11 in 396 ABs

111. Tommy Pham – UPDATE: Signed with the Pirates. Now we just have to get him in a fantasy football league with Pirates’ owner, Bob Nutting. Let the slaps begin! Last year the Pirates benched Isiah Kiner-Falefa on the last day of the season to save themselves a $200K bonus. Imagine that again but with Tommy Pham. We’re gonna see Tommy Pham go Milton Bradley into the broadcast booth but into the front office. 2025 Projections: 52/10/41/.242/10 in 449 ABs

112. Alan Roden – Will break camp with the Jays. Went into camp without a chance to make a difference, then he burrowed his way in. That’s Roden to a T. Convoluted pun alert, and you just missed it! Roden is a 10/10/.280 type, so your mileage may vary. Or rather since he’s a Jay, your kilomileage. 2025 Projections: 52/8/49/.262/12 in 409 ABs

113. LaMonte Wade Jr. – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

114. Kyle Isbel – Was between ranking Hunter Renfroe and Kyle Isbel and went with Scooby Doo’s favorite outfielder at first, “Renfroe!” but I looked at the Player Rater for last year and Isbel edged him out there, so went with him. Fascinating, I know! Almost as fascinating as Kyle Isbel. 2025 Projections: 66/10/43/.230/12 in 405 ABs

115. Amed Rosario – Already went over him in the top 20 2nd basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

116. Tyrone Taylor – I have a special place in my heart for Tyrone Taylor because I had him in one deep league last year. It’s weird to have such fondness since I did terrible in that league and Tyrone Taylor sucked. Welp, the heart wants what the heart wants. 2025 Projections: 41/10/43/.233/10 in 339 ABs

117. Oswaldo Cabrera – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

118. Dylan Moore – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

119. Tirso Ornelas – You know Tirso Ornelas, don’t you? He was the guy from that one episode of Treme you watched. So, here’s what I do: Rank everyone I think will be in the top 500-ish, then I doublecheck that vs. Steamer’s projections. Any hitter over 400+ at-bats that I have NOT ranked is likely an oversight so I need to add them, or Tirso, in this case. Here’s what Itch said, “I play in a lot of deep leagues, and guys like Tirso have value there. I wrote about Ornelas a few times in 2024 for the stash list because I thought San Diego might as well give him a shot in their depleted outfield. David Peralta started hitting eventually and put the kibosh on that, but the 6’3” 200 lb Ornelas should be on the field a lot this spring after slashing .297/.367/.497 with 23 home runs and just 88 strikeouts in 128 Triple-A games. His chances to break camp as a lefty power bat who’s a solid corner defender will be in the balance as all off-season as San Diego navigates the market. Smart money suggests they’ll sign someone to handle left field, but it might still make sense to roster someone who costs nothing but can spell future LF signee and Tatis and mix in Tirso at DH once in a while. Maybe even mix in a left hook to Grey’s head.” I’m sorry, what? 2025 Projections: 43/14/47/.247/5 in 386 ABs

120. Mike Tauchman – Signed with the White Sox, so now if they win 100 games, Tauchman immediately becomes a 1st ballot HOFer. 2025 Projections: 41/7/38/.238/7 in 412 ABs

121. Austin Hays – Signed with the Reds. The Reds do one thing great and that’s prospblock. So, Steer moves to 1st base and CES to the bench? Okay, but why? What purpose does Hays serve? That’s different than your butler, Hays, who is serving you tuna salad that has accidental dolphin in it. That’s, “What porpoise does Hays serve?” I hate this move for fantasy, but, alas, no one asked me! By the way, did you hear the new album by Accidental Dolphin? Fintastic! 2025 Projections: 48/12/53/.263/4 in 421 ABs

122. Richie Palacios – When he starts going by Dick Castle, I will pay attention. 2025 Projections: 41/8/45/.232/17 in 337 ABs

123. Kris Bryant – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

124. Andy Pages – One of the hardest guys to rank. He had a very solid rookie season — 13/1/.248, 24.4K% in 403 ABs — with a 8/3/.356 season in Triple-A in 24 games. Dodgers also have $500 million in 2056’s money that says they could trade him and maybe Pages is on the Marlins by July. 2025 Projections: 28/8/26/.259/3 in 245 ABs

125. Joshua Palacios – Had to include the other half of The Palace Brothers. The Palace Brothers also sounds like two club kids from Jersey who are in their 50s and still go out every weekend dancing. “Clear the floor! A Palace brother wants to do The Worm!” 2025 Projections: 41/12/47/.228/5 in 367 ABs

126. Alex Call – This is my feeling every preseason with Alex Call, “Ooh…nice power, nice speed, and he makes great contact!” This is me by the 1st week of April, “So, he’s not really that good, huh?” 2025 Projections: 41/8/44/.221/8 in 368 ABs

127. Jeff McNeil – Already went over him in the top 20 2nd basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

128. Victor Scott II – Finally, a guy who could steal 40 bags who costs nothing in a draft! What’s that, he only stole five bags last year? You’re way too wrapped up in facts to be playing fantasy baseball. It’s a real shame you just read 45,000 words about it. 2025 Projections: 37/4/29/.205/27 in 371 ABs

129. Miguel Vargas – Already went over him in the top 20 3rd basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.
