This is the top 100 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball? This is the top 100 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball! Which means. Dot dot dot. This is the end of the 2025 fantasy baseball rankings. I can reclaim my fingers! Wait, I still have to do the top 100 overall and top 500 overall. Hmm, that was short-lived.

Subscriptions are up and running, and they come with our Fantasy Baseball Draft War Room, now for auction leagues, snake leagues, Best Ball leagues and AL-Only and NL-Only leagues.

Here’s Steamer’s 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Hitters and 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Pitchers. As always, my projections are included, and where I see tiers starting and stopping. If you want an explanation of tiers, go back to the top 10 for 2025 fantasy baseball and start this shizz all over again. Anyway, here’s the top 100 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball:

NOTE I: All my rankings are currently available on Patreon for the price of a Starbucks coffee, if you get one of those extra grande frappuccino jobbers. Don’t wait for the rankings to come out over the next month, and get them all now.

NOTE II: Free agents are listed as just that and not yet projected. Once a guy signs, I will write out their blurb and add in projections, or remove them, if they sign in an unfavorable place. They are ranked currently where I think they might be if they sign on for a full-time job.

NOTE III: Watch Bdon and I discuss the starter rankings:



RETURN TO THE TOP 80 STARTERS FOR 2025 FANTASY BASEBALL

81. David Peterson – This tier started in the top 80 starters. This tier ends at Lowder. I called this tier, “I’m using the milkrowave.” As for Peterson, one of the hardest guys to project is the guy who has a terrible season two years ago, then has a solid season for ERA last year with way worse peripherals. Peterson’s stats make no sense. If you see a 7.5 K/9, 3.4 BB/9, you should shudder. That came with a 2.90 ERA. Then his previous year was a 10.4 K/9, 4.1 BB/9 and you’re nodding along, but he had a 5.03 ERA, and you’re just shaking your head. Fine, take the flyer, but don’t pretend to know what to expect. 2025 Projections: 11-9/3.82/1.27/139 in 148 IP

82. Drew Rasmussen – His projected innings could be a misnomer. You know her, she taught you 8th grade algebra. Freakin’ Ms. Nomer, gave me a C. I told her there’s no such thing as C! I say Rasmussen’s innings might be a misnomer because if he gets 120 IP, great, but if it’s 80 IP in the rotation and 40 IP in the pen, then it’s a lot less useful. It seems like same diff, but think about this scenario: You need innings to keep pace with the person trailing you in strikeouts, are you holding the guy bouncing in and out of the pen or are you dropping him for a streamer? 2025 Projections: 8-7/3.46/1.07/122 in 120 IP

83. Dustin May – The Giant Human Carrot is back and ready to sprout value! No? Okay, fair. The Giant Human Carrot is back and he’s Dodgers’ starter number eight…? Nine? I see May being drafted about 40 starters after this and, to that I say, “What do you have to lose?” One thing to note when drafting this late, rankings mean so little. It’s more about what I think about each player. If you’re in a deep league and need innings, then you’re ignoring May for someone like Chris Bassitt. If I wanted upside and a dump truck of the color red, I’d go May. 2025 Projections: 7-4/3.57/1.14/88 in 97 IP

84. Rhett Lowder – Already gave you my Rhett Lowder fantasy. Frankly, my dear, you did give a damn. 2025 Projections:  8-12/3.84/1.24/135 in 154 IP

85. Chris Bassitt – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Kelly. I call this tier, “Six-sevenths of almost interesting.” You see 8.1 K/9, and you’re like, “Ya know what, that’s almost interesting!” Then you see a guy’s K-BB% and you’re like, “That’s gonna lose about 1/7th of an almost interesting.” Or a guy is almost interesting due to his last year and then you see he has a bad home park or a bad fastball or a bad something and he loses 1/7th of an almost interesting. That’s this tier, six-sevenths of an almost interesting starter.

In deep leagues (NL-Only or AL-Only, for unstints), this tier is a strong option because in those leagues waivers are scant and/or skank, and you need innings. If I do my top 500 correctly, this tier and every starter after here won’t appear draftable for 12-team leagues or shallower. We are roughly around 300 overall or later. This is your basic, old/boring starter tier.

As for Bassitt, he seems like a steal this late. Thinking the only reason he is ranked this late is because A) I’m a dumb dumb. B) See A. C) There’s no C. D) Check out A. E) Seriously it must be A. F) Have you tried option A? So, my big quarrels with Bassitt are his command went a bit sideways last year and he’s on the wrong side of 35. Does a 36-year-old regain lost stuff? Sounds so philosophical. Or to put it in terms like you’d hear at a vet, can this Bassitt go less woof? 2025 Projections: 9-10/4.08/1.34/167 in 176 IP

86. Brady Singer – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Traded to the Reds. You thought India going to KC hurt his value? Well, I ain’t Singer’ing a happy tune for Brady. Because they were in the news around the same time, I was surprised that Singer’s had a better career (for ratios) than Yusei. I wouldn’t have guessed that. Singer’s 4.28 ERA in 685 1/3 IP isn’t awful, but Cincy and his homer-proneness isn’t great. Not bad for a deep league, where you need IP, but Singer is a streamer in shallower.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 8-10/4.18/1.29/162 in 171 IP

87. Jameson Taillon – Welcome to the part of our program where guys have horseshizz peripherals but should pitch a bunch of innings. You yell in your head, “I need those innings to be tallying!” [in your head you hear ‘tallying’ repeating over and over again until you blurt out in your draft…] I’ll take Taillon! [a drip of sweat beads up on your forehead as you realize what you just did] 2025 Projections: 10-11/4.13/1.18/134 in 172 IP

88. Zack Littell – His peripherals were gorge — 8.1 K/9, 1.8 BB/9, 3.63 ERA. Littell, you come up Biggel. So, why ranked this low? His worst feature was his homers allowed, and in Big Stein, that’s a Biggel concern. 2025 Projections: 9-5/3.85/1.28/147 in 166 IP

89. Luis L. Ortiz – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Traded to the Guards. The L in his name is for Like. As in, I do. This is almost exclusively ‘I don’t trust the starter, but I do trust the Cleveland Starting Pitching Factory and everything they touch turns to something solid, except Triston McKenzie but that’s more because they can’t touch him, because he’s so skinny.'” And that’s me–well, you know. 2025 Projections: 9-8/3.79/1.16/121 in 152 IP

90. Ben Lively – See 1/8th of an inch above or six inches, if a girl is reading. 2025 Projections: 10-8/3.94/1.28/139 in 171 IP

91. Luis Severino – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the A’s. Luis Severino becomes a test case to see if the Mets have ‘We can fix you like Chris Martin sang he’d fix Gwyneth’ powers or if it’s just Chris Martin singing he’d fix Gwyneth, but instead causing her to start Goop and sell a bunch of new-agey crap and now I have a candle that smells of her vajayjay.” And that’s me copying and pasting me! 2025 Projections:  8-11/4.24/1.28/151 in 171 IP

92. Erick Fedde – I worked real hard to move Fedde into the “Broken emergency anchor glass” tier in the top 80 starters, because Fedde had a 3.30 ERA last year and a 2.6 BB/9, but the under 7.8 K/9 and iffy stuff had me unable to do it. The Legend of Fedde Wopped, still too fresh in my brain from his time in the league prior to his trip to Korea too. 2025 Projections: 9-11/4.07/1.22/141 in 168 IP

93. Andrew Heaney – Signed with the Pirates. Bob Nutting removing glasses, “Goodbye, Warby Parker, it’s time for my alter ego, Super Spend-Very-Little Man!” He then flies into City Hall asking if he can get the taxpayers to pay for Heaney. I kid, of course! This is a solid move for Heaney and the Pirates. It doesn’t put him on 12-team mixed radars, but he’s a solid flyer for deep leagues where you need some innings and to feel something. 2025 Projections: 8-11/4.09/1.27/144 in 142 IP

94. Dean Kremer – So, the Baltimore left field fences coming in isn’t gonna help him with all his fly balls and homers allowed, but what’s gonna happen? His home runs allowed are going to go from the third row in the seats to the 15th row? At end of the day, I’m fine with him in deep leagues, but because of the price, and this isn’t a strong endorsement. 2025 Projections: 10-9/4.12/1.27/144 in 158 IP

95. Clay Holmes – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Mets to start, which could work. I’m not sure there’s any way of telling for sure right now. He looks like he’s lacking another pitch to be successful, so it’s likely an uphill climb. I’d guess there’s as much a chance as they say he’s starting and we get to March, they sign someone else and Holmes is backing up Edwin Diaz. So, as a last round flyer in a 15-teamer? Sure. Anything else, you’re likely being too generous until we see something.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 7-9/4.12/1.34/134 in 131 IP

96. Jose Soriano – If you were to cover his name and tell me his stats are those of a starter on the Astros, I think I might’ve ranked him as a number four, i.e., much higher. Angels ruin everything they touch like the AL’s version of the Rockies. And their park isn’t even bad, which makes the Angels much worse. Player development is a mess; minor league system is not good; their park is bad for fans; their coaches aren’t good; their owner sucks; their GM might’ve been dropped on his head; they’ve become a team that goes out and gets guys who no one else wants because everyone else thinks they’re retired. Any hoo! Soriano’s under-the-hood stuff is interesting, but Angels will find a way to ruin him. 2025 Projections: 8-11/4.03/1.31/129 in 133 IP

97. Kyle Hart – Signed with the Padres. He was the winner of last year’s KBO, Cy Young-type award, the Chan Ho. I’m kidding about the name, but maybe I’m not. Is that who the award is named after? I’d google it, but Google no longer works. Can’t say I’m not a teeny bit intrigued by a guy who went 10.4 K/9, 2.2 BB/9 with a 2.69 ERA, 1.03 WHIP last year in 157 IP. But also the KBO is often compared to Double-A and, speaking of which, Kyle Hart had a 6.5 K/9 and 3.2 BB/9 in Double-A in 2018. He’s 32 and this feels more like a deep league flyer, at best. 2025 Projections: 8-10/4.08/1.27/134 in 152 IP

98. Merrill Kelly – He missed April through August with a shoulder strain, and the results were less than ideal when he returned, but his velocity was fine in September, and he doesn’t really rely on velocity to get guys out, so, yeah, he’s, uh, fine, I guess. Listen, we’re super late in the ranks at this point. If you need a flyer for innings, Kelly’s as good as any the other schmohawks in this area of the draft. 2025 Projections: 8-9/4.14/1.21/127 in 142 IP

99. Walker Buehler – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Miller. I call this tier, “One love.” The tier name refers to me saying, “One love,” before saying, “But I ain’t going near him.”

As for Buehler, here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Red Sox. Sadly, Buehler’s day off lasted six months last year, until the postseason. So, do you believe a random 15 innings in the postseason or 75 1/3 IP in the regular season? I tend to believe the 75+ innings, but here’s the thing: Neither the postseason nor the regular season were great below the surface. He had a 7.8 K/9 in the postseason and 7.7 K/9 in the regular season. Plus, 3+ BB/9 in the regular season, 3.0 in the postseason. Only thing that looks remotely better is the BABIP. That’s not all smoke and mirrors. He elicited weaker contact in the postseason. But guess what Fenway is going to kill him in? I think his name makes you think there’s more here than there is. If you’re a believer, hope he holds his postseason fastball zip, and his pants don’t rip, said like Nipsey Russell.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 9-11/4.09/1.33/136 in 153 IP

100. Luis Gil – Loved being in on him in the 1st half of last year. That was Joy City, Population: Me and Joy Behar. I was riding on top of a van like I was Teen Wolf just doing pure bliss. Things were good; we didn’t have cares. Just vibes. Then the 2nd half happened and the strikeouts are nice, but his command is awesome when you’re drafting him in the last round of a 15-teamer, but less awesome when you have to pay any sorta price. UPDATE: Won’t throw for six weeks with a lat strain. Went into the not-too-distant-past in my Wayback Machine to see who else had lat strains and how long those pitchers were out. Found one pitcher with Alfred E. Neuman on it that had a caption, “What, me thirsty?” at a garage sale my mom was having in 1997 and I had the worst acne and realized the Wayback Machine was totally broke. Can someone get me back from the 90’s? There’s so much hairspray here I can’t breathe. So, Eduardo Rodriguez had a lat strain in March of 2024, and missed basically the whole season, but he seems uninterested in pitching, and I think other things are going on in his life. Jared Jones had a lat strain last year; he missed about six weeks, but I think the Pirates might’ve also made-up that injury to control his innings. Luis Severino missed six weeks in 2023 with one, and Clarke Schmidt had one in 2024 and missed three months. Did I mention Clarke Schmidt? Yeah, he gets a boost. 2025 Projections: 8-6/4.23/1.31/121 in 104 IP

101. Kutter Crawford – The biggest difference between Kutter and Houck is a splitter that works damn well for Tanner and a cutter that underachieved for, well, guess who. By the way, Kutter’s parents named him Kutter after his best pitch is the best example of psychic ability shown by parents naming their kids since that Wyoming couple won Powerball by playing their kid’s name, Onefortysevensixteencrapuhfivethirtysix. Kutter, much like Tanner, should be able to perform this well, but also have a bit of upside that’s not readily obvious with other options in this tier. UPDATE: Won’t be ready to start the season, due to his knee, which was a problem since last April. That’s a concern, taking off 60 IP. 2025 Projections: 7-6/3.83/1.11/118 in 121 IP

102. Yu Darvish – He looks like he will be good for the rest of his career just won’t be healthy for much more than 120 IP a season. Try to jinx anything as bad as I just jinxed Darvish. He’s about to have a 5+ ERA as he pitches 175+IP after that large-scale jinx. Reminds me of the time I was about to get into a self-driving Waymo, saying, “What could go wrong?” I immediately canceled my ride and called an Uber. You can’t come back from that kind of jinx. UPDATE: Elbow inflammation. 2025 Projections: 6-6/3.48/1.21/107 in 104 IP

103. Cody Bradford – Already gave you my Cody Bradford sleeper. It was written–UPDATE: Has elbow soreness. No! My beautiful sleeper is now sleeping with the fishes. 2025 Projections: 6-6/3.67/1.11/96 in 109 IP

104. DJ Herz – One of the few starters who I barely ranked initially, then dug in more and moved him way up. It’s not all perfect under the hood; if it were, he’d be moved way up. Expected stats are goofy, but there’s something when a guy has an xBA of .208 and xERA 3.26. His command is pretty iffy and that’s more worrisome than just a guy giving up walks. That means he’s wild in the zone and he gives up homers or just hard contact. Also, his “good” stats were all in a very small sample of 88 2/3 IP. But so was Bowden Francis, right? Either way, this is late, and it’s an interesting flyer to take in case Mellencamp was right and Herz so good. UPDATE: Struggling all spring and might be ticketed for the minors to start the year. UPDATE II: UCL sprain 2025 Projections: 6-8/4.08/1.33/111 in 102 IP

105. Jeffrey Springs – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Traded to the A’s. Now, let’s get this straight, I’m supposed to imagine Springs is healthy because the Rays traded him to the A’s? Do you have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell me? But not the Brooklyn Bridge, but, like, a lesser known bridge, like, the Avocado Toast Bridge? Springs now becomes a guy I’d like to draft for other people in my league. Please, spend your auction dollars on Springs. I’m sure he’s healthy! The Rays traded him away, that’s a great sign for him!” And that’s me quoting me! Big time One Love with Springs. Taking Springs to the mattresses, but not to make love but like you’re a mafia don. He returned from Tommy John last year, pitched for 33 innings and was shut down with elbow concerns. Again, I’m asking you to keep that in mind when you’re drafting guys like Sandy Alcantara and Jacob deGrom. They could appear great in March, but June is far away, and September is years away in playing-baseball months. 2025 Projections: 4-3/3.62/1.33/86 in 81 IP

106. Brandon Woodruff – 16 months roughly from his shoulder surgery. He’ll be 32 and–hold on, I’m googling to see if pitchers use their shoulders. Hmm, Google AI is saying a shoulder is used for cars to yield. Google’s so good now! Woodruff is being drafted way higher than this, and, hey, good luck to you. My guess is in Spring Training we see a guy who has two miles off his fastball and looks a lot more like a 32-year-old, 4.00+ ERA pitcher than the guy before his surgery. Sorry, I am Mr. Bummer. 2025 Projections: 6-4/4.12/1.12/103 in 89 IP

107. Nestor Cortes – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Traded to the Brewers. Somehow, the Brewers will turn Nestor Cortes into an ace with a 11 K/9. Honestly, I remembered Nestor being much worse last year, but I was only recalling his postseason with the elbow injury, which, ya know, negates the good-ish season he had from April through August. I’m out, but hopefully the Brewers know more than me. I would’ve preferred Aaron Ashby in their rotation.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 6-6/4.18/1.28/97 in 107 IP

108. Bobby Miller – Imagine if the Dodgers could develop players and not just sign guys for a billion-point-two. According to Baseball Digest, the Dodgers last developed player from their farm system was Don Newcombe. If you’re another team sending the Dodgers your best, most expensive player for someone like Miguel Vargas, you know you’re getting took. 2025 Projections: 4-6/4.23/1.36/94 in 98 IP

109. Andrew Painter – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Leiter. I call this tier, “Saying romance into a glass bottle, then tossing it into the sea.” Putting a message in a bottle is rarely answered, it’s even more rare when someone just speaks words into a bottle and casts it off into the ocean. That’s this tier. The very rare chance for success. For what it’s Wuertz, this tier last year had Paul Skenes, Reynaldo Lopez and Bowden Francis. Damn, about to only draft from this tier. This is clearly the deep league, upside tier.

It’s hard to reconcile my feelings of seeing Paul Skenes, Reynaldo Lopez and Bowden Francis in this tier last year and not have some heart emojis for the guys in this tier. I’ll also say this, the guys who were in this tier last year who were buried by me, were buried by everyone. I promise you, if I ranked them here, I was not doing it in spite of Steamer projecting one of them for, say, a 2.40 ERA in 150 IP. With all that said, I don’t have strong feelings for the guys in this tier like I did last year. I really wanted to draft Reynaldo Lopez, et al, last year. This year? Sure, I’ll draft them, but the love isn’t as strong.

As for Painter, I could see the Painter flyer (10% off on the first coat?) and I don’t hate Jack Leiter or others if they figure out their shizz, but the guys in this tier feel more iffy than last year’s prospect-slash-huge-upside gambles. Also, just in general, I don’t love Rangers’ pitching prospects and there’s two anchoring this tier in 2025. Okay, now for Painter, for real! Underwent Tommy John and missed most of 2024, besides the Fall league. Here’s what Itch said recently, “At 6’7” 215 lbs with upper nineties heat and superb balance throughout his delivery, Painter is the platonic ideal of a power pitcher, featuring plus command of a plus slider and changeup along with the big fastball and developing curve. When he was last on the mound in 2022, Painter threw 103.2 innings across three levels and recorded a 0.887 WHIP, which solidified him as the best pitching prospect in baseball at the time. He could reclaim that oft-dubious throne (or share it with Jackson Jobe) if he comes back healthy in 2025, and I want Grey unhealthy in 2025.” What? C’mon! 2025 Projections: 3-3/3.56/1.12/91 in 78 IP

110. Tylor Megill – He had himself a nice season last year — 10.5 K/9, 3.7 BB/9, 4.04 ERA in 78 IP. He seems to be the type of guy that teams either lean on and he becomes very valuable — think Luis Gil last year. Or he’s relegated to middle relief and he doesn’t breakout until he’s on another team — think every Mets’ middle reliever who’s left the team in the past that they never gave a real chance. *cough* Seth Lugo *cough* 2025 Projections: 7-3/3.47/1.25/123 in 118 IP

111. Grant Holmes – You think I’m letting a potential recipient of the Shroud of Touki, making him excellent for one full season, pass me by? Oh, and I already looked at Ian Anderson, but he already had his super random solid season. Shroud of Touki works for one season, back to dookie the next season. (Don’t think I didn’t look at Dylan Dodd either.) 2025 Projections: 6-5/3.66/1.24/97 in 92 IP

112. Aaron Ashby – Do I trust Ashby? Not really. Do I trust the Brewers with pitchers? Yes. (For those wondering, I had more problems with Nestor because of his injury last year.) 2025 Projections: 5-2/3.56/1.12/94 in 84 IP

113. David Festa – One word about the projections here vs. the rankings in this tier. The projections are realistic expectations, the rankings are how I’d draft them because they are ranked with the best chance to exceed expectations, and “exceed expectations” is what you want if you’re going for a guy in this tier. Not like you’re drafting for realistic expectations if you draft David Festa. You’re looking to party, Karamu, Festa, forever. 2025 Projections: 4-5/4.19/1.31/117 in 104 IP

114. Kumar Rocker – Going from Festa to Kumar, forever! Sorry, that song is very catchy. One other note about this tier, in general, if these guys don’t break camp and are promoted sometime soon thereafter, it’s gonna be, “Damn, I only have $670 in FAAB left and I want to spend it all on this prospect pitcher who’s being called up! I need Kumar!” Yeah, that’s gonna happen, so if the league is deep enough that that FAAB predicament rings true, it’s smart to bid $1 in the auction or take a last-round flyer on a guy in this tier to just stash. 2025 Projections: 6-8/4.23/1.34/132 in 118 IP

115. Yariel Rodriguez – The positive feeling I had for Yariel when I saw his name was way more anecdotal than I thought, because I just looked at his stats and I was like, “Why did I like him? Am I bucket of dumb?” I might be, but — say it with me! — this is late and upside. 2025 Projections: 6-8/4.20/1.36/124 in 122 IP

116. Cade Cavalli – Here’s what Itch said, “Injuries and excellence mixed in with command issues has been the story for Cavalli, who makes an interesting flier in deep fantasy leagues entering 2025. When he’s right, Cavalli has a heavy, double-plus fastball and a trio of solid off-speed pitches (curveball, slider, change). He’s got a lot of pace and momentum in his approach and delivery, which can look pretty intimidating when he’s got the linebacker’s build (6’4” 240) in rhythm, maybe he can run over Grey.” What on earth? 2025 Projections: 6-9/4.37/1.38/109 in 102 IP

117. Hayden Birdsong – This is strictly a “Could be good” ranking, but he’s shown no ability to command his pitches, which is a theme for this tier, unfortch. 2025 Projections: 5-8/4.19/1.36/118 in 106 IP

118. Jack Leiter – Always cracks me up how a guy like Leiter will be highly touted, then he’ll come up, do awful in a very limited time, and people just flat-out forget about him after that. People really suffer from Shiny New Object Disease. I, sadly, am people. Leiter’s command makes me think he’d be best served in the pen, or if MLB changes the strike zone to a “broad side of a barn.” 2025 Projections: 5-8/4.67/1.42/117 in 109 IP

119. Ryne Nelson – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until the end of the ranks. I call this tier, “HalleBerrylujah!” The tier name is what I exclaim when I finish the ranks! These guys are not safe. A few are injured. They’re not worth the flyer, outside of the deepest of leagues.

As for Ryne, you might get some innings here if there’s an injury in the DBacks’ rotation that is duct-taped together and he had a decent 2nd half, ain’t that swell? If you don’t think it’s swell, you need to lower your expectations because you’re about 450 overall players into your draft at this point. The quote-unquote good pitchers are long gone. 2025 Projections: 6-3/4.28/1.28/99 in 106 IP

120. Andrew Abbott – This tier is mostly “Omitted but considered, but, on second thought, eff it, they’re slightly better than that.” Abbott might actually be even better, if he can ever find his minor league pedigree. His home runs allowed are hideous though, and, in Cincy, the stank of that lingers. 2025 Projections: 8-12/4.17/1.31/136 in 141 IP

121. Frankie Montas – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Mets. Irrelevant for us, but he’s making $17 million per year, after throwing 150 2/3 IP with a 4.84 ERA. If a time traveler is reading this, go back and tell Baby Grey to become a MLB starter, and I will give you 20% of my earnings. 20% of earnings for doing nothing but time traveling and whispering shizz to a baby? Dude, that’s a good deal! Ya know what’s not a good deal? Signing Frankie Montas. Unless you’re also getting Frankie Muniz, then I can be convinced otherwise. Any hoo! Mets have a nice track record of taking meh and making it decent, and his peripherals read more like a low-4 ERA pitcher than an unusable one.” And that’s me copying and pasting me! UPDATE: High-grade lat strain and will miss 6-8 weeks. 2025 Projections: 6-6/4.17/1.33/94 in 98 IP

122. Jose Quintana – UPDATE: Signed with the Brewers. There’s one team that makes cash-money out of no-cash-money pitchers and that’s the Brewers, so nice signing for him. It’s a good landing spot. Why the Mets didn’t bring him back after they lost the better part of their rotation? I don’t know but that will be discussed for years in Flushing barber shops, which is not barber shops where the chair is a toilet — though, pause, did I just invent something brilliant? Have Quintana projected for a 4+ ERA, but he does sub-3’s every year like a clock that only has threes on the dial, i.e., I’m likely underrating him. 2025 Projections: 9-9/4.24/1.29/126 in 161 IP

123. Max Scherzer – Signed with the Jays. Man, I don’t know. I kinda want Yariel Rodriguez, the guy who he likely bumps, over Scherzer. I don’t like Bassitt or Gausman, and I’d want either over The Hetero Man. As in heterochromia. Different eye colors. Not clear? Okay, maybe should’ve spelled it out. In reality, it’s likely Scherzer for 80-100 IP and Yariel for 80-100. Ranked Yariel higher because of upside, but this is so super late they’re all flyers. 2025 Projections: 6-4/3.88/1.18/93 in 98 IP

124. Justin Verlander – Signed with the Giants. That can be summed up with:



2025 Projections: 7-7/4.32/1.36/86 in 106 IP

125. Clayton Kershaw – Re-signed with the Dodgers, because of course he did. Now for how much he will actually pitch for them. 2025 Projections: 5-2/3.71/1.23/71 in 81 IP

126. Charlie Morton – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the O’s. Orioles are like, “Look at all our sexy hitters! Why are you looking at our pitchers? Stop looking at them…I said stop!” The Orioles and Mariners together would make one superteam aka the Dodgers. So, I wasn’t going to rank Charlie Morton, then went back and looked at the Player Rater to see where he ended up and it was 85th overall for starters (right behind Dean Kremer and Albert Suarez, ha), so Morton is draftable, if barely.” And that’s me–well, you know. 2025 Projections: 10-10/4.10/1.30/169 in 167 IP

127. Shane Bieber – Re-signed with the Guards, as he recovers from Tommy John surgery. He’s expected back (fill-in a date that is two months after you think, unless you think August or later, then, yes, then). 2025 Projections: 1-2/3.10/1.14/14 in 17 IP

128. Kyle Harrison – He’s been pretty bad in his time in the majors, but that doesn’t mean he will continue to be bad. [presses finger to ear bud] Hold on, I’m hearing it does mean he will be bad. Wish someone would’ve told me that before I said the opposite. 2025 Projections: 7-10/4.27/1.31/141 in 148 IP

129. Griffin Canning – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed by the Mets. Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, someone free Jo Adell now! Griffin Canning, your 2025 NL All-Star Game starter! I’m somewhat kidding, but it doesn’t hurt to acquire as many 170+ IP pitchers as you can for real baseball. Last year, his walk rate ballooned to 3.5 but it was 2.6 BB/9 the year before, and if he can get back to that, that’s good. Something I’d trust the Mets to pull off more than the Angels. Canning could finally achieve the success that has eluded him on the terribly-coached Angels.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 9-11/4.21/1.29/143 in 167 IP

130. Marcus Stroman – Can someone elicit an outsized response on Twitter from Stroman so he gets suspended and Clarke Schmidt is in the rotation? And that’s the first time Stroman and the word ‘outsized’ has ever appeared in same sentence. (Actually, use that dig to try to get him to say something he regrets.) 2025 Projections: 9-10/4.29/1.38/116 in 148 IP

131. Eduardo Rodriguez – He’s either giving you 150 IP of 4-ish ERA or 35 IP of a 7 ERA and the most random excuse for missing five months like, “EdRod can’t find a clean pair of underwear. The team has excused him from traveling with them on their upcoming road trip.”  2025 Projections: 8-8/4.39/1.36/137 in 149 IP
