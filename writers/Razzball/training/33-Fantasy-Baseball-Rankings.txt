Hello, all you brave, courageous, adventure-seekers, you’ve found the wrong website. This is fantasy baseball, not fantasy role playing, unless it’s fantasy roll-playing and this is Stratomatic, but that’s still not right. Still, fantasy baseball. Good, now that we got rid of all those people wearing fedoras and shopping from the Indiana Jones collection at Eddie Bauer, we can get down to the bidness. The Auction value bidness? Not quite, but you can find all auction values in Rudy’s rankings — one example, 12-team mixed league auction values. This is a top 100 for 2025 fantasy baseball. Let’s do this!

One word about this top 100 for 2025 fantasy baseball, before I give you another 5,000 words. I’m going to avoid repeating myself from the position rankings in the 2025 fantasy baseball rankings. If you want to know my in-depth feelings about a player, then you need to go to his positional page, i.e., the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball, the top 20 outfielders for 2025 fantasy baseball, the top 20 Patterns In Queso That Look Like Messages From Another Planet for 2025– Okay, but I almost got you. This post is meant to give you an idea where guys from different positions are in relation to each other. Since this post is only the top 100, there’s more players where this came from. 413 more, to be very exact. Next up, there will be a top 500 that will go past 500, then, after that, there will be a top 7,500 that will go to 8,602, then a top 25,000 that will go to 28,765, then a top 600,000 that will go to 892,121, until we end up with a top kajillion in April that will go to a kajillion and one. Or maybe I’ll stop at the top 500. Yeah, that makes sense. Not to get all biblical on you, but this is the gospel. Print it out and take it to Mt. Sinai and it will say, “Win your 2025 fantasy baseball league, young prematurely balding man.” Projections were done by me and a crack team of 100 monkeys fighting amongst themselves because there were only 99 typewriters. Somebody please buy Ling-Ling his own typewriter!

Razzball Subscriptions are also now open, which include the Fantasy Baseball War Room. I don’t draft without it, neither should you. Anyway, here’s the top 100 for 2025 fantasy baseball:

1. Bobby Witt Jr. – One guy goes 50/50! Another guy hits more homers in the AL than anyone ever and follows that two years later with 58 homers and plays in a Little League park! Which one is ranked first overall? Neither. Sorry, I hate spoilers too, but that’s not a spoiler, you’re reading the rankings. Literally, like, right now. After the top spot has been cursed for four of the last five years, I’m trying to be as conservative as possible with the top spot. Ohtani and Judge have the best chance to be the top guy overall or disappointing slightly, while Bobby Witt Jr. has the best chance to be a top five overall player with the lesser chance of disappointing or being number one. That’s right, I’m telling you to draft a guy number one who has less of a chance to be number one. And things get even dumber from here! 2025 Projections: 112/33/102/.314/37 in 611 ABs

2. Shohei Ohtani – Chipper Jones said Ohtani is generational. I take that to mean he’s the best player of this generation. If that’s true, which I believe it is. Think also about how each progressive generation gets better than the generation before. Hank Aaron was better than Ruth, Bonds was better than Aaron and Ohtani is better than Bonds, so Ohtani is the best baseball player ever. With that in mind, I didn’t rank him number one. I’m dumb or I’m the dumbest ever? 2025 Projections: 107/45/118/.294/20 in 576 ABs, 10-4/2.96/1.08/154 in 123 IP

3. Elly De La Cruz – I’m wild on E! and I hope E! is wild on the basepaths for one more year. When a player is as dynamic as E!, it does feel a little bit that at any point a team can pull on the reins and a 40/40 threat becomes a 30/20 player, but E!’s not there yet with those worries. Be gone, evil thoughts! 2025 Projections: 111/30/72/.267/51 in 602 ABs

4. Aaron Judge – Unlike not ranking Ohtani 1st overall, I don’t have as many questions about how dumb I am by ranking Aaron the Giant here vs. higher. A 7-foot tall guy just has too many moving parts to count on for 150 games every year, and he doesn’t have 50/50 upside. Though, I’d happily take a 50/10 year. 2025 Projections: 104/46/112/.307/10 in 509 ABs

5. Juan Soto – Gave you my Juan Soto fantasy. It was written while bobbing my head to Doechii’s newest album. (It’s excellent, and when I first wrote this in December it was less trite to say it.) 2025 Projections: 93/37/111/.288/11 in 564 ABs

6. Jose Ramirez – Might be the biggest “What does he need to do to get ranked in the top five overall?” and the answer is: Nothing. Lineup around him needs to get much better to even consider it. 2025 Projections: 103/36/111/.276/28 in 604 ABs

7. Gunnar Henderson – A big part of me wanted to rank Gunnar behind Ohtani, because I think Gunnar is actually the 2nd safest guy ranked, but 45/20, 30/50 and 45/10 with a chance for 60 homers beats him. Close though! Honestly, if I was setting which pick I wanted in a draft, the 5th pick doesn’t sound bad at all. This is a clear delineation point, but the top 20 is stacked with hitters. “It’s a good time to be alive,” says a guy with the very narrow focus of only caring about drafting a hitter in the top 20. UPDATE: Dealing with an intercostal strain, so he was dropped a few spots and lost two weeks of projections. 2025 Projections: 111/35/93/.289/17 in 569 ABs

8. Francisco Lindor – I might be misremembering this, but Lindor is the first appearance of a guy who hasn’t been ranked close to this high before, and is 31, which is a bit of a concern, but he’s averaging 30/30/.260 over the last two years, and is now getting Juan Soto behind him (in real baseball, where there’s slightly more crotch scratching), so I think if you’re fading Lindor, you’re just sorta guessing he won’t be good vs. actually having a reason. 2025 Projections: 112/32/93/.276/30 in 603 ABs

9. Kyle Tucker – Already gave you my Kyle Tucker fantasy. It was written while counting my Benjamins (DVDs of Benji movies). 2025 Projections: 106/36/97/.296/23 in 569 ABs

10. Fernando Tatis Jr. – I still fully believe, but if you take me out of the equation (which is sad, why don’t you want me?), Steamer has Fun The Jewels down for a 38/19/.280 season. I’d be giddy to get that giddy up. 2025 Projections: 93/34/96/.281/28 in 586 ABs

11. Corbin Carroll – Last year was a disaster for Carroll — OR WAS IT?! — I baited you, Mr. Reversal. DAMN, I KNEW IT. Carroll went 22/35 last year and had a .258 in the 2nd half. If he does 25/40/.260, is it that different than Elly? Not to answer but to ruminate. 2025 Projections: 117/28/75/.272/48 in 571 ABs

12. Julio Rodriguez – I could bait Mr. Reversal again with JRod asking if last year was really that bad, but let’s just say, can someone hypnotize JRod into thinking the entire 2025 season is September? 2025 Projections: 96/32/101/.272/33 in 605 ABs

13. Mookie Betts – Can’t project him for 155 games and 600+ at-bats, but if there’s one guy who could lead the league in runs and still break 100 RBIs, don’t doubt Mookie Best. 2025 Projections: 107/33/102/.294/17 in 579 ABs

14. Yordan Alvarez – Can’t stop imagining Captain Woo Cubano coming through with a 50-homer season, but every time I get those glorious visions, I fall back to earth by looking at his previous years and not seeing one year when he’s hit 40 HRs. He is safe top 25 guy with less upside than my brain keeps telling me he has. 2025 Projections: 91/36/102/.306/3 in 561 ABs

15. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. – What’s funny about fantasy but not haha-funny, is how similar Cake Batter and Captain Woo Cubano are for fantasy. Look at how similar their projections are. The not funny part is how if you were to see one guy bat after the other in an All-Star Game, you’d never think they were similar. Different sides of plate, one is more line drive, one is mammoth power, but they’re kinda samesies. 2025 Projections: 96/32/108/.309/4 in 605 ABs

16. Bryce Harper – Meh, you know Bryce. So, please enjoy:



2025 Projections: 89/33/96/.288/9 in 541 ABs

17. Paul Skenes – I’m not drafting him (or any starter this high), but it’s hard to ignore Skenes and what he can do, if that helps. It’s for the greater good not drafting Skenes, but, yes, I do love him and can understand the attraction for Livvy. 2025 Projections: 17-6/2.47/0.97/250 in 192 IP

18. Jarren Duran – This is the part of the top 20, Duran and Chourio, where I’m throwing out all my thoughts from Witt to Bryce which were, “Just be conservative and draft reasonably. Don’t push it. With ‘it’ being upside, which you know since these thoughts are in your own mind.” At this point, I cannot control my excitement. I want Duran and Chourio in every league and it’s partially because of upside and I don’t care. 2025 Projections: 116/23/74/.291/36 in 617 ABs

19. Jackson Chourio – Screaming at the top of my lungs, “Give me Chourio in every league exclamation mark after exclamation mark after exclamation mark!” 2025 Projections: 102/26/84/.284/32 in 589 ABs

20. Jazz Chisholm Jr. – Duran, Chourio and Jazz are 19A, 19B, there’s no 19C, then 19D. Also incredibly sold on going all-in on Jazz in Yankees uni for the whole season. Even if we only get 130 games from him, it’s better than 150 games from Jazz in Miami. Plus, he’s fun. You don’t like fun? Aw, who hurt you? 2025 Projections: 87/29/90/.248/31 in 531 ABs

21. Trea Turner – Treat Urner is not 19E. Treat Urner astounds by walking on his hind legs for four months, then plays dead for two months. 2025 Projections: 91/20/72/.287/22 in 541 ABs

22. Tarik Skubal – No, I am not (continued in next blurb). 2025 Projections: 17-5/2.51/0.94/237 in 202 IP

23. Zack Wheeler – Drafting a starter yet. More in the top 20 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball. Like 4500 words more. Sorry, if I don’t shorten the blurbs in this post, this will be 7,000 words long, which I say while adding more unnecessary words. 2025 Projections: 16-7/2.59/0.98/221 in 198 IP

24. Austin Riley – Here’s to the entire Braves’ lineup bouncing back, except for all the Braves who aren’t on any of my fantasy teams. Check back in two months to see who that is. Thank you. 2025 Projections: 93/35/96/.274/2 in 581 ABs

25. Ronald Acuña Jr. – UPDATE: Announced that he wouldn’t run as much, so I lowered him. 2025 Projections: 73/26/51/.269/24 in 441 ABs

26. Matt Olson – This area of the draft becomes the most problematic, from Treat Urner to ‘drafting 1st starter around pick 50.’ It’s landmine after landmine, at least it seems that way, and mostly because of the Braves hitters who are here. Players have bad seasons, there’s no reason Riley, Olson and Albies can’t bounce back. If you think players are only good coming off good seasons, can I remind you that Albies, Olson and Riley were coming off good seasons last year? 2025 Projections: 94/33/112/.254 in 606 ABs

27. Brent Rooker – As mentioned in the top 20 outfielders, Rooker might not have OF eligibility in your league. That knocks him off about two rounds, but that might have some variance depending on things like two utility spots, etc. 2025 Projections: 86/36/105/.268/10 in 539 ABs

28. Oneil Cruz – I might love Oneil Cruz more than the average person, but–Okay, that previous sentence is like assless chaps because there’s no buts. If I may assuage your feelings of hating me right now for how much I love Oneil Cruz, he can hit 40 homers and has easy 30-steal speed. If you draft hitters who have speed and power, you can only go so wrong. Look at Corbin Carroll, he was in the top 25 overall last year, and had one of the worst 1st halfs of all-time. 2025 Projections: 81/28/86/.257/20 in 556 ABs

29. Ozzie Albies – I’m begging you to just take a moment and think about how you would’ve loved to get Albies at this point in drafts last year. After he went 33/13 in 2023, you would’ve thought I hit my head if I only projected him for…2025 Projections: 91/27/82/.267/15 in 571 ABs

30. Manny Machado – I get the sense people don’t like Machado for… [waves hands vaguely around the room] …reasons. But he was coming off an injury last year and gave more value than this ranking, and he’s had a remarkable fantasy career. He’s going on a decade straight without disappointing. 2025 Projections: 71/31/108/.272/10 in 581 ABs

31. Ketel Marte – It’s gonna be interesting at the end of the year to see if Albies or Ketel are better in 2025, and what that means for 2026, because one was great in 2023, one was great in 2024, and this year is The Definer, as they say in the biz, and the biz is fantasy baseball rankings. Why are you laughing that I called fantasy baseball a business? Stop it. 2025 Projections: 91/25/80/.272/7 in 519 ABs

32. CJ Abrams – I bet CJ Abrams will return this value. To complete this transaction, use the DraftKings code, CJABRAMS-is-INNOCENT! 2025 Projections: 87/20/66/.244/34 in 557 AB

33. Corey Seager – It might not be what you expect, but, because of speed and power being such a valuable combo, Abrams is way safer to return value than Seager. I say it might not feel that way, because I think most people think Seager is a better real-world baseball player, and he might be, but we’re doing fantasy here. 2025 Projections: 76/31/82/.282/2 in 489 ABs

34. Jose Altuve – Fun fact! Before each game, Jose Altuve would repeat to himself into a mirror, ‘Shorty don’t stop, and I am Shorty,’ until the clubhouse attendant moved the mirror six inches higher on the wall. 2025 Projections: 91/22/62/.278/17 in 593 ABs

35. James Wood – Ya know how we are debating ourselves like we’re Debate Club alumni with how badly we don’t want to mess with the previous hitters, but will, because we have to? Ya know, the trepidation we had for Albies, Olson, et al. Well, that’s over for the next few picks. We very Kathleen-Turner-breathy want these guys. 2025 Projections: 89/26/77/.272/25 in 556 ABs

36. Wyatt Langford – I might be misremembering literally everything I know about the Rangers, but I’m counting on Wyatt to do more running and stealing this year. See, I measured Bruce Bochy’s head and the speed at which a thought moves through an average brain, and divided that by the Pitch Clock 12. Also, Wyatt’s insanely fast. 2025 Projections: 86/22/83/.267/26 in 553 ABs

37. Jackson Merrill – Wanna believe in Jackson Merrill more than the other two in this sexy trifecta of outfielders here, but the truth is I trust him the least, while still enough to happily draft him. Yes, it’s a very thin line to trust a guy a lot but, no, not that much. 2025 Projections: 88/27/86/.294/14 in 531 ABs

38. Brenton Doyle – Last year it was Nolan Jones, this year it’s Doyle. Every year we should have one Rockies hitter in the top 50 who will undoubtedly break our heart while Bud Black pees on our grave. It’s a good reminder life isn’t fair. 2025 Projections: 80/25/76/.252/32 in 578 ABs

39. Pete Alonso – Updated the 1st basemen rankings for Alonso, after he re-signed. (Also updated 3rd basemen rankings for Brett Baty. Bye-bye, Baty, as Dick Van Dyke would say.) 2025 Projections: 93/36/109/.247/3 in 591 ABs

40. Josh Naylor – So, I saw his early ADP was around 90 overall and I wasn’t sure if it was a Seymour Skinner situation where it was me seeing that and thinking, “It’s the kids who are wrong,” or if it was me putting on blinders and being way too high on Naylor, so I went back to the Player Rater from last year and this is almost exactly where he was last year in value, so the kids are wrong. 2025 Projections: 81/28/95/.261/7 in 559 ABs

41. Freddie Freeman – I get the feeling that this is the last time we see Freeman in the top 100 overall in the preseason, but, as mentioned in the 1st basemen rankings, the Dodgers’ lineup will fix a lot of issues with counting stats. 2025 Projections: 83/20/86/.277/10 in 536 ABs

42. Rafael Devers – Pretty concerned about Devers. Shoulders are tricky and his 2nd half was one of the worst. If being honest, I’m not sure I’d even draft him at this ranking. 2025 Projections: 95/27/89/.277/5 in 542 ABs

43. Logan Gilbert – There’s barely a first tier of starters to draft from, but I can see it if you’re thirsty, as I say in the top 20 starters, this is the point when the drafting of starters commences. More in next blurb. 2025 Projections: 13-12/2.89/0.96/217 in 204 IP

44. Dylan Cease – At any point here, you have to draft a starter. Like don’t have to have to have to draft Cease, but one of these starters. 2025 Projections: 15-7/3.39/1.09/233 in 193 IP

45. Cole Ragans – There will be a pitchers’ pairing tool out in the next few days to help you draft starters. It’s as easy as doing a clickety-click-clack. What are you doing?! Don’t clackety-click-click! I said clickety-click-clack! You ruined it! 2025 Projections: 14-8/3.36/1.13/226 in 188 IP

46. Framber Valdez – Have already drafted Framber as my number one starter in one league, and I look forward to being in on Framber for the first time in his career so he can wreck me and finally have a bad year. 2025 Projections: 14-9/3.39/1.12/191 in 194 IP

47. Emmanuel Clase – I can say I’m not drafting a closer and people will be like, “But if they’re there, would you?” Sure, if the draft is exactly like this ranking, which it will never be. CJ Abrams’s ADP is 48, Naylor is 95(!), James Wood is 51. More in next blurb. 2025 Projections: 3-1/2.07/0.91/64, 43 saves in 71 IP

48. Josh Hader – Wyatt Langford is 54, Oneil Cruz is 42; do you see what I’m saying? If you get to this spot in the draft, you know what you’re drafting? One of the fifteen guys I have ranked in front of their ADP and not a closer. It’s also why I say I’m unlikely to get Gilbert or Kirby. After you take an outfielder or corner man, you have to draft a starter, because you don’t have one yet. So, how are you drafting Hader? You might draft like this: Wyatt, Oneil, Wood, or a hitter around who I have ranked higher than their ADP, then Cease, Ragans or any other starter, then Josh Naylor at pick 70, if he’s really going at 95 overall, so now you’re at pick 85, you’re really drafting one of these closers? Please stop being daft. 2025 Projections: 5-2/2.38/0.98/102, 36 saves in 70 IP

49. Devin Williams – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Yankees acquired him, and my Malcolm Gladwell-Blink thoughts on it was this is the best trade the Yankees have done in a decade. If they would’ve retained Juan Soto, I might think that deal was worth Michael King, but I can no longer say that. Let me clarify, I love top-notch closers from a real baseball standpoint. No team is winning anything without a lights-out guy pitching the 9th. Guys can step up and be The Guy who don’t have the track record, or just get hot in October, like the Dodgers with Treinen this past postseason. But someone needs to be locking down the final three outs, and no one is better than Devin Williams. For fantasy? Yeah, SAGNOF and eff that. He looks like prime Mo on paper, though. My God, his stats are ridonk.

14.2 K/9, 1.93 ERA — 2022
13.4 K/9, 1.53 ERA — 2023
15.8 K/9, 1.25 ERA — 2024

And who can forget 2021 where he ended the year by punching the wall! Or missed last year’s 1st half with back surgery. Okay, so he has some red flags, but who doesn’t? Edwin Diaz ends every game with a limp-wristed handshake because he’s scared if he celebrates too much he will re-injure himself. Again, I’m not drafting Devin Williams, just laying out to you the good and bad. The good outweighs the bad by a lot. His pitching is truly must-see TV, assuming he hasn’t punched the TV already.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 3-0/1.66/0.95/89, 41 saves in 60 IP

50. Willy Adames – Already gave you my Willy Adames fantasy. It was written all over your face! 2025 Projections: 81/27/92/.238/12 in 581 ABs

51. Cody Bellinger – Already gave you my Cody Bellinger fantasy. It had some real sass! 2025 Projections: 104/26/81/.267/12 in 522 ABs

52. Blake Snell – If you click that Willy Adames fantasy link, it also has my Blake Snell fantasy. 2025 Projections: 11-5/3.34/1.11/166 in 124 IP

53. Michael King – Thought about how his ranking could mean King was my first starter on a team, and then I saw how he was the 16th best starter last year, and, yes, I will take him as my 1st starter. King stay King. 2025 Projections: 12-8/3.38/1.16/207 in 181 IP

54. Garrett Crochet – Already gave you my Garrett Crochet fantasy. It was written while being locked up by Barney Fife. 2025 Projections: 13-9/3.47/1.05/193 in 154 IP

55. Shota Imanaga – I like Yoshinobu, but he’s going twenty spots before Shota in early ADP. Even if you think they’ll both be completely healthy in 2025, which I do, Shota just threw 170-plus innings of a sub-3 ERA with a 9+ K/9, which has to put him ahead. 2025 Projections: 13-6/3.17/1.05/177 in 175 IP

56. Bryce Miller – Pray for my fantasy teams that will be in last place in wins, because I drafted four M’s starters. 2025 Projections: 11-10/3.26/1.01/171 in 184 IP

57. Teoscar Hernandez – About as set-him-and-forget-him of a guy for your fantasy lineup as Ron ever Popeil’d. 21st on the Player Rater last year, and I can’t imagine him being much worse this year. Like I’m a crypto guy on Youtube screaming, “Pure profit!” 2025 Projections: 81/34/94/.261/7 in 576 ABs

58. Lawrence Butler – His name is so interesting to me. Just slight variations and his career path changes. Larry Butler plays in the NBA, Law’rence Butler runs for 150 yards in the NFL, and Lawrence Butler plays baseball. I don’t know why that is true, but it is. Also, it’s true that I want to draft Butler in every league. 2025 Projections: 84/27/67/.269/23 in 581 ABs

59. Spencer Steer – When I see Steer being drafted around 120 overall, I realize that a lot of people who pretend to understand fantasy don’t. A 27-year-old, 20/20 guy with a .250 neutral average isn’t a 120 overall pick. Though, if you can wait a few rounds to draft Steer, go for it. For what it’s Cronenworth, our Steamer auction values have him around 100 overall, so appizzarently I am the idiot here. UPDATE: Shoulder issues, see the top 500 for new ranking and projection. 2025 Projections: 71/22/82/.259/26 in 566 ABs

60. Seiya Suzuki – Not to take anything away from Lawrence Butler (not Larry or Law’rence), but(ler) he just went 22/18 in 412 ABs in his 1st major league season; Steer went 23/15 in 2023 and 20/25 in 2024, and Suzuki went 20/6 and 21/16 in the last two years, so I’m fine with how I ranked them, but that Butler’s ADP is 65, Seiya is 85 and Steer is 120 makes no sense. This is me still hung up on Steer being underrated. 2025 Projections: 75/23/81/.281/15 in 519 ABs

61. Christian Walker – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Astros. First, Jon Singleton is suspended for hotboxing the batter’s box and now he’s bumped to the bench for a Christian. Y’all and your Puritanical values. Let my man smoke balls and joints! Balls ‘n Joints is also the name of my very bad mechanic. “Looks like you have a…” Long pull off a joint. “…car problem.” So, Christian Walker’s batted ball profile looks better last year vs. the year before (when he was on the surface better), and I trust the Astros as much as any team. Until the Astros make a terrible signing that doesn’t work out, I’m on board. Being for real: You gotta trust something in this lil’ snow globe we call the world. Look at Walker’s HardHit% and only that from 2023 to 2024: 40.4% to 48%. Yeah, last year wasn’t a bad year, and I currently see him being drafted at a nice discount.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 83/34/95/.254/3 in 579 ABs

62. Riley Greene – What’s kinda funny about rankings that isn’t funny, you (me) justify your Butler ranking by saying he’s a top 60-ish guy, then you justify Steer because he’s pretty much the same, then you justify your Seiya ranking with 23/15/.281 projections, then you see Riley Greene with essentially the same projections but seven years younger so more upside and you end up ranking Riley forty spots in front of his ADP. Welcome to my mind! 2025 Projections: 74/27/86/.274/7 in 527 ABs

63. Yoshinobu Yamamoto – I love Yamamoto, and a lot people do, just a hair bit more than me, so I might not roster him anywhere. But I’m open to being surprised! 2025 Projections: 11-5/3.19/1.09/159 in 139 IP

64. Spencer Schwellenbach – Here’s an interesting ADP tidbit. Schwellenbach is being drafted 40 spots after Yoshinobu, but was about 60 spots ahead of him on the Player Rater last year, and should be good for at least 30 more innings, so, well: Interesting. 2025 Projections: 13-7/3.26/1.03/183 in 176 IP

65. Roki Sasaki – Gave you my Roki Sasaki fantasy when he signed. It was written while staring into The Abyss, the movie. 2025 Projections: 12-6/2.92/1.06/181 in 136 IP

66. Anthony Santander – Basically, Teoscar without the same name value. Call him Hydrox Teoscar. 2025 Projections: 84/36/97/.244/3 in 588 ABs

67. Jacob deGrom – …and we’re not drafting starters anymore! I mean, we are, just not this schmohawk. 2025 Projections: 5-3/2.41/0.91/124 in 89 IP

68. Chris Sale – Not this one either. 2025 Projections: 12-6/3.03/1.06/152 in 123 IP

69. Corbin Burnes – Already gave you my Corbin Burnes fantasy. I wrote it while saying, “I’m not drafting him either.” 2025 Projections: 15-8/3.41/1.12/186 in 195 IP

70. Gerrit Cole – Or this one. UPDATE: Needs Tommy John surgery, don’t draft. 2025 Projections: 13-10/3.66/1.17/152 in 148 IP

71. George Kirby – I’m either drafting an outfielder, outfielder, outfielder, Josh Naylor, CJ Abrams, or outfielder in this general area of the draft, but, in theory I would draft Gilbert or Kirby. I’m just being realistic. That’s why when I say stuff like, “I’m not drafting a starter until pick 45-ish but am drafting Gilbert or Kirby,” it’s kind of not true. It’s prolly the one thing that trips so many people up in my rankings, no matter how many times I explain it. More in next blurb. UPDATE: Shoulder inflammation 2025 Projections: 10-8/3.29/1.03/142 in 154 IP

72. Pablo Lopez – Or…you get the idea, right? I talk more about all these guys in the top 40 starters. 2025 Projections: 13-9/3.77/1.17/203 in 188 IP

73. Edwin Diaz – Okay, need to say again something to alleviate your fears when you’re thinking, “If I’m not drafting starters from deGrom through these closers then what the heck am I drafting?” So, once again I am pointing out that I am so much higher on Schwellenbach, Santander, Riley Greene, Walker, just about everyone above this string of pitchers I’m avoiding, so there’s literally no way you get here and you’re between deGrom, et al, and the closers. 2025 Projections: 4-1/2.61/1.02/89, 30 saves in 60 IP

74. Ryan Helsley – Same story, 2nd verse. 2025 Projections: 6-2/2.91/1.08/74, 31 saves in 62 IP

75. Felix Bautista – So, yes, third verse. Also, Bautista is returning from Tommy John surgery, which normally worries me, but A) He’s a closer, so he only needs to throw, what? 20 pitches a game? B) I’m not drafting him anyway. C) There’s no C. 2025 Projections: 3-1/2.89/1.03/91, 27 saves in 58 IP

76. Bryan Reynolds – As the world’s oldest and most ardent supporter of Bryan Reynolds, I just want to say don’t draft him, so there’s more shares for me of the most consistently solid fantasy outfielder who I’ve always loved. 2025 Projections: 84/25/87/.272/10 in 591 ABs

77. Kyle Schwarber – Speaking of old and ardent supporters of a player, I basically invented loving The Schwarbomb. What’s that? What about my post last year about Schwarber being overrated? A ruse for me to get more shares! 2025 Projections: 106/40/105/.231/3 in 581 ABs


freestar
78. Marcell Ozuna – Okay, sarcasm aside, we are squarely in the section of the draft where, “I am holding my nose and drafting, but, in reality, I shouldn’t be thinking these guys are stinkers because these guys have been good for a while.” Take Ozuna (not to a bar and then to his car, though), a guy who has back-to-back of 40 and 39 homers and just hit .302. There’s no reason to hold your nose here. 2025 Projections: 86/38/107/.278/1 in 582 ABs

79. Ian Happ – Pretty much perfectly ranked here with Reynolds, Schwarber and Ozuna. Do you love drafting Happ? Prolly not. Should you because he’s been valuable repeatedly? Yes. 2025 Projections: 86/24/69/.247/12 in 571 ABs

80. Mark Vientos – Already gave you my Mark Vientos sleeper. It was written while running a red light.  2025 Projections: 82/34/95/.251/1 in 580 ABs

81. Marcus Semien – Just had a terrible thought, what if Semien, who has 650+ ABs for the last four years, only gets 550 ABs. Semien making me shudder like I’m staying in a Motel Six and thinking about what’s on the bedsheets. 2025 Projections: 92/20/67/.233/10 in 604 ABs

82. Bailey Ober – As mentioned previously, I wait a little while longer than most to draft my 1st starter, but usually draft my 2nd starter a little quicker. Roger that, Ober and out. 2025 Projections: 13-8/3.69/1.09/184 in 176 IP

83. William Contreras – El oh el. It’s such a crock that I even rank one catcher in the top 100, because I’d never draft one and I only rank this one 50 spots after his ADP to make sure no one gets confused as to whether I am drafting him or not. I am not. 2025 Projections: 86/20/74/.286/7 in 559 ABs

84. Jordan Westburg – And just like that the 2nd basemen become interesting. See the 2nd basemen rankings for more of that quick turnaround from the Mehs to the Nomnomnoms. 2025 Projections: 74/22/82/.273/12 in 527 ABs

85. Junior Caminero – The past few seasons it’s felt like there’s been some huge risk/reward guys in the top 100. Wyatt Langford and Royce Lewis come to mind last year and both kinda meh’d it up, but Langford less so. This year feels less risky for big upside gambles in the top 100, which is good. You don’t want risk early. I bring this up now, because Caminero might be the biggest Amazon Wish List vs. safe and reliable. 2025 Projections: 82/28/88/.264/7 in 572 ABs

86. Logan Webb – Currently thinking about my claim to fame that no one knows about with Lifetime ADP. Logan Webb, you and I are going to be so rich when we take this theory public. Uh, more public. Uh, I’m gonna be rich, Webb already is. Lifetime ADP: Better than the self-driving car. Don’t know what Lifetime ADP is? Because I’ve only mentioned it 25 times before and I need it to get to 10,000 before it clicks. To read more about it, see Webb’s blurb in the top 40 starters. 2025 Projections: 13-10/3.48/1.12/176 in 202 IP

87. Zac Gallen – It’s absurd that Zac Gallen is going this low, when he’s essentially a number one. If you draft, say, Framber and Gallen as your 1st two starters, you can’t lose! That’s my no money back guarantee! 2025 Projections: 15-7/3.59/1.16/193 in 187 IP

88. Alex Bregman – After signing with the Red Sox, updated in the 3rd basemen rankings. 2025 Projections: 92/25/81/.282/5 in 571 ABs

89. Bryan Woo – ‘Drafting Woo’ sounds like me if I were Tom Cruise in Days of Thunder explaining drafting. [moves sugar packet down thigh] Woo! 2025 Projections: 10-8/3.33/0.97/136 in 154 IP


freestar
90. Grayson Rodriguez – Still think that at some point Grayson is going to click into place and become a top five starter for a half decade. Might be this year. UPDATE: Triceps soreness, do not draft 2025 Projections: 15-7/3.51/1.14/189 in 167 IP

91. Sonny Gray – I’m not recommending it, but if you drafted Gallen, Grayson and Sonny Gray and zero other starters, then just streamed, you’d prolly be fine. 2025 Projections: 12-10/3.56/1.13/186 in 164 IP

92. Tanner Bibee – Already gave you my Tanner Bibee sleeper. I wrote it while yelling, “Bring it on!” while watching Bring It On. 2025 Projections: 14-7/3.30/1.10/191 in 180 IP

93. Triston Casas – Moved Casas around a lot like I was an itinerant. Finally landed him here because I think this is realistic for where I would draft him, based on his injury risk. Hopefully he stays healthy and leaves me perfectly happy with the amount I moved Casas, i.e., nomad. (I’m so sorry for that pun; it was avoidable and I just couldn’t.) 2025 Projections: 87/30/91/.251 in 546 ABs

94. Hunter Brown – Came so close to writing a Hunter Brown sleeper in October (when I write my sleeper posts) that when I was posting the pitcher sleepers in January, I was looking for my Hunter Brown sleeper because I thought I did write it. I did not, but I do love him. 2025 Projections: 13-9/3.55/1.24/184 in 172 IP

95. Jack Flaherty – Re-signed with the Tigers, or maybe that’s resigned to re-sign because it was February and no teams wanted a legit ace make it make sense. For those of you who are like, “Yeah, but maybe he’s hurt, so I can understand why he wasn’t signed for a while.” Cool, Scherzer received $15.5 millies and is ancient and hasn’t been healthy in years. 2025 Projections: 12-6/3.02/1.05/161 in 144 IP

96. Robert Suarez – Mentioning this for the 1st time maybe ever, so listen up real good: I am handsome in an offbeat way. Okay, also mentioning: There were nine relievers in the top 100 last year, so around nine is what I tried to rank this year. “Around nine” is 10, nine or eight. It’s also how I come to rank a certain amount per position in the top 100. (And top 200 and top 300 and so on.) More in the next blurb. 2025 Projections: 5-3/2.95/1.04/61, 31 saves in 66 IP

97. Ryan Walker – I go to the Player Rater from the previous year and check how many guys from each position are in the top 100 (and so on) and try to match it. If there were five 2nd basemen (and there were) in the top 100 last year, there needs to be a strong reason to include more or less than five in this top 100. Also, if there’s seven 2nd basemen this year (there is), then I need to remove a guy or two from elsewhere. More in next blurb. 2025 Projections: 5-2/2.89/0.98/82, 28 saves in 67 IP

98. Mason Miller – Shortstops lost two, Jeremy Pena (meh, boring) and Neto (injury) fell out, catchers lost five because I refuse to rank five more catchers in the top 100, starters gained three, and yadda-blabbity-bloo. You get the gist, and now you know why there’s nine closers in the top 100. 2025 Projections: 3-1/2.32/0.94/93, 21 saves in 62 IP

99. Freddy Peralta – FreddyKBB can’t be bad because every time I’ve rostered him he’s been great! (I believe I was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’d about every year I rostered FreddyKBB, but I can’t be sure.) 2025 Projections: 12-9/3.61/1.15/207 in 177 IP

100. Ezequiel Tovar – Thought to myself ranking Tovar here was such an adult move because he’s likely worth this ranking, even if he’s not that exciting, so to double check I went to look at our Preseason Player Rater to see where Steamer has Tovar ranked and it was exactly at 100 (might’ve changed by time you read this because of injuries, signings, etc.). Anyway, that means I am now an adult. I’m a big boy! 2025 Projections: 92/24/71/.274/10 in 612 ABs

101. Anthony Volpe – Ya know what would be a fun game? Guessing whether I have a player higher or lower than Steamer’s Preseason Ranking. What do you guess with Volpe? I’m higher or lower than them? I was surprised, if that helps. 2025 Projections: 87/20/62/.252/26 in 587 ABs
