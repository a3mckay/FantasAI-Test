As they say in conductor school, “Hey, Maestro, let’s keep this train going!” “Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’, is what we doing,” as they say in Snoop Dogg’s hooptie. Here’s the top 60 outfielders, which I bet you could’ve guessed from the title, unless you’re in that hooptie. The 2025 fantasy baseball rankings are there. Subscriptions are up and running — thanks, Rudy! — and you can already get Rudy’s Draft War Room. Anyway, here’s the top 60 outfielders for 2025 fantasy baseball:

CONTINUE BACK TO THE TOP 40 OUTFIELDERS FOR 2025 FANTASY BASEBALL

41. Steven Kwan – This tier started in the top 40 outfielders. This tier ends at McCarthy. I called this tier, “Yo, who da eff is you.” Is Kwan good? Yes. Is he great? Well, how badly do you need average? Last year, he was roughly about this valuable, and missed a good month. My big problem with him is he doesn’t have any power and seems to refuse to use his speed for steals. If he could go 10/25/.300, then he has real value if it’s in 150 games with 100+ runs. Weird thing is it seems less about ability and more about want. Hard to hate that, hard for me to love it either. 2025 Projections: 91/11/51/.291/16 in 572 ABs

42. Josh Lowe – If Lane Thomas was the King of Yo, Who Da Eff Is You, Lowe might be the Queen. There’s certain players who, if other ‘perts are too confident about them, they send up red flags for me. Josh Lowe is one this preseason. If you’re reading someone else who is 100% certain who J.Lo is, and are not talking about being from the block with the rocks they got in their head, then they’re BS’ing you and you shouldn’t trust anything they say. Could Lowe be great? Sure. Could he be awful? Absolutely. Could he hit 20+ homers? Yup. 10? You got it. Steal 30 bags? Yup. Steal 15? You’re following now. Play in 70, 100, 125 or 50 games? Yes, yes, yes and why not. His strikeout rate even went from 24.8% to 31.8% year over year. Like what even? 2025 Projections: 51/14/53/.251/22 in 414 ABs

43. Brandon Nimmo – The year was 2024 when Brandon Nimmo decided to illustrate the Pitch Clock 12 as described by Grey Albright, Fantasy Master Lothario (don’t abbreviate), when Nimmo showed his three-steal usual output year-after-year-after-year could easily become 15 steals if he just wanted to run. The statline: 88/23/90/.224/15 last year is a “Yo, who da eff is you” because Nimmo was about as predictable for a .270 season with three steals that you could set your watch by it, until it wasn’t last year. Now to confuse matters more, he was suffering from plantar fasciitis and says he still has it. So, what are we getting this year? I.e., who knows where we’re gonna find Nimmo. 2025 Projections: 83/24/80/.241/10 in 557 ABs

44. Nick Castellanos – The Greek God of Hard Contact is a “Yo, who da eff is you” because he’s on the verge of becoming old, possibly. Whether or not he is, that’s the debatable part and why I’m “Yo, who da eff” with him. His last year might’ve been a blip as he regains sparks of Hard Contact, but right now he looks like he’s on that undeniable path to oblivion that older players take, when their fly balls go up, Hard Contact goes down, BABIP goes down and they slowly become 25-homer, .250 hitters with a bunch of 370-foot fly outs. Think any older slugger like Arenado. 2025 Projections: 76/25/83/.248/5 in 591 ABs

45. Jake McCarthy – Picturing someone explaining this tier to a non-reader, “Yeah, see, Grey ranked these guys higher because he has no freakin’ clue who they are.” So, that is accurate-ish, but I put that ish on that shizz because it’s not 100% correct. McCarthy, for unstints, was just a top 35 outfielder last year, and that’s the 2nd solid year in three from him. The middle year is why there’s some question marks on his leotards, Riddler-like. He appears to be a middle-of-the-order 8/25/.280 hitter, which is solid, as long as he doesn’t repeat 2023. This tier is me being real with you. I do not know on these guys, but, more so, if anyone purports to know, you should question them. 2025 Projections: 67/10/63/.281/27 in 493 ABs

46. Michael Toglia – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Nootbaar. I call this tier, “The good stuff in your hand.” Imagine you said to someone you liked the creme filling of an Oreo and they were like, “Awesome, I am a weird person and don’t like it, so I will give you mine. Hold out your hand…” Then they proceed to put their creme filling in your hand. Cool, that is the good stuff, but it’s also a little gross they just scraped a creme filling into your hand. That’s this tier. These guys are the good stuff, but they have some gross elements that are impossible to ignore.

As for Toglia, already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

47. Tyler O’Neill – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Orioles. The O’s spend seven years building up a farm system they never give an opportunity. Heston Kjerstad, get ready to learn Miami, buddy, because you’re gonna be traded for a pitcher in July. Too bad, Heston Kjerstad was my favorite player who sounded like an Ikea couch. Though, I guess O’Neill might get hurt in March and Kjerstad is bjerstack! So, not sure if you’ve heard but two teams became jealous of the A’s finding a new stadium and the Rays and O’s are also playing in new-ish parks. Rays are headed to Big Stein Stadium, where the PA announcer sounds a lot like Larry David; A’s are headed to a minor league park, SacPark, and O’s just brought in their fences to pre-moving-their-fences-out distance. Rays’ lefties get a boost, but Rays’ lefties get benched by Cash half the time; A’s hitters will get a boost in BABIP with less foul territory, and the O’s righties are back, baby, according to BBC’s number detective, Mountcastle. O’Neill could likely hit it out of any stadium, but the new fences won’t hurt and you know I love him, as long as he’s actually playing, which he does about 120 times a year.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 77/33/83/.236/6 in 464 ABs

48. Taylor Ward – Saw Taylor Ward’s previous season line of 25/6/.246 and saw him projected as the Angels’ leadoff man and thought about how I’d like to bum one of Ron Washington’s magical-thinking cigarettes. Wonder if he calls Ward “Winston” and tells him which bat to use by calling it an “unfiltered 120.” Not saying the Angels are chock-full of leadoff men, but, yeah, Ward ain’t a leadoff man. Also, kinda sucks that he’s already 31 years old, and this is a helluva way to start a blurb in a positive tier. Listen, if these guys were 100% positive, they’d be ranked 20 or more spots higher. Ward nearly got a sleeper post from me because his Statcast page is as pretty as any, and he has an outside chance at a 30/10/.260 season, which is top ten outfielder stuff. The good stuff in your hand. 2025 Projections: 83/27/76/.253/7 in 561 ABs

49. Victor Robles – Already gave you my Victor Robles sleeper. It was written while starting a jam band. 2025 Projections: 76/8/47/.287/34 in 471 ABs

50. Spencer Steer – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

51. Willi Castro – Already went over him in the top 20 2nd basemen for fantasy baseball.

52. Kerry Carpenter – First, a Reddit image:



So, Kerry Carpenter is the good stuff in your hand, except he literally can’t hit lefties. As mentioned before, if a guy can’t hit lefties, you don’t want him facing lefties. If he can hit righties, as he did last year, then that’s plenty of wonderful. You just have to work around him, which is admittedly easier in daily leagues. If you’re in a weekly league, shave a couple dollars off his auction value or a round off his draft spot, if you like, but his projections are fairly comparable to Nimmo and Castellanos with upside. 2025 Projections: 62/24/74/.279/4 in 449 ABs

53. Lars Nootbaar – Already gave you my Lars Nootbaar sleeper. It was written while singing in the shower. 2025 Projections: 72/23/75/.266/10 in 486 ABs

54. Cedric Mullins – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Profar. I call this tier, “Bored-a-rino.” This is not a glamorous, capital FUN tier. This tier may find you bored-a-rino, which is a fun way of saying bored, and that’s the only fun you’re having in this tier. But — again with some stank — BUT! sometimes boring is what’s called for with your fantasy team.

As for Cedric the HRtainer, ya know what’s funny-not-funny? Orioles, Rays and A’s all will be in new stadiums in 2025, and trying to keep them all straight in my head, and who will be benefitting has my brain all twisted up like a Wetzel. We need a mnemonic. How about, “ROY G BIV…ROY G BIV…SOY G BIF.”

Rays’ Outfield Go Big If Vefty

So, they need work. Are they haikus? Any hoo! Cedric is a lefty, who only is being affected if he goes the other way, so it’s basically irrelevant for him. That’s okay, he’s a 30-ish steal guy, which has its place if you need that. 2025 Projections: 61/15/63/.231/28 in 434 ABs

55. Jorge Soler – Here’s what I said when he was traded, “Traded to the Angels. Jorge Soler can’t play outfield and the Angels need to play Mike Trout at DH, so, yeah, the Angels wasted no time becoming a laughingstock for the new 2025 season. [takes a long sniff] “You smell that? It’s an Angels’ terrible move!” A Good Moves hand reaches out to shake the Angels’ hand and it has a buzzer in their hand so the mouth attached to the Good Moves hand screams, “Ow! Make it stop! I’m sorry, I won’t try to make any Good Moves anymore with the Angels!” This moves Trout to the outfield, pushes Moniak to the bench, a guy who should be getting ABs, and just clogs the middle of their order. Thanks, I hate it.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 71/27/74/.234/2 in 481 ABs

56. Luke Raley – Already went over him in the top 20 1st basemen for 2025 fantasy baseball.

57. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. – Epitome of bored-a-rino. I actually like Lou-Gu-Ju a lot in certain circumstances, but those circumstances are never “Aw sookie, I’m doing it all for the nookie, give me a cookie, this is so much fun to draft Lou-Gu-Ju!” If you get an erection for longer than five minutes after drafting Gurriel, see a doctor immediately. 2025 Projections: 71/20/78/.271/5 in 547 ABs

58. Wilyer Abreu – So, this one is a little weird for a quote-unquote boring tier. Is Wilyer Abreu boring? Not on first glance. He was a rookie last year, and was a top 60 outfielder. That should mean he has nothing but upside. Alas, I think all his upside is undercut by his downside. Red Sox have a ton of bats, and he hit .180 vs. lefties, so it feels like that’s the end of his chances vs. lefties. He just went 15/8/.253 in 399 ABs. If he gets 450 ABs, how much upside does he have realistically? He has great defense, so it might keep him in the lineup when he shouldn’t be there, but we need to see a lot more power, speed or less Ks. Right now, he feels like young Yoshida. Call him Youngshida. (Lol, that is so weak, while making me laugh.) 2025 Projections: 53/17/60/.255/10 in 419 ABs

59. Byron Buxton – Little insight into how guys get ranked where they are. I list 120-ish outfielders, then move them around. Most guys get moved once, i.e., if Jesus Sanchez has upside, but question marks and similar projections to Wilyer Abreu, he gets ranked by him. For Buxton, I moved him about six times. As high as the “Who da eff” tier in the top 60 outfielders, then into the Bored-a-rino tier then below, then up again, then, well, you get the picture. Still not sure if I’m happy with this ranking, but when you take away the names, this is, more or less, the 20/10/.250 tier with question marks. 2025 Projections: 66/20/63/.253/8 in 414 ABs

60. Jurickson Profar – Signed with the Braves. Considered Jurickson Profar someone who wouldn’t live up to last year, but now that the Braves signed him he’ll be top three for MVP. I’m half-joking. Just not sure which half is the joke and which half is the truth. Damn, that sounds like a life motto. “Life can be broken into two halves. Half is the joke and half is the truth, but no one knows which is which,” a famous quote from Grey Albright, Fantasy Master Lothario, don’t abbreviate it. A career high in homers, steals and average in his last major contract year? Yeah, I think that’s the joke half. 2025 Projections: 63/17/60/.263/7 in 441 ABs
