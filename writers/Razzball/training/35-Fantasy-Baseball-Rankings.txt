Looking at the overall 2025 fantasy baseball rankings, the top 80 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball is from around 200 overall to 275 overall, which is just about the end for 12-team mixed leagues. This is your fifth thru the beginning of the sixth starters. This is just about it for 12 team leagues, though the last tier in this post is still in 12-team league territory, so you’ll have to wait until the next post to finish off that tier. Don’t worry, on that next post, I’ll be by with another 50-ish pitchers for those in deeper leagues, and/or dynasty and keeper leagues.

Our subscriptions are up and running, and that comes with our online Fantasy Baseball War Room — now for auction drafts, AL-Only, NL-Only, Best Ball and more. Here’s Steamer’s 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Hitters and 2025 Fantasy Baseball Projections for Pitchers. All projections included here are mine, and where I see tiers starting and stopping are included. Anyway, here’s the top 80 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball:

NOTE I: All my rankings are currently available on Patreon for the price of a Starbucks coffee, if you get one of those extra grande frappuccino jobbers. Don’t wait for the rankings to come out over the next month, and get them all now.

NOTE II: Free agents are listed as just that and not yet projected. Once a guy signs, I will write out their blurb and add in projections, or remove them, if they sign in an unfavorable place. They are ranked currently where I think they might be if they sign on for a full-time job.

NOTE III: Watch Bdon and I discuss the starter rankings:



RETURN TO THE TOP 60 STARTERS FOR 2025 FANTASY BASEBALL

61. Yusei Kikuchi – This tier started in the top 60 starters. This tier ends here. I called this tier, “Broke and getting brokener or unbrokener but not on my teams.” As for Kikuchi, here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Angels. Astros coach-up their pitchers; Angels coach-down theirs, but Yusei also is a vet who you’d think could ignore the Angels’ reverse devil magic. Either way, Yusei Kikuchi will be an interesting case study. Can he stay good, like on the Astros, or will he revert? For a reminder, he has a 4.57 ERA in his 809 2/3 career innings. That’s not good. He had literally one decent full season. You trusting that to ignore the Angels? You’re braver than me.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 9-10/4.13/1.22/186 in 167 IP

62. Ronel Blanco – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Manaea. I call this tier, “Broken emergency anchor glass.” This tier is usually filled with safe number five starters who you can get cheap and they anchor your staff. In the past, this was a condom tier. Something that could glue the team together. A Dollar Store condom, so there was some risk, but the wrapper says it’s safe. Not this year. No one is safe. These guys are the closest guys I can find to anchor your staff, but the emergency glass is broken and the anchor is hanging out on the floor. You can see I’m very familiar with ships, thinking anchors are behind emergency glass. Usually this tier is cheap, older guys, but this year is a super random collection of risky starters that feel more “break in case of emergency” than usual.

As for Blanco, so. Dot dot dot. His numbers don’t make total sense. He had a 2.80 ERA and 8.9 K/9, 3.66 BB/9 in 167 1/3 IP. Okay, zero sense. Throw in a 39.8 GB%, .220 BABIP and–Well, I have two thoughts on him. He will repeat his value because the Astros work magic with their starters. Or he will fall back to earth. I will risk it this late on the Astros having something else up their sleeve besides a drumstick for their trash can. 2025 Projections: 11-9/3.77/1.31/170 in 171 IP

63. Jesus Luzardo – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Traded to the Phils for dynamic, but very young prospects. Not bad for a pitcher who was a top 20 starter two years ago, and seemed headed for an even better year in 2024, until injuries derailed him. In fact! (Grey’s got more.) After two straight years of promising results, Luzardo had a season last year that was perhaps the worst thing God ever spit up. From flexor muscle strain to lumbar stress reaction to, the worst of all, still having to pitch for the Marlins all season and not being traded. He was shut down in early August and I really don’t know what to expect here. He could be totally healed, and I trust the Phils to know that, so I actually moved him up in my rankings after this trade. I think at his draft price, it’s worth the flyer to see if you get a bounce back, and what better place for a flyer than Philly.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 11-8/3.76/1.26/154 in 148 IP

64. MacKenzie Gore – If I didn’t write a sleeper post for Gore last year, I might’ve wrote one for him this year. He is so close to figuring it out. Sooooooo close, even. He just needs to cut a half walk to a full walk off his walk rate and he could be a solid number two. He’s also entering the season when starters supposedly break out, though I think that might be overstated. Either way, he is coming off his best season, and only 26. You might get a 9-12/4.45/1.35 starter or you might get…2025 Projections: 10-9/3.78/1.29/178 in 164 IP

65. Reese Olson – We make fun of the Tigers for developing ‘power’ bats that turn out to be “18-22 HRs, .240 hitters” or for signing Javier Baez for 17 years, but they deserve some props for developing pitchers well. Doesn’t hurt that their stadium is goofy bad for hitters, and the temperatures likely don’t hurt in April/May and September. All that noted, but Olson is latest pitcher they’ve developed who has solid-ish stuff that they’ve pitched up. Well done, Tigers pitching coaches, is there nothing you can’t do? (Don’t look at Casey Mize.) 2025 Projections: 8-9/3.71/1.22/147 in 159 IP

66. Tanner Houck – Another way to think about this tier could’ve been “Solid last year but looking at their peripherals and imitating a dog by woof woof woofing.” I’m all for ignoring some peripherals and giving a guy’s ERA the benefit of the doubt, but Houck did get a tad lucky last year. That’s okay though, he doesn’t need to repeat his 3.12 ERA from last year. A 3.65-ish ERA would do the trick. He also cut his walk rate by more than a full walk per nine and had a 55.9% ground ball rate, that’s pretty perfect, and a good way to avoid being BABIP’ed by the Green Monster. Plus, he had better K-rates in years past. Anything would be better than his 7.8 K/9 from last year. 2025 Projections: 11-10/3.68/1.16/167 in 177 IP

67. Michael Wacha – 3.32, 3.22, 3.35. 1.12, 1.16, 1.19. 11, 14, 13. Those are the last three years of ERA, WHIPs and Wins, respectively. Last time I checked that was three of the four categories you were trying for in the majority of fantasy leagues when it comes to starters. Last year, he was the 34th best starter on the Player Rater. If you’re getting him here, you’re crazy to not take him. 2025 Projections: 11-9/3.58/1.17/134 in 154 IP

68. Jose Berrios – He has a 3.65 ERA and a 3.60 ERA year over year after demolishing my hopes and dreams in 2022, and I have to learn to forget that but I can’t so leave me the freak alone! Berrios lost a lot of strikeouts last year, but maintained his command and velocity while throwing almost 200 IP, so, yeah, he feels about as safe and boring as they come while having a chance at a dirty, nasty 5+ ERA season. 2025 Projections: 13-9/3.77/1.21/162 in 190 IP

69. Sean Manaea – Re-signed with the Mets, which is an excellent place for him and them. “And them! And them!” That’s a person misremembering Dude, Where’s My Car. Manaea neutrally looks like a 4.00 ERA, 9+ K/9, 1.20 WHIP guy, chance for wins, and 180 IP, which sounds like a perfect number four. Hope he continues to induce weak fly balls to the deep part of Metco and hovers things at a 3.80 ERA with solid peripherals and innings. UPDATE: Oblique strain and might not throw for a month, then he has to ramp up and, before you know it, it’s 2047 and we’re all living on Mars growing potatoes. Or he’s back around May 1st. His projections have been updated. 2025 Projections: 10-7/3.82/1.23/136 in 131 IP

70. Jackson Jobe – This is a new tier.  This tier goes from here until the top 100 starters for 2025 fantasy baseball. I call this tier, “I’m using the milkrowave.” Is using the microwave fun? No. Is it fun to use the microwave and call it the milkrowave? Yes, undeniably. That’s this tier. Guys who are likely just using microwaves, but it’s late and I’m enjoying myself by pronouncing it milkrowave, making these guys fun. Last year, in this tier I ranked Shota Imanaga, who moved way up. Plus, some guys like Brandon Pfaadt, Kutter Crawford, and MacKenzie Gore, who are doing a little better. Then there’s Brayan Bello, who is back again, guess who’s back, I just told you. Tell a friend. Tell a friend what? I just told you he’s back again. The great news is Reid Detmers is finally no longer in this tier. [puts hands together in prayer] Small miracles. This is so late you could’ve dropped any of these guys and grabbed one of the better ones in most leagues. I’m not saying to do it, but you could prolly only draft starters from this tier in shallower leagues and be fine.

As for Jobe, already gave you my Jackson Jobe fantasy. It was written going along for the ride. One word of caution here, if Jobe doesn’t look like he’s going to break camp, I will slide him down in my rankings. Last bit of news I saw, he will get every opportunity to break camp as 5th starter. 2025 Projections: 8-8/3.47/1.29/122 in 134 IP

71. Nick Lodolo – His nickname LodoYOLO is so perfect because that’s exactly what the feeling is going to be when you draft him. Are you getting a breakout 2.75 ERA or are you getting a 5+ ERA guy who will be hurt by May? LodoYOLO! Are you getting a 12+ K/9 or 9 K/9? LodoYOLO! Are you getting 175 IP or 35 IP? LodoYOLO! 2025 Projections: 7-7/4.09/1.27/144 in 129 IP

72. Matthew Boyd – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the Cubs. Yes, I am also intrigued. To not be intrigued, you have to be null and void of emotions. A spider caught in its own web that just shrugs and withers away. Last year, he went 10.4 K/9, 3 BB/9 and a 2.72 ERA, and Wrigley’s been playing very pitcher heavy of late. It feels like a no-brainer and it’s not not a no-brainer, triple negatives aside, but he’s thrown 124 IP total going back three seasons. You average 40-ish IP a year, and I can only get so excited. Not to mention, his most innings thrown was in 2023 when he had a 5.45 ERA. There’s glimmers here, but he is a flyer.” And that’s me quoting me! 2025 Projections: 6-5/3.83/1.24/98 in 95 IP

73. Tomoyuki Sugano – Here’s what I said this offseason, “Signed with the O’s. He’s going to push my theory that we only really want command specialists to the limit. In 156 2/3 IP last year, he had a 0.9 BB/9 and a 0.95 WHIP when he allowed 16 total walks. His Ks might not play here. I’m fine with a 7 K/9. Would prefer a 7.5 K/9. He’d be an ace if he could musterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr (sorry, listening to Kendrick) an 8 K/9, but a 6.4 K/9 in Japan? What’s he gonna do here? A 5? I don’t know if he’s gonna play for mixed leagues, but I’m fine with the 12-team mixed league flyer to see if he can surprise MLB hitters for the 1st half of the year. Figure the best case scenario is he dances on the edge of the plate, then his Ks go up as no one eats.” And that’s me–well, you know. 2025 Projections: 8-6/4.02/1.09/107 in 161 IP

74. Brayan Bello – His exceptionally meh year is perhaps accentuated by his teammates who did a little bit better. Why can’t you be more like Houck or Kutter who are marginally better? Hmm…hmm….hmm?! Scared of success, Bello?! Well, the truth is, Bello is marginally better, and just needs to translate that to on-the-field success, and he has peripherals that could easily see him leapfrogging his marginally-better-last-year teammates. (I got hyphen crazy.) 2025 Projections: 11-10/3.98/1.31/158 in 167 IP

75. Mitch Keller – He was a sleeper last year and that will be the last time we ever mention that. If you mention a guy was a sleeper last year after the posted-on-date-of-rankings, you get fined $5. Thanks a lot, Commiefornia! Keller was supposed to take a step forward. Instead, he did almost exactly the same thing from one year to the next. Well, there’s always a chance he gets better this year (after he’s traded to the Yanks at the deadline). 2025 Projections: 10-10/4.04/1.24/177 in 181 IP

76. Tobias Myers – Ya know who Tobias Myers reminds me of? A pitcher who a younger and dumber Grey would’ve written a sleeper post about. Tried to be less stupid with my sleepers this year (good luck!) than that incredibly Young Dumb Grey guy from last year. 2024 Grey would’ve done some stupid shizz like named Myers a sleeper and…Ugh, the urge is growing and I wish I wrote the Tobias Myers sleeper. Brewers are perfect little angels when they’re developing pitchers. Could he break out this year and be a top 40 starter? He was nearly a top 40 starter last year! Damn, I should’ve written the Tobias Myers sleeper! Ugh, Younger Dumb Grey was so much smarter! UPDATE: Will start year on the IL, but should be back in April. Still like him, but tamped down his innings. 2025 Projections: 8-7/3.81/1.15/123 in 136 IP

77. Bubba Chandler – lready gave you my Bubba Chandler fantasy. It was written while dropping it like it was hot. 2025 Projections: 8-10/3.95/1.36/153 in 138 IP

78. Gavin Williams – Saw that he only threw 76 IP, and I forgot why, so I did a little research. There was about 20 seconds there were I was whispering, “Please be a flukey leg injury…maybe a comebacker and he had a bad bruise? Please…” And no. He missed three months last year with elbow issues and had a fairly forgettable season. His velocity was fine, and his strikeouts weren’t bad. I don’t really want want want him, but if the price is this good, I’m fine with the flyer. 2025 Projections: 9-8/4.09/1.35/124 in 120 IP

79. Nick Martinez – Finally, a very sexy name! Let’s check out those peripherals! Ooh, a barely 7 K/9! Damn, sookie sookie! In Cincy? A terrible park? Yeah, baby! A guy who turns 35 this year? Oh, hecks yeah! So, Nick Martinez isn’t the most exciting and is likely ranked higher in my ranks than anywhere, but he is still kinda buried if you want to ignore him. I still very much like him and he’s ranked way higher than his ADP. It’s all about the 1.1 BB/9. Plus, he had a 53.8 GB% the year before. I’m getting hot under the collar for a very boring starter! 2025 Projections: 8-10/3.51/1.09/144 in 171 IP

80. Clarke Schmidt – With Schmidt, I might be ranking a reliever in the starters. Alas! Pretty impressed the Yankees held onto Schmidt, but are they actually starting him? If they don’t start him, how long until he’s traded for someone random, like, Bryan De La Cruz? My guess is the Yankees say Schmidt will work out of the pen, then that lasts for about three weeks until Cole, Rodon, Fried, Gil or Stroman or many combinations of them get hurt. 2025 Projections: 8-5/3.47/1.22/119 in 117 IP
