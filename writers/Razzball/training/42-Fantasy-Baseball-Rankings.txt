21. Lawrence Butler – This tier started in the top 20 outfielders. This tier ends at Schwarber. I called this tier, “Goldilocks of adults.” As for Butler, I nearly ranked Butler above multiple guys in the previous tier in the top 20 outfielders. I kinda love Butler like I’m the governor on Benson. There’s much to love here: Power at every level, so 22 HRs last year in only 125 games is the iceberg and that iceberg sunk Oakland and now he’s hitting in a minor league park for home games with some new winds blowing out. The speed is easy 20-steal speed, and the pitch clock could make that 30. He only K’d 23.9% of the time, and in Triple-A he was regularly a sub-20 K% guy. Hard contact and lots of it? Give me more shares please. The only thing that stopped me from being stupid and moving him up, and not being an Adult Goldilocks, was his lack of track record and the A’s might lack counting stats. Saw someone draft Luis Robert Jr. before Butler and I wish I were in that league. 2025 Projections: 84/27/67/.269/23 in 581 ABs

22. Seiya Suzuki – Was the opposite of Butler. I wanted to lower Seiya before Goldlicks’ing him here. Health, increasing Ks, and Cubs really want to trade him were my concerns and they all felt kinda made-up and dumb. He just hit .283, so his Ks went up to 27.4%, but clearly that wasn’t an issue. He’s yet to play a full season, but his numbers were still 21/16/.283. 15th best outfielder on the Player Rater. So, dot dot dot, where am I supposed to rank a guy who is the 15th best outfielder in only 132 games? That much lower than this? Why? I’m fine with the Goldilocks’ing I’ve done here. 2025 Projections: 75/23/81/.281/15 in 519 ABs

23. Riley Greene – Have I mentioned that I wrote a Riley Greene sleeper last year? I did? I’ve mentioned it every day for the last 12 months? Okay, point taken. This ranking is basically same as his ranking on last year’s Player Rater when he went 82/24/74/.262/4 in 512 ABs. That feels like his absolute floor. Tigers didn’t run at all (just barely more than Ohtani himself). That feels more like a Tigers problem than a Greene problem, i.e., they have a bunch of 25/2 hitters, and no 30/30 guys. Greene does appear like he has 12+ steal speed, and not under-five. The power, Hard Hit% and everything is perfect. So, 30/12/.280 or 24/4/.260 again, either way it’s valuable. 2025 Projections: 74/27/86/.274/7 in 527 ABs

24. Anthony Santander – Signed with the Jays because the Dodgers clearly didn’t want him. I kid. But, a thoughtful pause, am I kidding? Jays were so thirsty for a free agency win they gave Santander about three years too many and fifty-plus million more than they should’ve, but it ain’t my money, and, for this year, I still would happily draft him. Is he trending up after a 44-homer season? I’d be shocked. Is he about to fall off a cliff and become former Jays great, Cliff Johnson? [looking at Cliff’s career numbers] No, he’s not. The 80’s were a hilarious time for power hitters. Cliff Johnson and DHs in the 80’s were, like, 15-homer hitters. Cliff Johnson and the DHs would be an awesome band, though. 2025 Projections: 84/36/97/.244/3 in 588 ABs

25. Bryan Reynolds – As a long-time fan and defender of Bryan Reynolds, I want to ask for all his haters to show their face. They will be scorned! Where are The Bryan Reynolds Haters now to tell me he’s not this good? [intern whispers] I was the one who hated Reynolds? Hmm, let’s keep that between us. Reynolds now has 24/10 across the last two seasons and hit .275 last year. You might not like him –I did not for a long time — but [shrugs] his ranking is Goldilocks’d to perfection here. Because I’m a grown-ass adult! 2025 Projections: 84/25/87/.272/10 in 591 ABs

26. Kyle Schwarber – This might be the biggest “Look at me, I’m an adult Goldilocks,” as I put on my big boy pants and admit Schwarber is great, if you’re looking for that. *That* being a 40-homer, .240 hitter. *That* is not *that* bad either. Last year, he raised his average, by leveling off his bat, and hitting the ball more “right over the 2nd baseman” and less “Let me try to do a ba-zoomer over the right fielder’s head” while still doing ba-zoomers! 2025 Projections: 106/40/105/.231/3 in 581 ABs

27. Ian Happ – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Cowser. I call this tier, “Projections, schmjections, but rankings, schmankings.” Can’t believe we’ve gotten this deep into the rankings and I haven’t talked about rankings vs. projections. An incredible omission. Dot dot dot. If not for having discussed this exact topic about 500 other times in previous rankings posts. Any hoo! I will say quickly: Is 18/18/.282 better than 25/10/.245? No, right? Wrong, sucker! It could be, but there’s more to projections and rankings than simply numbers. I’m talking about Michael Harris II vs. Happ here, for unstints, and Harris’s 18/18/.282 is at least equal if not better than Happ’s 25/10/.245 but Happ was the 16th best outfielder last year, and Harris was barely in the top 60. There’s things like this in the rankings that aren’t always readily apparent from projections. I want Happ more because he just puts up solid stats year over year. Trout? More in a shallow league where I can readily replace him when he’s hurt. So, Harris over Trout in deeper leagues? Sure. If you have Trea Turner and Corbin Carroll, you better not be drafting Pete Crow-Armstrong from this tier. There’s more to all of this than simply looking at one guy’s name over another guy’s name. As I’ve said many times in the past, there’s no way anyone is ranking for every single league. That’s why we have rankings for dozens of different leagues. It’s also why it’s so silly when Fantasy Pros ranks the best rankings, even if I was ranked number one last year. 2025 Projections: 86/24/69/.247/12 in 571 ABs

28. Mike Trout – Four of his last five years are so sad. The decline of Mike Trout is depressing. Stupid degenerative back condition. Baseball really is the cruelest sport. We could’ve had one of the best of all-time. Instead, we got one of the best ten-year stretches in baseball history. Still a feat, but Quentin Tarantino ain’t digging feats, ya feel me? 2025 Projections: 48/21/57/.265/5 in 349 ABs



29. Pete Crow-Armstrong – I was so close to writing a PCA sleeper to the point where I searched through my sleeper posts twice looking for it, thinking I did write it. I guess I hadn’t, but I really wanted to. The truly hilarious thing is I don’t know why I didn’t write it. Maybe it was because I felt like he was properly ranked. That’s a point that isn’t made enough. It seems to be that I write a sleeper post and it puts a flashing light on a guy, but just because I didn’t write a post about a guy doesn’t mean he’s not well-liked by me. He’s just well-liked by everyone, maybe. PCA’s ADP seems to fall into that category. I love the 15/30/.230 potential, and everyone does. Well, giddy up, PCA pardners! He has 20-homer power, 40-steal speed and could hit .260+. His one real drawback is the Cubs need to bat him higher in the order. Guys breakout every year, and this year it feels like PCA’s chance. There’s not many guys who could be as huge a breakout as PCA, and you must draft him. I implore you, even if I didn’t write a sleeper on him. 2025 Projections: 59/14/66/.248/32 in 510 ABs

30. Jasson Dominguez – Already gave you my Jasson Dominguez fantasy. It starred in an adult film named Chutzpah & Hoohah. 2025 Projections: 68/26/76/.232/25 in 527 ABs

31. Dylan Crews – Already gave you my Dylan Crews fantasy. It had pretty little butterflies. 2025 Projections: 72/16/67/.258/26 in 517 ABs

32. Heliot Ramos – Already gave you my Heliot Ramos sleeper. It was written while making gaga-goo-goo sounds. 2025 Projections: 79/26/78/.266/10 in 549 ABs

33. Colton Cowser – I eyeballed Cowser’s spray chart (sounds like one of the worst euphemisms you could imagine) and it looks like he would’ve gained three homers last year if the fences were moved in, as they are now. Eyeballing is an inexact science (and, damn, just say what you mean rather than these euphemisms), so take it or leave it, but what I never understand with other projections systems is how they always expect young players to get worse. “He hit 24 homers last year as a rookie? Cool, let’s see if he can barely squeak out 20 homers this year!” Yeah, I don’t know. I don’t love some aspects of his game for batting average, but he swings for homers and has power. 2025 Projections: 74/27/82/.234/11 in 512 ABs

34. Michael Harris II – This is a new tier. This tier goes from here until Robert. I call this tier, “Excavating out my 10-foot skeleton and putting in these guys.” So, after Halloween, as most of us do, I dig a 10-foot grave in my front yard and bury my giant, decorative skeleton until next year when it sticks its hand through the soil around September 1st. Well, I’m digging up Fred, the 10-foot Skeleton, and putting him in the passenger seat of my convertible for the HOV lane, and in his place I’m putting the guys in this tier. Burying them!

As for Megahertz, some day I hope you love someone like projections systems love Megahertz. He’s averaged 17 HRs and 15 steals across two seasons. Last year, he went 16/10/.264. Off year? Sure, okay. During his “great” year, he went 18/20/.293. He’s being drafted way before this. Why? Prolly because projections systems are saying he’s going to have a career year, just as they said last year too. I’m sorry, but I got a squad together called the Megahaterz and all we do is hate on Megahertz, because I just don’t get the love. He is literally (not literally) the only guy who projections systems always think will be better. (Also Vlad Jr.) 2025 Projections: 74/18/62/.282/18 in 523 ABs

35. Christian Yelich – Him and Cody Bellinger were forever linked in rankings and ADP. Why? I honestly don’t know. They really had nothing in common besides always being next to each other in rankings and ADP. Like always until this year. Don’t look it up, it might not have been always. But it felt like always. Now they are sadly linked by “one has a recurring shoulder issue” and “one has one in his back.” Not sure which is worse, but they’re both equally less than ideal. Back feels more recurring. Recurringier? Yeah, that’s a word. Yet, like a cruel father, I separated these two brothers after Bellinger went to the Cubs, because he’s younger and 25/12 feels more achievable than Yelich’s 12/25 for an aging player with back issues. Maybe they’ll find each other again on the Player Rater at the end of the year. One can hope. 2025 Projections: 68/13/63/.281/22 in 461 ABs

36. Randy Arozarena – The Rice Bowl is super fun. He wears cowboy boots and looks like an undercover sheriff in Narcos. His peripherals? Oh man they’re terrible and not fun at all. xBA is a weak stat. It doesn’t work for various reasons. His xBA was .219. Dude. I mean. C’mon. He made some of the worst contact I’ve seen. He makes about the same contact as Nick Fortes. Oh…[climbs to the top of the Empire State Building]…kay. That’s not great, over-the-internet friends. Oh, yeah, and he’s in one of the worst hitting parks. An emoji that is checking the Help Wanted ads because it can no longer emoji. 2025 Projections: 72/19/74/.225/24 in 556 ABs

37. Adolis Garcia – If you’ve followed me for a minute — an Urban Dictionary minute which means you’ve followed me for years — you know I did everything I could to be positive on Adolis. Me love him long time. Tried everything I could to get him in front of Randy, but, at the end of the day, the batted ball profile for Adolis does not age well, and it’s aging rapidly. Also, for merely Randy vs. Adolis: 20/20/.225 vs. 25/10/.225 is advantage Randy, if only barely. 2025 Projections: 71/27/84/.218/10 in 581 ABs

38. Luis Robert Jr. – Has he been traded yet? What, have the White Sox not received Paul Skenes and Oneil Cruz for him? Have they not received Jordan Lawlar, Ketel Marte and Zac Gallen? Are you telling me they’re asking for too much? C’mon, no way. I don’t believe it, because the White Sox are well-run organization and wouldn’t do something silly like that. Chris just Getz it. They just traded Crochet for…Oh, I know, offer a catcher for Robert, that’ll do it. Maybe Pedro Pages for Lou Bob? Any hoo! Looking at LouBob’s previous season and I must warn you, it’s much stinkier than you could ever imagine, if you’re not familiar. Pee-ewe, my stinky, that is bad. He went 14/23/.224 with 47 runs and 35 RBIs in almost 400 ABs! That’s Leody Taveras with worse counting stats. If you’re getting back in on LouBob because you think you’re buying low, well, good luck, but it ain’t me. 2025 Projections: 68/20/58/.233/25 in 518 ABs

39. Alec Burleson – This is a new tier. This tier goes until the top 60 outfielders. I call this tier, “Yo, who da eff is you.” Here’s the thing, we all have blindspots. I’m no different. It’s not because I can’t see something because my gorgeous hair is obstructing my vision. The guys in this tier all are in this blindspot of mine where I have no idea who they are. It’s not that I dislike these guys. I just don’t fully know who they are. Not yet, at least.

40. Lane Thomas – He might be the King of Who Da Eff Is You. Thomas is a 10/30 guy, no, he’s a 15/15 guy, no, he’s a 20/20 guy, no, he’s a 12/35 guy, no no no no no no–Who is you?! I get that he was on the Nats for the 1st half of last year, and that team runs a lot, so that helped him with steals, then he went to the Guardians, and only Jose Ramirez runs there, because he likely has carte blanche, but why does Thomas’s power fluctuate so much? I don’t know who Lane Thomas is, which is fine to draft, but you have account for some variance. 2025 Projections: 71/18/75/.242/20 in 512 ABs
