*Started the week late, pushing the Top 75 Sneak Peek into this weekend, but we are still on schedule with the Deep Positional Dynasty Rankings kicking off next week (and more Team Reports Thursday and Friday)

Pitchers

Spencer Schwellenbach - ATL, RHP, 24.10 - Schwellenbach was a major mid-season target of mine, ringing the 5 alarm target bell in my Rundowns and Dynasty Rankings even when the ERA was over 5.00, writing, "Schwellenbach is officially one of the most exciting young starters in the game. He has the big velocity, he has the big pitch mix, he has plus control, he induces weak contact, he has above average whiffs, and he has three plus secondaries. He’s starting to look like a young near ace." ... and then he finished the season with a 3.35 ERA and 25.4/4.6 K%/BB% in 123.2 IP, universally considered one of the more exciting young pitchers in the game. The buy low window has most certainly been shut for awhile now, but he's still worth acquiring at his new high price. He throws a legit 6 pitch mix and all of the pitches are good. The fastball sits 96.1 MPH and his curve and splitter are his two best bat missing weapons with a 40.9 and 46.3 whiff%. He induces weak contact (4.9% Barrel%), misses bats (27.4% whiff%) and has elite control (top 5% BB% in the league). He's an easy #2 with true ace potential ... as long as he stays healthy. He missed the entire 2022 season with Tommy John surgery, and he really hasn't pitched very much in his career. It's a major question if he can truly put up a true MLB starter workload year after year. I tend to be less risk averse with pitchers, because all of them are risky, but I am factoring in some experience/injury risk here, keeping him in that 2nd tier of young aces. 2025 Projection: 12/3.48/1.10/163 in 155 IP

Reynaldo Lopez - ATL, RHP, 31.3 - Lopez clearly got very lucky in 2024 with a 1.99 ERA vs. 3.88 xERA in 135.2 IP, but with the way he closed out the season, I'm apt to buy his breakout as legit. He put up a 1.74 ERA with a 46/5 K/BB in his final 31 IP. His K/BB numbers were very pedestrian before that, but instead of his ERA regressing towards his K/BB numbers, the K/BB numbers progressed towards his ERA. And he definitely has the stuff to buy in. He throws gas with a 95.5 MPH fastball, and his secondaries miss a ton of bats with his slider leading the way with a 44.3% whiff%, finishing as the 5th most valuable slider in baseball. He battled a minor forearm and shoulder injury in the 2nd half of the season, but he came back from both of them no worse for the wear, so I'm not apt to dock him too much for that. He's in a weird spot where the lucky ERA might inflate his value too high, but at the same time, it doesn't really seem like anybody is buying in too hard. Based on my read, I actually think there might be some value left on the bone here. I'm buying and he seems like he will fall into a very reasonable range this off-season. 2025 Projection: 12/3.61/1.16/168 in 160 IP

Hitters

Michael Harris - ATL, OF, 24.1 - It's an absolutely no brainer to stay (almost) fully in on Harris. I say almost because his stolen bases and speed dropped off considerably in 2024 with 10 steals and a 28.3 ft/sec sprint in 110 games. He had a 29.4 ft/sec sprint in 2022. Some of it could be blamed on a hamstring injury that knocked him out for 2 months, but not all of it could be blamed on that. It seems like the reasonable hope is for him to get to around 20+ rather than 30+, which is still very valuable. And steals can be extremely hard to predict because it often is just a choice of how much a player wants to run, so I wouldn't rule anything out. His plate approach also hasn't improved at all in his 3 years in the bigs with a 39.6% Chase%, and finally he hasn't improved his launch at all with a 7.5 degree launch. Honestly after writing that all out, even I'm questioning if maybe I shouldn't still be all the way in, but when I look at his elite 74.7 MPH swing, 10% Barrel%, 90.5/95.3 MPH AVG/FB EV, 47% Hard Hit%, and 20% K%, I realize there is no way I'm betting against this guy. That just screams electric player, and keep in mind all of those above stats were accumulated in his age 21-23 year old seasons. I don't think we've seen his prime yet, and just a few incremental improvements in a few area could result in absolutely beastly seasons. His development hasn't gone exactly like planned, which is why I wouldn't consider him in that Top 20 ish dynasty asset area, but he's easily still a Top 50 guy. 2025 Projection: 88/23/77/.282/.328/.467/23

Ozzie Albies - ATL, 2B, 28.3 - I'm a little torn on Albies. On the one hand, Albies is still in the prime of his career, and has a long track of excellent production, which makes predicting a bounce back season in 2025 seem very easy. But on the other hand, his 27.2 ft/sec sprint speed was a career low and was below average, he swings a well below average bat with a 69.1 MPH swing, and he chases a lot with a 33.6% Chase%. He also doesn't hit the ball hard enough (32% Hard Hit% in 2024 and 35.5% in his career) to make up for a lot of those deficiencies. He thrives based on the contact (14.9% K%), lift (18.4 degree launch), and pull (48.8% Pull%) profile, but I'm starting to question if this is a profile I want to bet on long term. The profile isn't that much different than Jose Altuve, who has aged just fine, so maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm starting to think that Albies might have more name value than real dynasty value at the moment. I'm not too concerned over the next couple of seasons, but in the medium and long term, I wouldn't be surprised to see him as just a good fantasy player, rather than a true difference maker. 2025 Projection: 83/25/87/.266/.321/.461/16

Bullpen

Raisel Iglesias - ATL, Closer, 35.3 - Iglesias' K/9 fell below 9.00 for the first time in his career with a 8.83 K/9, but with a 31.5% whiff%, I would have zero concerns about that. Not to mention that it also came with career bests in ERA (1.95), WHIP (0.74) and BB/9 (1.69). There are zero signs of a decline with a double plus 4 pitch. The changeup, 4-seamer, slider and sinker put up a .249, .221, .190. and .285 xwOBA, which is quite remarkable. He's old, but he's still elite. 2025 Projection: 5/2.73/0.95/74/33 saves in 65 IP

Atlanta Braves Top 10 2025 Fantasy Dynasty Baseball Prospects

1) Drake Baldwin - ATL, C, 24.1 - Baldwin has a path to playing time problem with Sean Murphy under contract through 2028 at least, and I don't see why Atlanta would be motivated to trade either one of them (although it's certainly possible). Both of their bats are good enough to get some DH at bats, so I think both could theoretically survive even without a trade, but it cuts majorly into the projected playing time for them over the next several years. It's a shame for fantasy, because Baldwin is proving to have one of the most exciting prospect catcher bats in the game. He destroyed Triple-A with 12 homers, a 92.8 MPH EV, a 16.2/15.6 K%/BB% and 135 wRC+ in 72 games. He has the power, contact and plate approach to be a Top 5 fantasy catcher at peak, but along with Sean Murphy, there are a few things keeping me from going too crazy. His 96 wRC+ in 52 games at Double-A was not as good as his Triple-A run. His 7.7 degree launch isn't great and his groundball rates have been pretty high in the upper minors. His hit tool is also projected to be closer to average at best, rather than a truly impact tool. You don't need to be all that great to be one of the top hitting catchers in baseball, but tack on Sean Murphy to all of that, and he lands more as a Top 100 prospect for me rather than one I'm really targeting. 2025 Projection: 18/5/22/.238/.307/.399/1  Prime Projection: 64/20/78/.260/.335/.438/1

2) Cam Caminiti - ATL, LHP, 18.8 - Selected 24th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Caminiti has a lot of things working in his favor to give him the best chance at success. He has baseball bloodlines as the nephew of Ken Caminiti, he got drafted into one of the best pitching development organizations in baseball, and he's young for his class. He's not just narrative though, he has a strong foundation for Atlanta to build on at 6'2'', 205 pounds with a mid 90's fastball that is a whiff machine and has double plus potential. The secondaries aren't as refined, but he has a traditional starters pitch mix (slider, curve, change), and he also looked really good in his pro debut. He went 3 IP with 3 hits, 1 ER and a 4/0 K/BB at Single-A. The fastball sat low to mid 90's and the slider looked good. He threw the ball over the plate. I think #2/3 starter upside is fair to put on him right now, but he's so young with so much development time ahead, his range of outcomes is wide. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 12/3.71/1.18/190 in 180 IP

3) AJ Smith-Shawver - ATL, RHP, 22.4 - Shawver was an absolute rocket ship in 2023, flying from the lower minors straight through to the majors, but he got a dose of reality in 2024. He put up a 4.86 ERA with a 28.5/11.0 K%/BB% in 87 IP at Triple-A. He might not have been the wunderkind we hoped for, but he's still a good pitching prospect with a 95 MPH fastball that gets good movement and misses bats. The secondaries are good too with a changeup that notched a 42.3% whiff% and 84.8 MPH EV, a slider that notched a 34.8% whiff% and 86.1 MPH EV, and a decent curve that notched a 81.6 MPH EV and 23.9% whiff%. That is 3 potentially above average to plus pitches with a decent 4th pitch. Even with below average control, that profile could work as a #3/4 type starter, but what would really pull this entire thing together is a big step forward in control/command. Atlanta is also a great organization to bet on for pitching prospects. He's more of a Top 200 guy than Top 100 one, so his value certainly took a hit, but I would try to stay strong one more year if you can. 2025 Projection: 4/4.32/1.36/83 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.95/1.31/155 in 150 IP

4) Hurston Waldrep - ATL, RHP, 23.1 - Waldrep had an impressive pro debut in 2023 which had his stock rising, but his numbers weren't as impressive when he got to Double-A, and that proved to be a precursor for what to expect in 2024. He put up a 3.47 ERA with a 23.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. Those K/BB numbers are not very impressive against minor league competition, and he was atrocious in the majors with a 16.71 ERA and 8.3/22.8 K%/BB% in 7 IP. The devastating splitter lived up to the hype and is definitely an at least plus bat missing weapon, but that seems to really be all he has. The fastball sits in the mid 90's, but it doesn't miss many bats, the slider is average at best, and the control is well below average. This is a profile that can so easily end up in the bullpen, and it looks like it might be headed there right now. I'm not giving up on him as a starter, and he could be someone who transitions back into the rotation even if he starts his career in the pen, but this wasn't the year we wanted out of Waldrep. His value took a hit in 2024. 2025 Projection: 2/4.09/1.34/58 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.56/1.26/77 in 68 IP

5) Owen Murphy - ATL, RHP, 21.6 - Murphy was one of the top pitching prospect breakouts in 2024 with an uptick in stuff and dominant production, but the ghost of Tommy John got another one with Murphy undergoing Tommy John surgery in early June. That likely keeps him out for most or all of 2025, but it does give him enough of a cushion to prove he's healthy by the end of the season and possibly into the AFL, so there could be some budding hype by this time next year assuming full health. And if he hadn't gotten hurt, the hype could have been hitting hard already with a 1.54 ERA and 38.7/7.7 K%/BB% in 41 IP at High-A. The fastball only sits low 90's, but it gets a ton of movement and is a plus pitch. The slider and curveball both still need refinement, but the slider in particular will flash at least plus. And the control/command is potentially plus with an extremely easy and athletic righty delivery. He's not necessarily that in your face, upper 90's, mountain of a man pitching prospect (6'1'') that will get no doubt elite pitching prospect love, but he's the one who will sneak up on you real fast until he's all of a sudden doing it against MLB hitters. The injury obviously complicates things, but I like him enough to not have it kill his value. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.87/1.23/152 in 150 IP

6) JR Ritchie - ATL, RHP, 21.9 - If you want to make a case for Owen Murphy, you don't have to look very far, because JR Ritchie just showed what it looks like to have everything go smoothly returning from Tommy John almost the exact same time as Murphy underwent the surgery (just one year earlier obviously). Ritchie looked like he could have been headed for a breakout in 2023 before undergoing the surgery in late May, and he not only was able to return before the end of 2024, but he shined. He put up a 2.90 ERA with a 27.3/8.3 K%/BB% in 49.2 IP between 3 levels (rookie, A, A+). He looks the part at 6'2'', 185 pounds with a low to mid 90's fastball, starter's pitch mix, and potentially above average or better control/command. Both the slider and changeup are legit weapons, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out, and the fastball certainly has the ability to tick up into the mid 90's considering it was closer to the mid 90's before the injury. With a normal off-season, there is a chance he could look even stronger across the board in 2025, making him a very reasonably priced breakout option. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.27/154 in 160 IP

7) Nacho Alvarez - ATL, SS/3B/2B, 22.0 - Nobody is a bigger Nacho fan than me. I named him a super deep sleeper in his FYPD class for deep leagues, and seeing him blossom has been fun to watch, but unfortunately, he's still really only a deep league option. The power/speed combo is just far too lackluster with an 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A and below average speed. He's also not a lift and pull guy, so he can't fall back on that either. The hit tool and plate approach are great with a 15.6/12.8 K%/BB% at Triple-A, but that immediately didn't transfer to the majors with a 31.3/0.0 K%/BB% in 32 PA. He was 21 and it's a super small sample, so I'm not giving it too much credence, but considering the below average power/speed combo, that hit tool/approach needs to be bulletproof. It sure looks like a utility player to me, or a low end regular. 2025 Projection: 11/2/13/.248/.297/.353/2 Prime Projection: 76/13/62/.276/.338/.411/10

8) Drue Hackenburg - ATL, RHP, 23.0 - I was very low on Hackenburg this off-season because he wasn't very good in college and because of his below average bloodlines (I say this tongue in cheek as a Penn State and Jets fan living through the Christian Hackenberg years), but he proved the Braves right for picking him in the 2nd round, putting up a 3.07 ERA with a 26.3/11.3 K%/BB% in 129 IP spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He's a built up 6'2'', 220 pounds with mid 90's heat, a diverse pitch mix, and a bat missing secondary in his curve. The control is below average and that curve is really his only standout pitch, so even with him beating my expectations, it's still likely a back end starter with mid-rotation upside. 2025 Projection: 2/4.50/1.41/42 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.09/1.32/145 in 160 IP

9) Luis Guanipa - ATL, OF, 19.4 - Guanipa was one of the top breakout targets from the 2023 international class, and while he's yet to truly explode, he remains a very enticing high upside option. He played well in the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 2 homers, 4 steals, a 12.3% K% and 112 wRC+ in 20 games, but he struggled hard when he got the ball to Single-A with a 42 wRC+ in 32 games. The 25.7/8.1 K%/BB% shows he wasn't completely lost, and at only 18 years old with very little pro experience, I wouldn't kill him too much for struggling there. Plus speed and potentially plus CF defense are his best two attributes right now, and he's starting to lock in at least a pretty good feel for contact. Contact, defense and speed is a pretty safe profile that also has fantasy upside. How much power he gets to is the ultimate question, and while he's an explosive player, he's not a big guy and he hit the ball on the ground a decent amount this year. He wasn't that to the moon prospect we hoped for, but there is still a nice little combination of floor and upside in here. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/16/66/.265/.325/.416/24

10) Jose Perdomo - ATL, SS, 18.6 - Perdomo received the highest signing bonus in the international class at $5 million, but unfortunately he was limited to just 8 games in the DSL due to a hamstring injury. He didn't do much in those 8 games with a 66 wRC+, but the 18.2/9.1 K%/BB%, 37.5% GB%, and 2 steals all look fine, so basically the sample is too small to say anything. We have to give him a mulligan and run it back in 2025. He's known for his excellent hit tool with the ultimate power/speed combo still in some question. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but it seems he's trending towards power over speed right now. There is plenty of time for him to change his body in multiple ways, so we'll see which way he decides to go. I'll split the difference for now and assume it will end up a hit tool first profile with a moderate power/speed combo, but there is still so much mystery here. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 78/18/72/.268/.327/.429/15

Just Missed

11) Didier Fuentes - ATL, RHP, 19.9 

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

The Braves and Angels kicked things off with the first big-ish trade of the off-season, swapping Griffin Canning for Jorge Soler.  I don't think this changes Soler's value too much. Really anything but San Francisco will do, and the Angels had a much better park for righty homers than the Braves park, so this might actually be a slight positive. He makes for a solid win now power bat target, and his price might be slightly depressed due to playing in the hitter's hell of SF for most of the season. As for Canning, this breathes at least the slightest bit of life in him after a very disappointing 2024. I liked him as a later round target this off-season, but the velocity on his fastball was down 1.3 MPH, and it tanked the whiff% on the pitch from 28.3% to 14.7%. His overall whiff% went from an impressive 29.1% (and has been about that high or better his entire career) down to a career low 24.4%. He just got worse and demolished everywhere you look basically. The Braves are a great organization for pitching, so this definitely helps, but I'm still not going back to the well this year. He's merely a late draft dart throw, but a slightly better dart throw than he would have been on the Angels.
