Welcome to Dynasty Baseball Catchers Rankings Week!

Nov 18, 2024

The Dynasty Baseball Positional Rankings have arrived, and we kick off the festivities with catchers. Nobody wants to pay up for one, but when you are getting terrible production during the season, you start to maybe question that strategy a bit (I know I have in my 18 teamer). I'll run through everyone from the elite studs, to the diamonds in the rough, to even just down to the rough in the rough at the very back of the rankings. Even 30 teamers need some love. I went over 70 deep last year, so I figure I will end up around there again. First post will drop tomorrow. Catch you then ... pun intended, my bad ;) ...
