Predicting the Top 50 2026 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings

New
March 5

I'm on hour 10 of "Awaken Your Psychic Abilities" YouTube music and tones video, and the visions of the future have now been revealed to me. I swat away the next big stock risers. Winning Lotto numbers? Who cares. How to avoid WWIII? I'll figure that out later. I only have future third eyes for what the 2026 Top 50 Dynasty Baseball Prospect Rankings will look like ... and it's beautiful. My regular rankings are where you should look to make your real team decisions, as this list has nothing to do with me. I am just a mere vessel for the baseball gods ;) Here is the Predicting the Top 50 2026 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings which doubles as a Bold Predictions article:

**Before we get to this year's list, here is a recap of last year's Predicting the Top 50 2025 Dynasty Baseball Prospects Rankings (Patreon)

My best hits were predicting Roki Sasaki will get posted, be the #1 prospect in baseball and sign with the Dodgers.

-Travis Bazzana gets drafted 1st overall and is the top pick in FYPD Drafts. Also nailed Chase Burns at 2nd overall to the Reds

-Sebastian Walcott and Noah Schultz both explode into undeniable elite prospects

-Josue De Paula's stock rises

-Tink Hence bounces back

-Felnin Celesten will rise but will still be underrated

-Andy Pages will rise and closed his blurb out with "He'll have a .316 wOBA vs. .339 xwOBA, and be a great underrated target going into 2025." He had a .310 wOBA vs. .321 xwOBA and is a great underrated target going into 2025.

Worst misses were Spencer Jones will bring the K rate down to under 30% and explode

-Druw Jones will have a big bounce back

-Dylan Lesko will shake of the rust and be an elite pitching prospect

-Roderick Arias will go full breakout

-Dillon Head will be Max Clark lite

-Jun-seok Shim will be healthy and dominant

-John Cruz. That is all. Just that he even exists

Now on to this year's list!

1) Leodalis De Vries - SDP, SS, 19.6 - It's going to be the Chourio, Holliday, Langford conundrum all over again with three legit #1 overall worthy prospects sitting atop the rankings. They will be ordered in every which way possible on all of the different rankings sites out there, and who should be #1 overall will be the dominant off-season debate going into the 2026 season. I will be extremely high on all 3 in my 2026 Top 1,000 Dynasty Rankings, ranking them 23rd, 24th and 25th overall, and will sweat out all off-season if I made the right decision with going De Vries first. I was so far correct about having Chourio first overall out of that above group, so I will stick to my guns with Leo as the top dog, even though most places will have Jenkins or Walcott first. De Vries ability to lift the ball will be the difference maker for me.

2) Walker Jenkins - MIN, OF, 21.1 - Jenkins will continue to be in absolute lock step with Kyle Tucker's career arc. He actually recently talked about how he viewed 2024 as a down year for him. The only thing he didn't do in 2024 was hit homers. He will be a man on a mission to hit dingers, and like Tucker, he will hit 20+ homers split between High-A and Double-A. He will rank 1st overall on most mainstream prospect lists.

3) Sebastian Walcott - TEX, SS, 20.1 - I will fight every urge in my body to once again say that I was the first guy on Walcott, and will just bury those feelings deep down as he gets ranked 1st on other lists, while everyone asks me why I hate Walcott so much for only having him 3rd. Such is the life of a prospector. You either die a hero, or live long enough to be the low man on the guy you were actually the high guy on when it mattered. Walcott will continue to show off the charts tools that lap even De Vries and Jenkins, but his game will still be slightly raw compared to theirs, having me leaning him as the 3rd head of the 3 headed monster.

4) Konnor Griffin - PIT, OF, 19.11 - Griffin will have the explosion that everyone who passed on him in first year player drafts feared he would have. The hit tool concerns will be overblown as he maintains an under 25% K% at Single-A, and the power/speed combo will shine with 16 homers and 48 steals in 102 games. He'll basically be the 2026 version of the 2025 version of Sebastian Walcott. Off the charts tools and a better than expected hit tool.

5) Justin Crawford - PHI, OF, 22.3 - Crawford's GB% will improve for the 2nd year in a row, coming much closer to the semi reasonable 50% mark, and that will be all he needs for his speed, contact, and raw power to do the rest. He will get a small taste of the majors to close out the season where his groundball rate will spike again, but the raw power, speed, and contact rates will lock in his special talent. It will be Carl Crawford 2.0.

6) Felnin Celesten - SEA, SS, 20.7 - Celesten will finally stay healthy for long enough to establish himself as the truly elite prospect. His explosive athleticism and raw power will dominate the lower minors, which he will combine with a strong plate approach, leading to a 141 wRC+ at Single-A before closing out the season at High-A with a 123 wRC+. The groundball rates will still be high, but they will be closer to the 50% mark than the 60%+ he put in 2024. He's going to be a hype beast.

7) Roki Sasaki - LAD, RHP, 24.5 - I don't want to believe it either, but Sasaki will feel elbow soreness in May, hit the IL, and then succumb to Tommy John surgery with an internal brace procedure after throwing 33.2 IP in the majors. He'll be under the 50 IP threshold, so he'll be back on prospects lists, even though he shouldn't have even been on them in the first place. That is just the life of a flamethrowing pitcher. Don't kill the messenger.

8) Braylon Payne - MIL, OF, 19.7 - Payne will prove his small sample pro debut, and now small sample Spring debut too (140 wRC+ with a 33.3% GB%, 66.7% Pull% and 20%/20% K%/BB% in 5 PA) were not a mirage, and it will become obvious that this is a special talent. The K% and GB% won't be nearly as bad as feared pre draft, the power will continue to tick up, and the speed will be elite. This will be an unassailable elite prospect.

9) Josue De Paula - LAD, OF, 20.10 - De Paula will continue to plus plate approach his way through the minor leagues because there is no reason for him to stop doing that while it's working so well. He's doing it in Spring too with a 15.4/23.1 K%/BB%, 226 wRC+ and a 71.4% GB% in 13 PA. Double-A won't slow him down at all when he gets his shot, but he still won't have unleashed his full game power potential, keeping him just outside the true elite prospects of the game.

10) Max Clark - DET, OF, 21.3 - I call Kyle Tucker the quiet killer of MLB, and for the minor leagues, that crown might have to go to Max Clark. Super basic names seem to just sap the excitement out of some players. If his parents named him Kingston Clark, the hype might be off the charts already. He will continue to just quietly kill minor league pitching with his power ticking up into the mid teens area. The profile will completely transfer when he gets the call to Double-A in the 2nd half. He'll be the potential elite dynasty asset who doesn't quite get ranked like that

11) Jaison Chourio - CLE, OF, 20.10 - The power will come for Chourio in 2025. He will jack out 14 homers in 110 games at High-A while continuing to show the excellent plate approach and speed. Everyone says Jaison doesn't have the build of Jackson, but I don't know looking at this picture, sure seems the only difference is Jackson's CouplaBeers beer belly going on there ... hah, obviously it's not a beer belly, but sure seems like Jaison can continue to put on that good weight and see power gains into his mid 20's. This power uptick will just be the start.

12) Jesus Made - MIL, SS, 18.11 - The visions are getting a bit blurrier, not seeing things so clear ... the devil on my shoulder is starting to creep in, urging me to be the contrarian on Made. Tell them you see struggles ahead, tell them he won't be the one ... but no! I'm fighting that devil on my shoulder, not trusting it. Made will start the season in full season ball and he will do to Single-A what he did to the DSL. He will hit the ball hard all over the field with speed and a plate approach well beyond his years. The game power won't be fully materialized, but it won't be hard to project a lot more coming in future years. He will be the favorite for the 2027 #1 overall prospect in the game.

13) Marcelo Mayer - BOS, SS, 22.3 - With Kristian Campbell and Roman Anthony ahead of Mayer on the depth chart, and with how stacked Boston is, Mayer will stay under the 130 AB threshold. But only barely as he'll get the call in late August, and while the surface stats won't pop, he will put up an impressive combination of underlying hitting numbers. The bat speed and hard hit numbers will pop, the whiff rates will be in a stable range, and he'll run more than expected. The logjam will unfortunately continue to make him a tough player to rank though.

14) Josue Briceno - DET, C/1B, 21.6 - Briceno will have a Samuel Basallo like rise through the minors, where it just becomes more and more obvious that this dude is one of the more special, potential middle of the order bats in the minor leagues who can also play a decent catcher. He will carry over the AFL success into High-A where he'll crack 16 homers with an 18.8/12.9 K%/BB% in 89 games before closing out the season at Double-A and holding his own with a 107 wRC+. He will get tons of both fantasy and real life list love.

15) Dean Curley - PIT, SS, 21.11 - With the 6th overall pick in the 2025 MLB Draft, the Pirates will select Dean Curley. They have a gaping hole at SS, and Curley will immediately be the favorite to take over that job in the long term. They are stacked at pitching, and need the ready made MLB bat. After a huge Junior year breakout where Curley leads Tennessee to back to back Championships, Curley will have one of the top pro debut breakouts, obliterating the lower minors with across the board destruction. He with then close out the season at Double-A with an above average wRC+. He will become my top target in the first round of First Year Player Drafts, and will be the guy I'm shouting at the rooftops to grab.

16) Marek Houston - SEA, SS, 21.11 - With the 3rd overall pick in the 2025 MLB Draft, Seattle will select Marek Houston. Houston will maintain the early season power surge all season, and combined with his good SS defense, feel to hit, and speed, he will rocket up to the top of draft boards as a player without a weakness. Seattle has a lot of young talent at SS, but all of them will end up moved off the position, leaving Houston as the true Seattle SS of the future. Having to hit in Seattle will ding his fantasy value just a touch, and he won't have quite as good of a pro debut that Curley had, leaving me preferring Curley in first year player drafts, but it will be a coin flip.

17) Michael Arroyo - SEA, 2B, 21.5 - The little man discount strikes again. Despite having all of the great surface and underlying metrics you would want to see from an elite lower minors prospect, Arroyo's 5'8'' stature keeps him fair away from that elite range. But in 2025 we won't be able to ignore it any longer, playing the 2nd half of the season at Double-A where he puts up a 128 wRC+ with 10 homers and 10 steals in 60 games. Let's be honest, he still won't fully get the respect he deserves, but close enough

18) Zyhir Hope - LAD, OF, 21.2 - The Great Zyhir Hope debate this off-season won't be so easy to settle, as Hope will maintain the same profile he showed at Single-A at High-A. He will keep on hitting the snot out of the ball with speed and hit tool issues. The Dodgers are too loaded to move him quickly, so we will have to wait until 2026 for him to get his first shot at advanced pitching.

19) Tai Peete - SEA, SS/3B, 20.0 - Peete is 7 months younger than Bryce Rainer, to give you an idea of where he fits in with the incoming high school class, and he already has a solid season at Single-A under his belt. He'll head to High-A where the K rate will come down closer to the 25% range and the power will tick up naturally, putting up a 16/40 season with a 117 wRC+ in 115 games at the level. His special talent will become obvious, and he'll be one of the most fun players to own in dynasty.

20) Jamie Arnold - WSH, LHP, 22.0 - With the 1st overall pick in the 2025 MLB Draft, Washington will select Jamie Arnold. He will be the very clear and consensus #1 overall player by draft time, and with Washington needing starting pitching, it will be a no brainer. He won't debut in pro ball, keeping his value stable. One of the major FYPD debates will be if you can actually take a pitcher first overall with everything we know about pitchers. There will be no clear cut #1 bat though, making Arnold a very reasonable #1 FYPD selection.

21) Thomas White - MIA, LHP, 21.6 - Arnold vs. White will be the debate that rages all off-season on who should be the #1 pitching prospect in baseball. White will be coming off a season where he conquered Double-A with a 3.33 ERA and 27.9/8.9 K%/BB%. Arnold's control/command edge will give him the nod for me, but White's stuff might actually be a hair nastier. It will be coin flip

22) Brady House - WAS, 3B, 22.10 - Everybody loves the young for their class prospects pre draft, but once they enter pro ball, it's like nobody gives a crap anymore. House was a 20/21 year old who would have been having his big Junior breakout if he went to college, but instead he was sparring with Double-A and Triple-A pitchers. In 2025, he'll get another crack in the upper minors, and he'll do it at a more appropriate age this time. It's going to result in a full blown breakout. We're already seeing the first buds in spring training with a 7.7/15.4 K%/BB% and 153 wRC+ in 13 PA, and that will continue on into the season with a much improved plate approach. The power will tick up again with mid 20's homers. He'll end the season with a cup of coffee in the majors where he will struggle, but the dye will have already been cast on his huge season.

23) Aidan Miller - PHI, SS, 21.10 - The power will arrive for Miller in 2025, blasting 18 homers in 105 games, but questions about the hit tool will arise as the K% spikes to over 25% when he gets to Double-A. His profile will start to become clear as a power over hit middle of the order bat

24) Jace LaViolette - LAA, OF, 22.4 - With the 2nd overall pick in the 2025 MLB Draft, the Angels will select Jace LaViollette. They will stick with their strategy of taking ready made college bats, and after Jo Adell hits .200 again and after Trout gets hurt again, they will lean the power hitting outfielder. In true Angels fashion, LaViolette will close out the season at Double-A, hitting 3 homers with a 35% K% in 10 games. He won't struggle like Condon, but there will be enough hit tool issues in pro ball to make his status as the top dog in FYPD's very murky.

25) Kevin McGonigle - DET, SS/2B, 21.7 - McGonigle is going to stick with what has been working his entire career, and that is being a high contact hitter who has one of the best hit tools in the minor leagues. He'll hit over .300 at High-A with 10 homers and 20+ steals before getting taste of Double-A to close out the season where his K% will barely budge up at all.

26) Colt Emerson - SEA, SS, 20.8 - The power breakout won't come in 2025 as Emerson is still just 19 years old, continuing to produce at High-A with his plus plate skills like he's doing in Spring right now with a 14.3/21.4 K%/BB% and 57.1% GB% in 14 PA. People will start to doubt the power will ever fully arrive, and right as people start cooling on him, it will breakout in 2026.

27) Alfredo Duno - CIN, C, 19.9 - Duno will become the #1 true catcher prospect in baseball, and it will be more in the Francisco Alvarez, fun for fantasy way, and not the better in real life boring way like Gabriel Moreno. He already proved he can easily handle Single-A as an 18 year old, but an injury and some poor home run luck kept his value in check. In 2025, he will be healthy and lucky, blowing up the lower minors with 22 homers and a 130 wRC+ in 105 games split between Single-A and High-A.

28) Brandon Winokur - MIN, SS/OF, 21.5 - The Winotar will get out of Minnesota's extreme pitcher's park in Single-A to a more neutral High-A Park, and his homer totals will spike, going 21/25 with a 26.9% K% in 111 games. He'll do it while displaying an up the middle glove that could actually be an asset too. Both real life and fantasy writers will start to drool all over this guy.

29) Aidan Smith - TBR, OF, 21.8 - With a full off-season under Tampa's guidance, Smith will blow up, lifting and pulling his way to a 17/30 season with a 135 wRC+ at High-A. He'll close the season out at Double-A where the K rate won't spike and stay under 25%, which will add confidence as we head into the off-season.

30) Jarlin Susana - WASH, RHP, 22.1 - Hunter Greene 2.0. Greene had 3.30 ERA with a 31.7/8.9 K%/BB% in 106.1 IP in the upper minors in his age 21 year old season, and Susana will follow in his footsteps, except with a 10%+ BB%. The control issues will still keep him out of the true projected ace category, but he'll fall just under that.

31) Chen-Wei Lin - STL, RHP, 23.10 - Everyone all at the same time will realize there is an athletic 6'7'' flamethrower with mid to upper 90's heat, multiple bat missing secondaries, a diverse pitch mix, and average control. There is like a spell on him right now, where you can see him, but it doesn't register. The spell will lift in 2025, and everyone will be like, holy shit, where has this guy been! But he will have been right in front of our eyes the entire time. He will dominate High-A and then close out the season at Double-A where he will prove the stuff will translate. The hype is going to hit hard.

32) Hunter Barco - PIT, LHP, 25.4 - Barco will be the Spencer Arrighetti of 2025. He's the guy who gets no respect until he gets the call to the majors in the 2nd half and puts up a 3.78 xERA, 4.41 ERA, and a 27.2/9.3 K%/BB% in 44.1 IP. He'll be another victim of velocity discrimination, with people not buying in until he proves it in the majors. He will be everyone's favorite "sleeper" going into 2026, making him not a sleeper at all.

33) Cam Collier - CIN, 3B, 21.4 - The most underrated power hitter in the minors will continue to be the most underrated power hitter in the minors, because that is how these things generally work out. Collier will put in Yeoman's work at Double-A, jacking 21 homers with a 26.5% K% in 115 games at Double-A as a 20 year old, and you will barely hear about it.

34) Lazaro Montes - SEA, OF, 21.5 - Montes has somehow become underrated, and he's already showing how silly that is this spring with 2 homers and a 326 wRC+ in 12 PA. No psychic ability needed here. He will be a low BA, high OBP slugger no matter the level, finishing the year at Double-A with 8 homers and a 30.3 K% in 45 games.

35) Emil Morales - LAD, SS, 19.6 - The Dodgers won't start Morales in full season ball, instead waiting until the stateside rookie season starts to get our first looks at him, which will slow down the hype a bit. But stateside rookie will be no trouble for him, eventually getting the call to Single-A to close out the season where he'll pop 5 homers in 15 games with a 28.7% K%. He'll continue to show more speed and athleticism than is given credit for, the power will be top of the scale, and the strikeout rate will remain in the acceptable range. He wasn't in full season ball long enough to really be considered an elite guy, but he will show enough for the hype to start to bubble.

36) Ethan Holliday - STL, SS, 19.1 - With the 5th overall pick in the 2025 MLB Draft, St. Louis won't be able to resist the pull of reuniting with the Holliday family. Matt played 8 years with St. Louis, and they will welcome Ethan in with open arms. Being in a bit of a rebuild, they will embrace the long term upside rather than go for a safer college player. Holliday will debut at Single-A where he will put up a 103 wRC+ with 1 homer, 3 steals, and a 28% K% in 11 games. Value will hold serve.

37) Munetaka Murakami - SEA, 3B, 26.6 - The Dodgers will finally not be the team to sign the superstar player coming over from Japan. Seattle will swoop in and finally land that corner bat they so desperately need. Unfortunately, signing with Seattle will ding Murakami's value a bit, because that place is hell to hit in. He has the power to overcome it, so it doesn't tank his value, but it hurts a bit.

38) Termarr Johnson - PIT, 2B, 21.10 - Johnson will get back on mainstream Top 100 prospect lists after a strong season at Double-A, putting up a 129 wRC+ with 15 homers and 24 steals in 113 games. Sure the K rates will remain on the high side, but he will be 20/21 years old at the level, and everything else will be there. There will be talk of him breaking camp with the Pirates in 2026 as their starting 2B.

39) Arjun Nimmala - TOR, SS, 20.6 - Nimmala will carry over his smoking hot 2nd half into 2025, and he will do it with a more refined plate approach in his 2nd full year of pro ball at High-A. It will result in 23 homers with a 127 wRC+ at the level. With his age to level production, wicked quick bat, and high level pedigree, he will rise fast

40) Griffin Burkholder - PHI, OF, 20.7 - Once the production is there, the eye test will do the rest, as Burkholder is an electric factory with build, power, and speed for days. He will put up a 25.4/10.3 K%/BB% with 13 homers, 32 steals, and a 131 wRC+ in 100 games at Single-A before closing out the season at High-A with a 111 wRC+.

41) Welbyn Francisca - CLE, SS, 19.10 - The next little man discount. Francisca's power will finally start to get the credit it deserves, posting impressive exit velocities in full season ball and hitting double digit homers. Combined with plus hit, plus approach, and plus speed, he will have little man discount written all over him.

42) Luis Morales - OAK, RHP, 21.10 - Morales will go Bubba Chandler 2.0. Morales put up a 4.22 ERA with a 24.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 81 IP at High-A while Chandler put up a 4.75 ERA with a 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% in 106 IP at the level. Chandler then went full hype beast breakout the next year. Morales will do almost the same, but not quite

43) Ethan Salas - SDP, C, 19.10 - Salas is the most boring exciting prospect of all time. He's an oxymoron. It's like jumbo shrimp. It doesn't have to make sense. He will boringly hype his way slowly up the prospect rankings, before San Diego excitedly rushes him to the majors where he will put up boring numbers.

44) Cooper Pratt - MIL, SS, 21.8 - The lift and power gains Pratt made at High-A will stick, just like he's showing in spring training with a 22.2% GB% and 186 wRC+ in 10 PA. He will lock himself in as impact all category contributor.

45) Yolfran Castillo - TEX, SS, 19.2 - The last time Texas made a statement with a DSL kid by moving him stateside very quickly, his name was Sebastian Walcott. And last year, they did it with Castillo. Castillo won't be Walcott, but he'll thrive with his own skillset, showing plus hit with increased power and speed in full season ball as an 18 year old. At a projectable 6'3'', it will be so easy to project much more on him in the future. He'll be one of the most fun to own lower minors prospects.

46) Aiva Arquette - MIA, SS, 22.6 - I didn't include Arquette in the 2026 FYPD Top 10, but with the college season gaining steam, he would be in there today if I redid it. Miami will select him 7th overall in the 2025 MLB Draft. He's a wiry 6'5'' SS with a viciously powerful righty swing, and he's massively improving his biggest weakness in the early going with a 7/8 K/BB in 10 games vs. a 40/17 K/BB in 48 games in 2024 (and a 28/8 K/BB in the Cape). He's not a big base stealer, the hit tool/approach will still have risk, and it's not like he's been some beastly power hitter in his career, so I'll still lean him in the 5-10 range of FYPD's.

47) Jonathan Santucci - NYM, LHP, 23.2 - The Mets seem to pull a pitching prospect rabbit out of their hat every year, taking a guy with nasty stuff in the draft, and then quickly refining them in pro ball. It was Brandon Sproat last year (Tidwell the year before). The breakout simply comes one year later than expected, and this year, it will be Jonathan Santucci. Santucci would have been a Top 10 pick with a big Junior year, but he just couldn't corral the stuff. The Mets will corral it and he'll put up an over 30% K% with a 10% BB% in the lower minors. He'll get a taste of Double-A to close out the season where the K rates will transfer, but the walk rate will spike again. It will be enough to get Sproat like hype in 2025.

48) Travis Sykora - WAS, RHP, 21.11 - Sykora gets a late start to the season and won't be fully ramped up until June coming off hip surgery, and it will throw off his season enough to prevent a true blow up. The K/BB won't be as gaudy as it was in 2024, and High-A hitters won't be as completely overmatched as Single-A hitters.

49) Hyun-Seok Jang - LAD, RHP, 21.5 - The Dodgers will find a way to get that control down into a manageable range, putting up an 11.8% BB% in 81 IP in the lower minors, and the absolute filthy stuff will do the rest with a 34.1% K%. There will still be control risk, but the upside will be on full display, moving him into the Top 50 prospect range that Jacob Misiorowski has been sitting in the last couple years.

50) Braylin Antunez - MIL, OF, 18.4 - It's not always the top of the class hyped international prospects who pop. Just look at Jesus Made who wasn't at the top of the class. Antunez will be the Jesus Made of 2025, blowing up the DSL with eye popping EV numbers to go along with speed and a strong plate approach. Milwaukee will do it again.

51) Pablo Guerrero - TEX, 1B/OF, 19.7 - Inject the plus bloodlines right into my veins ... wait ... would that actually work? Can I inject Guerrero blood into my kids veins? I feel like the Illuminati would have these answers already ;) ... The baseball world will finally realize there is another Guerrero kid after he rips 19 homers in 110 games at Single-A. He will bring the K rate down to 26.4%, which is in the reasonable range for this type of power hitter. He will finally get the plus bloodline bump that he deserves.

Fallers

XX) Tyler Bremner - COL, RHP, 21.11 - Colorado spared us last year by not taking a pitcher in the first round, but we won't be so lucky this year when they select Bremner 4th overall. I usually absolutely tank all Coors prospects down my rankings, but Dollander will have flashed enough upside in the 2nd half of the season in the majors that I will loosen up on my stance slightly. Bremner still won't be in my Top 50, but I won't absolutely hate him like I might have pre-Dollander. He will remain in the Top 100 area

XX) Alejandro Rosario - TEX, RHP, 24.3 - I'm getting visions of Rosairo needing Tommy John surgery. The news will break on February 23rd at 11:55 AM. He will fall to just outside the Top 100. I promise, I wrote this blurb beforehand ;)
