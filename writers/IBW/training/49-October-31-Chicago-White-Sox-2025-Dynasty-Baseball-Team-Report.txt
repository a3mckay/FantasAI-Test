Pitchers

Garrett Crochet - CHW, LHP, 25.9 - Paul Skenes is the no doubt #1 dynasty pitcher in the game. I'm not arguing that ... buuuuuuuuuuuut ... what if Crochet is actually better than him? He put up a better K% (35.1% vs. 33.1%), BB% (5.5% vs. 6.2%), Chase% (33.5% vs. 30.9%), and a much better whiff% (33.0% vs. 28.7%). His 97.2 MPH 4-seamer put up a 31.4% whiff% while Skenes' 98.8 MPH 4-seamer put up a 24.2% whiff%. Crochet's cutter put up a 32.7% whiff% while Skenes' sinker notched a 29.3% whiff%. Crochet's sweeper notched a 42.7% whiff% while Skenes' sweeper notched a 22.6% whiff% and his curve notched a 33.7% whiff%. They are both beastly athletes. I described the 6'6'', 245 pound Crochet as a WWE Ballerina in my March Mailbag Podcast. Chicago is trash, so he won't beat Skenes in wins, but just judging who is the better pitcher, I wouldn't be so sure the answer is Skenes, Now along with wins and quality starts, Skenes dusted him on ERA (3.58 vs. 1.96), and even though their xERA's were much much closer (2.83 vs. 2.50), I do think that matters. Crochet also has more of a track record of control problems than Skenes does. Like I said, Skenes is the undeniable #1 dynasty pitcher in the game ... but maybe ... he won't be at the end of 2025. 2025 Projection: 12/3.03/1.03/230 in 170 IP

Sean Burke - CHW, RHP, 25.3 - I know Burke is still prospect eligible, but I wanted to highlight him in this section. Here is what I wrote about Burke right after his first start of the season: "I’m far from ready to call Burke a target, but I will say that there are some interesting things brewing here that deserve our attention. He had his 2nd strong MLB outing in a row, going 5 IP with 5 hits, 2 ER, and a 5/2 K/BB vs. Oakland. The fastball sat 95.4 MPH and put up a 29% whiff%, while the slider and curve were solid as well with a 33% and 30% whiff%. It led to a 31% whiff% overall. His first outing against Cleveland was more of the same, and he now has a 2.25 ERA with a 30.4% whiff% in 8 IP. He has size (6’6”, 230 pounds), velocity (mid 90’s heat that misses bats) and bat missing secondaries (slider, curve change). He didn’t perform well at Triple-A with a 4.62 ERA in 64.1 IP, but all 4 of his pitches missed a ton of bats leading to a 31% K%. Control is the biggest problem here with well below average walk rates his entire career, but super tall pitchers can sometimes take longer to make control gains, and we all know that pitching development isn’t linear. So far in the majors he has a 8.3% BB%. Again, I’m not calling him a target, but I am saying there is some very interesting stuff going on here. There are definitely ingredients for a big breakout in the future, and as a free pick up in the vast majority of leagues, I don’t hate it all. Consider this your first little warning on Burke." ... and after that outing, Burke dominated in 2 more starts with 1 ER and a 14/4 K/BB in 11 IP. If he was able to do it in a larger sample, he might have been valued more closely with Spencer Arrighetti (both have similar-ish profiles), and I'm apt to use the small sample to my advantage. The skills are there are to be a high K mid-rotation starter, and he did prove it on the MLB level. He's an excellent later round target. 2025 Projection: 8/3.96/1.31/149 in 140 IP

Jonathan Cannon CHW, RHP, 24.8 - Chicago really forces you to scrape the bottom of the barrel when looking for interesting players, but at the same time, a team like this gives opportunity to fringy young players who just might be able to take advantage of it. While I don't think Cannon is a good breakout candidate, he has a job, and he has some skills that make him interesting for deeper leagues. He put together a solid rookie season with a 4.49 ERA, 4.37 xERA, and 17.4/7.7 K%/BB% in 124.1 IP. He throws a 5 pitch mix, and while none of them were standout, none of them were too bad either. His 93.3 MPH sinker keeps the ball on the ground with a 6 degree launch, his 94.3 MPH 4-seamer put up a 25.2% whiff% and .273 xwOBA (he should probably throw this pitch more), and his changeup and sweeper were both decent with a .290 and .269 xwOBA, respectively. He also throws a useful cutter. Average control of an average-ish 5 pitch mix can certainly lead to an average starter, and at only 24 years old, there is plenty of tinkering he can do to his pitches and the mix. He's not someone I'm going after and he would have to fall right in my lap, but there are worse fliers in deeper leagues. 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.30/130 in 150 IP

Hitters 

Luis Robert - CHW, OF, 27.8 - Robert is in super juicy buy low territory right now. This one feels like it's served up on a silver platter. He had a down year in 2024 with a career worst 33.2% K% and .224 BA, but he has a 1,944 career PA track record with a 27% K% and .267 BA. He's smack dab in the middle of his prime at 27 years old, and he has near elite bat speed with a 74.5 MPH swing. His 28.8 ft/sec sprint speed was a 4 year high, and he hit the ball very hard with a 90.1 MPH EV. There is no physical decline, and there is a huge track record which says this was simply a down year. And even in a down year he hit 14 homers with 23 steals in 100 games (about a 21/35 pace). It's as easy as could be to buy the bounce back in 2025, but the one real area of concern is injuries. He once again missed a large chunk of the season with a hip injury. He's played in over 100 games just once in his career (2023), and even that year his season ended with a sprained MCL which would have kept him out for a couple months had it not been the end of the season. The White Sox are also terrible, which can't help the motivation, let alone Runs and RBI. Those reasons are why he can't really be in elite or near elite asset territory, but there is easy 30/30 upside in here if he does stay healthy, and that is worth trying to acquire on a discount this off-season. 2025 Projection: 82/23/72/.254/.312/.470/28

Miguel Vargas - CHW, 3B/OF, 25.4 - Vargas' dynasty owners finally got what they wished for when Vargas got traded to Chicago, opening up playing time, but they say be careful what you wish for, because he was atrocious. He put up a 16 wRC+ in 42 games. He hit .104 with .170 SLG. That has got to be close to all time bad in 42 games. His underlying numbers are admittedly still interesting enough with a 21.6% whiff%, 21.8% Chase%, 28.6 ft/sec sprint, and 21.3 degree launch, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough (86.2 MPH EV), and he swings a slow bat (69.8 MPH). He's also not going to contribute much in Runs or RBI even if he does put together a decent season. He's fine as a bottom of the roster type, or as a depth piece in a deeper league, but I'm no longer really eyeing him as an interesting flier type. 2025 Projection: 46/10/39/.219/.299/.368/7

Chicago White Sox 2025 Top 10 Fantasy Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Noah Schultz - CHW, LHP, 21.8 - Baby Johnson is the #1 pitching prospect in baseball, and while there are other really good contenders (Jobe, Bubba, Kumar, Painter), Schultz holds the top spot for being absolutely unprecedented. Even the Baby Johnson nickname might not fit, as Randy Johnson had an insane 318 walks in 400.1 minor league IP before getting the call to the bigs. Schultz is 6'9'', 220 pounds with an almost sidearm lefty delivery that he uses to fire a mid to upper 90's fastball and double plus slider (he also mixes in a cutter and a change). He sliced through the minor with absolutely no problem, putting up a 2.24 ERA with a 32.1/6.7% K%/BB% in 88.1 IP at mostly Double-A. Having that level of control as a 20/21 year old at that size with that kind of stuff is really mind blowing. He's not a finished product as he's yet to eclipse 4 IP in any outing of his career and he needs to continue to work on a good third/fourth pitch, but the combination of floor/upside is simply off the charts. Other than Roki Sasaki (who really shouldn't be considered a prospect), there is no pitching prospect I would take over Schultz. 2025 Projection: 3/3.71/1.24/82 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/2.97/0.96/230 in 180 IP

2) Hagen Smith - CHW, LHP, 21.7 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the White Sox know a thing or two about developing vicious lefty starters with funky deliveries and some control risk. They've done just fine with Chris Sale, Garrett Crochet, and Noah Schultz. The 6'3'', 225 pound Hagen Smith is next on that list with a three quarter arm slot delivery that he uses to fire a double plus mid 90's fastball and double plus slider. Both pitches are whiff machines, leading to a 2.04 ERA and 48.6%/10.3% K%/BB% in 84 IP in the SEC. He also mixes in a splitter, and while he doesn't throw it that often, it's a good pitch when he goes to it. The walk rate is on the high side, and it was worse in his freshman and sophomore seasons with a 13.4% BB% in 148.3 IP. Improving his control/command and turning his splitter into a higher usage 3rd weapon can turn Smith into a true ace. If he can't improve in those areas, a high K, mid-rotation starter is within the range of outcomes (and I guess the bullpen is too, but you don't take a guy 6th overall to use him in the bullpen long term). Add a star for being young for the class, but take a star away for already undergoing Tommy John when he was 16 years old. - 2025 Projection: 2/3.91/1.28/50 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/203 in 175 IP

3) Colson Montgomery - CHW, SS, 23.1 - Montgomery had a pretty damn bad season at Triple-A with 18 homers, an 85.8 MPH EV, a 28.6/12.0 K%/BB% and an 88 wRC+ in 130 games. I've talked about this in a previous year's Strategy Section, but it's easy to assume every down year for a prospect is him regressing as a player, and every monster year is a true breakout, rather than it sometimes just being a down year or a career year. So even though I was a bit lower than most last year on Montgomery, writing, "Those are the reasons that make me hesitant to rank him as high as I see him in other places, but there is no denying he is a damn good prospect no matter how you slice it," I'm still not going to jump ship. His profile remains the same for me as a 6'3'', 225 pound slugger with a clear path to playing time. He also came into the AFL fired up to wash the slate clean with 3 homers, a 6/10 K/BB, and a 1.167 OPS in 11 games, which shows everything you liked about him last off-season is still in here. Hold strong 2025 Projection: 58/18/65/.223/.296/.411/3 Prime Projection: 82/26/88/.247/.332/.465/7

4) Sean Burke - CHW, RHP, 25.3 - See above in the Pitchers Section

5) Edgar Quero - CHW, C, 22.0 - Quero is a super safe catcher prospect with a clear path to playing time. He's had an excellent plate approach his entire professional career, putting up a 17.4/9.7 K%/BB% in 98 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. There is some juice in his bat too with 16 homers, but there isn't huge raw power at 5'10'' (87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A), and the launch isn't very high either (7.2 degrees at Triple-A). It's an above average hit/power combo in the minors which might play as an average hit/power combo in the majors, but at only 22 years old, you can give him a bump for age to level. He's the type that has more value the deeper the league is, because I'm seeing more of a solid than standout hitting catcher. 2025 Projection: 36/10/41/.246/.305/.391/1 Prime Projection: 66/17/72/.266/.339/.434/3

6) Grant Taylor - CHW, RHP, 22.10 - Taylor looked so exciting coming off Tommy John surgery in his pro debut with a 1.13 ERA and 43.1%/4.7% K%/BB% in 16 IP at Single-A over 4 outings, but a lat strain cut his regular season short. He’s 6’3”, 230 with a mid 90’s fastball and a plus breaker as his best pitches. He has high spin rates on all of his pitches. He was the perfect candidate to absolutely blow up with a strong AFL showing, and while he hasn't done that with a 9.45 ERA and 12/6 K/BB in 6.2 IP over 3 outings, he has established that his nasty stuff is legit. The fastball sits mid to upper 90's, the slider is potentially plus, and the changeup is promising. He barely has any track record at all with a career high of 31 IP in 2022 in the SEC (52 IP if you include the 2022 Cape), so it's a mystery if he can stay healthy or if he can maintain this level of stuff over an entire season, but pitchers take this path all the time, and the stuff is undeniable. He definitely has some hype, so his price could vary depending on the league, but I would be more than happy to take a shot on Taylor if you are looking for a high upside arm. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.31/148 in 140 IP

7) Bryan Ramos - CHW, 3B, 23.1 - Ramos did not have a good MLB debut with a .586 OPS in 32 games, and he didn't play particularly well in the minors either with a 98 wRC+ in 64 games at Triple-A, but like I mentioned in the Montgomery blurb, there is still a collection of skills here that I'm buying. Despite the poor MLB debut, he put up a 20.4% K%, 25.5% Chase%, a 90.1 MPH EV, an 11.8 degree launch, and a 28.7 ft/sec sprint speed. For a bad debut, that is a damn good collection of numbers. He was also getting hot at Triple-A towards the end of his stay there with 7 homers and a .894 OPS in his final 37 games, which shows you to not get too hung up on the down minor league numbers either. Chicago has nothing but opportunity, so they are going to give him every chance to establish himself. He might not be a league winner, but 20+ homers with a decent BA and a handful of steals is more than useful in most fantasy leagues. 2025 Projection: 41/13/52/.233/.292/.403/4 Prime Projection: 71/23/80/.252/.318/.450/8

8) Wilfred Veras - CHW, OF, 22.4 - Veras is one of my favorite underrated proximity stashes in the minor leagues right now. He has that perfect mix of talent, upside, production, path to playing time, and absolutely non existent hype. He's 6'2'' with a big righty swing that has easy plus power potential, and he used that to club 16 homers in 128 games at Double-A. He's not a burner but he loves to run, stealing 25 bags in 34 attempts, and I don't see why Chicago wouldn't let him run, especially if they are going to be bad for the next few years. And the most exciting part is that he at least hinted at improving his well below average plate approach in the 2nd half of the season with a 23.2/8.7 K%/BB% in his final 70 games. He was only 21 years old in the upper minors with a 118 wRC+, and his biggest weakness, the plate approach, showed signs of improving. I love taking some high risk, high reward shots on guys who aren't teenagers, so Veras is in that perfect zone of upside and proximity for a cheap price that isn't always easy to find. 2025 Projection: 27/8/36/.221/.280/.389/5 Prime Projection: 69/22/78/.246/.309/.442/13

9) Jeral Perez - CHW, 2B, 20.5 - Perez getting traded from LA to CHI is a major developmental downgrade, and while it does theoretically create a better path to playing time down the line, I don't think the trade off is worth it. Perez has a lot of development left to go as he's only reached Single-A. Having said that, he's still a really good lower minors prospect. I gave him the Andy Pages 2.0 comp, and that really sums him up pretty well. They are both 6'0'' righties with relatively extreme lift and pull profiles, above average to plus raw power, a plus plate approach, and mid 20's K rates. He slashed .262/.370/.423 with 12 homers, 4 steals, and a 22.9/12.9 K%/BB% in 105 games. Andy Pages set a strong foundation for himself in 2024 to be an above average MLB bat, and Perez has the potential to do the same in a few years. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/22/80/.255/.332/.440/6

10) Caleb Bonemer - CHW, SS, 19.6 - Selected 39th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bonemer has one of the top power/speed combos in the high school class with plus run times and electric bat speed. He's performed against advanced competition and has a good feel to hit. He doesn't have the smoothest batting stance/swing, which adds some hit tool risk, and he's not one of those obvious giant human beings with a 6'1'', 195 pound frame, but he's far from small. He's a big, physical guy. He's an excellent upside pick who should come at a reasonable price. I like Bonemer a lot - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 80/20/80/.256/.325/.440/20

11) George Wolkow - CHW, OF, 19.3 - Wolkow was one of my favorite underrated FYPD Targets last off-season, and while he certainly still has his problems, he more than put his name on the map in 2024. The 6'7'' behemoth obliterated the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 148 wRC+ in 15 games, and then he got called up to Single-A as a an 18 year old and cracked 11 homers with 6 steals and a 126 wRC+ in 76 games. This is a no joke unicorn type talent, but like a lot of no joke unicorn type talents, the hit tool is a major question. And for Wolkow, it's getting close to off the charts with a 38.8% K% at stateside rookie and a 40.6% K% at Single-A. He walks a lot too, and he's very young, but that really isn't a strikeout rate you just hand wave away. It's why he really can't be close to consideration for a Top 100 spot, but it won't stop me from valuing him in the Top 200 range. The deeper you get into prospects rankings, the higher the bust rates become for everyone, so why not swing for the fences with a guy like Wolkow. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 75/28/87/.237/.319/.470/9

Just Missed

12) Jairo Iriarte - CHW, RHP, 23.4

13) Drew Thorpe - CHW, RHP, 24.6 - Thorpe had the type of nightmare MLB debut that can shake a dynasty owner to their core, putting up a 13.2/11.1 K%/BB% with a 5.48 ERA in 44.1 MLB IP. He simply doesn't have the type of stuff to just ignore that. His 91 MPH fastball was batting practice for MLB hitters with a 7.7% whiff% and 93.5 MPH EV against. His slider and cutter were bad too. The only good pitch was his unique changeup (really more of a knuckleball) which put up a 37.9% whiff% and .260 xwOBA. He also ended the season on the IL with an elbow injury that required surgery to remove a bone spur. Not the end of the world, but it's something to note. The famed changeup transferring to the bigs gives him a silver lining to the terrible season, but this looks like a low K #4 type upside profile. It's just not enticing for fantasy. 2025 Projection: 6/4.38/1.34/111 in 140 IP

14) Samuel Zavala - CHW, OF, 20.8

15) Blake Larson - CHW, LHP, 19.1 - Selected 68th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Larson has that raw, uncut nastiness that I am just drawn to. Of course the White Sox were the team to pick him, they love this profile almost as much as I do. And that profile is a projectable 6'3'', 185 pound lefty with a funky delivery and filthy stuff. The fastball sits low to mid 90's with tailing action, and the slider is a sharp breaker with at least plus potential. He has a developing changeup as well. He is still raw, he needs to improve his control/command and he needs to refine his changeup, but you know this is a profile I love betting on, and I will bet on it again with Larson. Chicago knows what they are doing with these guys too. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.74/1.31/173 in 160 IP

16) William Bergolla Jr. - CHW, 2B/SS, 20.5

17) Nick Nastrini - CHW, RHP, 25.1

18) Jacob Gonzalez - CHW, SS, 22.10

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Jumping off from the Sean Burke blurb, while others may shy away or not trust the small sample MLB debut, I love going after it, because it creates a perfect combination of being proven on the MLB level and still being very underrated. Of course we all love the safety of a larger sample, but the larger the sample, the more everyone trusts it, and the more everyone trusts it, the less value there is. Pitchers in particular are great small sample targets. The list of pitchers to get called up, look extremely good in a few starts, and still take months to get the respect they deserve is extremely long. You just have to look at the value you could have gotten on Spencer Schwellenbach earlier in the season when I called him a major target extremely fast. Burke ain't Schwellenbach, but you get my point. It's worth it to stick your neck out just a bit to acquire these guys, because the payoff can be huge.
