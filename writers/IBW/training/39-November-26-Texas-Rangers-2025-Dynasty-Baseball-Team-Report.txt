Pitchers

Jacob deGrom - TEX, RHP, 36.9 - I was all over the Tommy John (and age) discount on deGrom last off-season, writing, "We can dig into past arms who returned from 2 Tommy John surgeries (Nathan Eovaldi), but the bottom line is that an elite of the elite player like deGrom can be compared to nobody. Even if he takes one or two steps back, he is coming from such a high place that he will still be a legit ace." It took him a bit longer to return than hoped, but slow and steady wins the race, and as predicted, even with his velocity down 1.4 MPH to 97.3 MPH, he was still such an easy elite ace with a 1.69 ERA and 31.8/2.3 K%/BB% in 10.2 IP. Sure it's a small sample, but do you really need to see more? Of course we need to see more in terms of can he stay healthy and for how many innings, but there is little to no doubt that what he's going to do in those innings is be an elite pitcher. Will his whiff rates be over 40% like they were in 2020-23, highly unlikely, but that is why I was so keen to go after him last off-season. Even if he took two big steps back, he's still possibly the best starter in baseball. That is how far out in front of the pack he was. He hasn't pitched more than 92 IP since 2019, but from 2017-19 he threw over 200 IP, so it's not like he's some guy who has never ever stayed healthy. If his arm can have a few year grace period after the surgery, I don't think it's out of the question for him to rack up innings, even if you can't count on it. In win now mode, he might be untouchable for me, and in a rebuild, you should net at minimum a Top 100 dynasty asset, and even that could be selling him short. 2025 Projection: 12/2.98/0.97/178 in 140 IP

Cody Bradford - TEX, LHP, 27.1 - Bradford was a victim of low velocity pitchers getting no respect (I am fully guilty of this as well), but low velocity pitchers are starting to get their due more and more, and Bradford is another example of why the discrimination needs to end. The fastball only sat 89.8 MPH, but it was tied for the 21st most valuable 4-seamer in baseball with a +11 Run Value. One of the pitchers he was tied with was Mason Miller and his 100.9 MPH fastball. And Bradford's fastball was better on a per pitch basis than Miller's. Just really fun to think about that disparity in velocity with about the same effectiveness. He combines the plus fastball with an above average changeup that notched a 33.8% whiff%, and he also mixes in a curve, slider, and cutter. He has elite control over the entire arsenal. It resulted in a 3.54 xERA with a 22.7/4.2 K%/BB% in 76.1 IP, and the 3.54 xERA perfectly backs up the surface stats. He gets hit relatively hard with a 8.9% Barrel% against, so I don't think the upside is very high, but nothing he did in 2024 was a fluke either. He looks like a low WHIP, mid rotation fantasy starter. 2025 Projection: 9/3.72/1.15/140 in 150 IP

Hitters

Evan Carter - TEX, OF, 22.7 - Sometimes (or more like the vast majority of the time), general dynasty value and/or general dynasty rankings just isn't a great tool for how you should value players for your actual team. Take Evan Carter, who is certainly moving down rankings after an injured and down season, but if you were banking on him to be a core member of your future lineup, it doesn't make any sense at all to sell low right now. Even if there are real reasons to be worried, like having a bad back. His season ended on May 26th with a stress reaction in his back. It's his 2nd major back injury of his career as he suffered a stress fracture in his back in 2021 which kept him out for most of that season as well. He also didn't hit the ball nearly as hard in 2024 as he did in 2023 with a 86 MPH EV in 45 games. At a projectable 6'2'', 190 pounds, the hope was for him to add more power naturally as he got older, but the constant back injuries complicate that. Is he really going to want to add considerably more weight with a bad back? He also only attempted 2 steals in those 45 games, and again, with the bad back, is is possible he isn't really going to run a ton now? He deserves to take a tumble down the rankings, but back to my original point, it still doesn't make sense to sell low assuming you don't already have a stacked young hitting core. The back might fully heal, and at a still young 22 years old, he is in his prime healing age, so maybe that should be the expectation. The plate approach was still excellent even with the down year with an above average 23.4% whiff% and 18.5% Chase%. Maybe he ends up as more of a solid across the board type than truly impact across the board, but his trade value took such a big hit this year, that even if he doesn't hit his ceiling, you aren't going to get a fair return this year. Carter is a clear hold for me. 2025 Projection: 76/16/67/.249/.335/.410/15 Prime Projection: 91/22/72/.273/.361/.448/20

Josh Jung - TEX, 3B, 27.2 - Jung suffered a broken wrist after getting hit by a pitch just 4 games into the season, and wrist injuries are known to linger and absolutely kill hitters. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened with Jung. He underwent surgery to repair the wrist, and when he returned in late July, he just wasn't the same hitter. He put up a 86.2 MPH EV after notching a 91.8 MPH EV in 2023. It's clear he wasn't healthy, and the Rangers ended up shutting him down in late September. He then got another surgery on the tendon in that wrist in October. I'm pretty scared off by wrist injuries for hitters. It basically ended Alex Kirilloff's career before it could even get off the ground, among others. Like Carter, I don't want to just live in complete fear of an injury, and nobody really knows if it will eventually completely heal, or if this is now going to be a constant problem. And like Carter, I just don't think it makes sense to sell low in cases like this. We've seen what a healthy Jung could do in 2023 (23 homers in 122 games), and while it's anyone's guess if he will be completely healthy in 2025, I would hold on to find out. He's a hold. I would definitely take a star away in OBP leagues though, as he now has 805 MLB PA with a .301 OBP. 2025 Projection: 71/23/78/.253/.307/.445/6

Wyatt Langford – TEX, OF, 23.5 – Langford’s surface stats don’t jump off the page with a .253 BA, .740 OPS, 16 homers, and 19 steals in 134 games, but his underlying skills were jumping off the page all season, and it finally showed in September. He went bonkos to close out the season, slashing .289/.372/.579 with 9 homers, 7 steals, and a 19.0/10.2 K%/BB% in his final 32 games. Even if you pull it back to June 3rd, he had a .804 OPS with 15 homers and 18 steals in his final 98 games. And like I mentioned, the underlying skills are super impressive. He hits the ball very hard with a 9.3% Barrel% and 89.6 MPH EV (91.3 MPH EV in those final 32 games). He lifts it with a 16.6 degree launch, he has elite speed with a 29.8 ft/sec sprint, he has above average contact rates (22.9% whiff% and 20.6% K%), and he has an above average plate approach (23% Chase% with a 9.2% BB%). The cherry on top is that his 74.5 MPH swing is nearly elite, and it’s a short swing too with 7 foot length. That swing speed/length combo is special. Only Heliot Ramos swings a faster bat with a shorter swing. He’s going to explode in 2025. – 2025 Projection: 89/26/93/.274/.352/.481/24

Texas Rangers 2025 Top 10 Dynasty Fantasy Baseball Prospects

1) Sebastian Walcott - TEX, SS, 19.1 - The 6'4'', uber athletic Walcott is the type of special talent where you can watch a few swings of his on Youtube as a 16 year old and immediately fall in love with him, which is exactly what happened when he was my #1 target from his international class. He's then been that rocket ship prospect you hope for, culminating with him putting up a 172 wRC+ at Double-A as an 18 year old ... granted it came in 5 games with a 29.2/4.2 K%/BB%, but I felt it would be more dramatic to leave that part out. And what he did at Double-A was more or less meaningless when he was already over 4 years younger than the average player at High-A, where he slashed .261/.342/.443 with 10 homers, 26 steals, and a 25.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 116 games. It was good for a 123 wRC+. It can be harder to evaluate players when they are so much younger than the level, but there was actually a similarly talented 18 year old at High-A all season with Walcott, Ethan Salas, and Salas put up a 75 wRC+ for comparison. The elite dynasty asset potential is clear with a potentially plus to double plus power/speed combo, but he's not quite there yet. The hit tool is still a risk and the K rates have been high at every stop. He also hasn't fully tapped into his raw power yet with relatively low flyball rates (although he pulls the ball over 50%). I wouldn't quite place him in the truly elite prospect tier, but he's in the one right under that. He's a Top 15 prospect. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 87/28/94/.263/.339/.484/24

2) Kumar Rocker - TEX, RHP, 25.4 - It's been a super bumpy ride, to say the least, but Rocker has inexplicably blasted off into elite pitching prospect status after just 48.1 IP this season. Well, it's not exactly inexplicable, it's explicable because he always had the nasty stuff to get here if he stayed healthy. Can we say pitching 48.1 IP is "staying" healthy? I don't know. But what I do know is that the high octane stuff is elite enough to take on that risk. The 4-seamer sits mid to upper 90's, and while it's not a huge bat missing weapon without tons of vertical break, he also throws a mid to upper 90's sinker which pounds the ball into the dirt. He can start throwing the sinker more, and he can also work on the movement profile of the 4-seamer now that he's healthy. The real money maker is the truly elite slider. It put up a 50% whiff% in 11.2 IP in the majors and a 71.4% whiff% in 10 IP at Triple-A. He rounds out the arsenal with a lesser used changeup, and how good he can get that pitch could be a big factor in just how high the upside will end up. Digging into the nitty gritty of his pitch mix is almost besides the point though, because staying healthy is essentially the only thing he needs to do. The Mets drafted him 10th overall and didn't sign him because they didn't like his medicals. He then underwent shoulder surgery shortly after that, but looked so good in Independent ball when he returned from the surgery, that the Rangers selected him 3rd overall the next year. Which he followed up with Tommy John in 2023, returning for the 2nd half of 2024, where he put up a 1.96 ERA with a 39.6/3.6 K%/BB% in 36.2 IP at mostly AA and AAA. It's about as risky of a health profile as it gets, but all pitchers are so risky, that I don't want to discount him too much because of it. I'll take on extra risk when the upside is a true ace. The downside could be a high leverage reliever though if he keeps getting hurt. 2025 Projection: 9/3.71/1.20/146 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.35/1.13/190 in 160 IP

3) Alejandro Rosario - TEX, RHP, 23.3 - The only box Rosario didn't check in 2024 was upper minors production, and while I do think that is a big step, even for pitchers, you can only dominate the competition that is put in front of you, and Rosario utterly dominated the lower minors. He put up a 2.24 ERA with a 36.9/3.7 K%/BB% in 88.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. He's 6'1'', 182 pounds with an athletic righty delivery that he uses to fire 3 potentially plus or better pitches. The fastball sit's in the mid to upper 90's and it's a bat missing weapon, He combines that with two plus secondaries in his slider and splitter, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out. The control was elite this season. He wasn't nearly this good in college (7.11 ERA with a 11.6% BB% in 74.2 IP his junior year), which is why he fell to 144th overall in the 2023 Draft, but Texas made some changes to his delivery and arsenal, giving reason to buy into the monster breakout. I would still like to see it in the upper minors first, and see him do it for a 2nd straight season in general, before truly valuing as an elite prospect, but if he dominates in his first start or two at Double-A in 2025, he will be a truly elite pitching prospect in the blink of an eye. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 13/3.52/1.18/189 in 170 IP

4) Winston Santos - TEX, RHP, 23.0 - Santos might be one of the more underrated pitching prospects in the minors right now, and he fits squarely into that pitching prospect bucket that I love to shop in. He has big stuff with a plus to double plus mid 90's fastball that misses bats and has a great movement profile. The slider is above average and it plays up because of his good control/command over it. And while he doesn't go to the changeup that often, it flashes as a really good pitch. It all led to a 3.67 ERA with a 30.1/7.4 K%/BB% in 110.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. The ERA spiked to 4.89 at Double-A, but the 3.63 xFIP and 29.5/7.3 K%/BB% shows he got unlucky. As is, he can be a solid #3/4 starter with good K rates and a good WHIP, but if he can develop his changeup more and/or take his control up to double plus levels, he can beat that projection. I like him a ton relative to perceived value. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.81/1.22/175 in 168 IP

5) Jack Leiter - TEX, RHP, 24.11 - We know that pitching development is especially non linear, which makes me want to stay strong on the 2021 2nd overall pick in the draft with plus bloodlines, but damn is Leiter making it hard. He made his MLB debut and got absolutely shellacked, putting up a 8.83 ERA with a 17.9/9.8 K%/BB% in 35.2 IP. He also didn't have the minor league career you would have expected from a talent like this, although he was much better in 2024 than 2023 with a 3.51 ERA and 33.3/10.6 K%/BB% in 77 IP at Triple-A. The below average control is killing him, but there is more than enough here for me to stick to my guns about staying strong. His 96.4 MPH fastball is a bat missing weapon that put up a 32.1% whiff% at AAA and a 28.9% whiff% in the majors. His slider was a whiff machine at AAA with a 43.2% whiff%, but it dropped off in the majors with a 21.8% whiff%. But on the flip side, his lesser used curve and changeup were actually pretty good in the majors. The curve put up a .212 xwOBA with a 38.7% whiff% on 11.4% usage, and the change put up a .237 xwOBA with a 35.7% whiff% on 5.8% usage. The pieces are still here to turn into an impact fantasy starter, and it seemingly should be able to work even with below average control, but so far, it just hasn't come together. We've seen this story a million times from top level talents like Leiter, so while he could easily end up being a bust, I'm not writing him off to that fate yet. He's a hold for me. 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.34/127 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.74/1.26/183 in 170 IP

6) Echedry Vargas - TEX, SS, 20.1 - Vargas has been ripping up rookie ball for the last 2 years, and in his first taste of full season ball, he just kept on producing, slashing .276/.321/.454 with 14 homers, 29 steals, and a 21.1/5.0 K%/BB% in 97 games. It was good for a 125 wRC+. As you can see from that low walk rate, he chases a ton, and it gives him plenty of risk as he climbs the minor league ladder. He also isn't the type to jump off the screen with huge size or eye popping athleticism, but he can hit the ball hard, he can lift it, he can pull it, and he has speed. He's done nothing but produce in his career, and he generally has a good feel to hit. It might not end up the highest upside profile, but he has the potential to be an across the board contributor. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 72/19/77/.252/.317/.426/16

7) Paulino Santana - TEX, OF, 18.4 - Leodalis De Vries, Paulino Santana, and Emil Morales were my top 3 targets from last year's international class, and while De Vries and Morales have gone full blow up, Santana is still sitting in a very reasonable price range. He didn't hit for nearly enough power to be a coveted prospect with 0 homers in 53 games in the DSL, but everything else was there with a 14.6/20.0 K%/BB%, 20 steals, and a 142 wRC+. He's a projectable 6'2'', 180 pounds and he didn't have any major groundball or pull issues with a 35.4% flyball percentage and a 49% Pull%, so the game power should tick up naturally over time as the raw power starts coming in. The super quick and super athletic righty swing that made me fall in love with him is still fully present. The big breakout hasn't come yet, but I still think it's coming down the line. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/20/76/.278/.347/.446/28

8) Emiliano Teodo - TEX, RHP, 24.2 - Teodo is likely a reliever long term with well below average control, but he most certainly has closer stuff, and it seems like he could be a heavy contender to eventually be Texas' closer of the future. And on the off chance he can remain a starter, the strikeout upside is there to make an impact for fantasy. He put up a 1.98 ERA with a 30.7/14.0 K%/BB% in 86.1 IP at Double-A. The fastball sits upper 90's and the slider is double plus. He also has a lesser used changeup that does have some potential. An upper 90's fastball with a wipeout secondary and below average control is a classic back of the bullpen profile to get excited about. If Texas makes the decision to bullpen him, he could end up in the majors before you know it. 2025 Projection: 2/3.88/1.29/32 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.42/1.19/80/32 saves in 65 IP

9) Malcolm Moore - TEX, C, 21.8 - This is a very weak class for catchers, and in shallower leagues, you might want to ignore the catcher position completely in this draft. But in medium to deeper leagues, Moore is your best option if you need a long term catcher. He immediately becomes the best catcher in Texas' system by a long shot, and he could be in the starter mix as soon as 2027 with Jonah Heim hitting free agency after the 2026 season. Texas selected him with the last pick in the first round at 30th overall for his prowess with the bat more than his process behind the plate, which is perfect for fantasy. He's a 6'2'', 215 pound bruiser who has a squared up batting stance that looks more like he's ready the beat the shit out of the pitcher rather than hit a baseball off him. It's kinda intimidating, and he's raked over two years in the Pac 12 with 31 homers and a .958 OPS in 118 games. The plate approach also took a big step forward this year with a 14.3%/18.0% K%/BB%. He's not likely to become a star, but he can become an above average hitting catcher. He didn't have the best pro debut with a 94 wRC+ and 27.9/7.7 K%/BB% in 25 games, but he was thrown right into High-A, and he also jacked 3 dingers, so I have his value as mostly holding steady. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 60/19/71/.247/.319/.433/2

10) Yeremi Cabrera - TEX, OF, 19.9 - Cabrera comes with both hit tool risk and some age to level risk, and he doesn't jump off the screen physically at 5'11'', but what does jump off the screen is his absolutely vicious lefty swing. That thing is made to launch the ball to the moon, and that is exactly what Cabrera did to stateside rookie ball, slashing .301/.348/.571 with 9 homers, 17 steals, and a 20.0/19.0 K%/BB% in 49 games. It was good for a 151 wRC+. He's a bit of a tweener age wise with his birthday smack dab in the middle of baseball season, so while I wouldn't say he was old for the level, he was on the older side, and when he got the call to Single-A, the numbers dropped off hard with 0 homers, a 73 wRC+ and a 29.8% K% in 23 games. It's fair to give him an adjustment period to full season ball, so I don't want to be too hard on him for that. It does underscore the risk in his profile, namely the hit tool risk, but his power/speed combo is legit, and that is what I love to chase in fantasy. He's high risk, high reward. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/21/78/.244/.327/.438/19

18) Dylan Dreiling - TEX, OF, 21.11 - Selected 65th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Dreiling is a proven SEC performer from the second he stepped on campus and is a complete hitter, slashing .342/.459/.715 with 23 homers, 4 steals, and a 20.5%/17.5% K%/BB% in 71 games at Tennessee. He hits the ball hard and he's a disciplined hitter. He's likely a corner outfielder, he's not a huge guy at 5'11'', 197 pounds, the K rate is a bit high, and he doesn't run much, so I'm not sure the upside is super high, but it's a testament to how deep this year's college bat class is that you can get a guy with these kind of numbers this late. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/18/74/.248/.324/.423/7

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Hot Stove season is starting to sneak up on us, and there have already been a few big moves that went down recently. Well, maybe "big moves" is a bit of an exaggeration, but it was a nice appetizer for the main courses yet to come, and who doesn't love a good appetizer. I'll kill off that plate of Mozzarella sticks so fast your head will be spinning. The first one was a trade that we were all expecting last off-season with the Reds trading Jonathan India and Joey Wiemer to Kansas City for Brady Singer. Unfortunately, this hurts both India and Singer's fantasy value as both of them are getting major ballpark downgrades. KC has one of the worst parks for righty homers, and India doesn't have nearly the EV to overcome that. If you want to look for a silver lining, KC was actually the 8th best park for righties overall, and India does have the contact rates to take advantage of that, but at the end of the day, homers are king for fantasy, and this hurts him. He can swap some power for BA, so I wouldn't avoid him, but his value takes a hit. And of course Singer is going to one of the worst pitcher's parks in the league. I was already off Singer this off-season, and this deal will have me completely avoiding him. The positive side of this trade is that it clears up any logjam concerns with Cincinnati. I already had zero concern over Steer and Strand's playing time, and now that take is locked in. Noelvi Marte gets some breathing room too. As for Singer, it seems he might have taken Lowder's spot in the rotation, or possibly Nick Martinez' spot. Chase Burns could be here very soon as well. Injuries and ineffectiveness generally works this stuff out naturally, so I wouldn't change anyone's value because of it, but it definitely creates a squeeze if everyone is healthy.

The 2nd big move of the off-season is Yusei Kikuchi signing a 3 year, $63 million contract with the Angels. We saw the difference a great organization can make to unlocking a players full potential when Kikuchi got traded to Houston, so let's hope he can take some of those lessons with him to a not great organization in the Angels. It's not only development that can help a player's production though, it's pitch calling and just generally being a good team and org. He's going to lose that with the Angels, and I'm definitely a bit less inclined to target him now than I would have been if he went to the Astros or Dodgers. I still think he's a good win now piece though, and would rank him within the Top 200.
