First Baseman get no respect on real life prospects lists for lack of defensive value, but they have the big bats to make a big fantasy impact if they do hit close to their offensive ceilings, and for fantasy, all prospects need to hit pretty close to their offensive ceiling anyway to make a real impact. And quite frankly, playing 1B is harder than they make it out to be. Put some respect on these men's gloves. I'll likely go around 90 deep with the first post dropping tomorrow. See ya then ...
