*Sneak Peek Season rolls on this week as the next Sneak Peek of the 2025 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings is up next on the docket

It just worked out that the release of the Yankees Dynasty Team Report coincided with the gut punch of the Mets signing Juan Soto. Or if you’re a Mets fan, the elation of the Mets stealing Soto away from the Yankees. Steven Cohen gives more George Steinbrenner vibes than the Steinbrenner kids ever did. Hard not to love it. I give more thoughts on the Soto signing in the Dynasty Strategy/Thoughts section below, but first, we dive into the most interesting MLB players on the Yankees and their Top 13 Prospects. Here is the link to the New York Yankees 2025 Dynasty Baseball Team Report (Top 10 Prospects/Interesting MLB guys/Strategy Talk):

Hitters

Anthony Volpe – NYY, SS, 23.11 – Volpe has a well below average 69.5 MPH swing, and I gotta say, it has me shook. Maybe slowing his swing down was all part of the process to improve his hit tool last off-season, and to his credit, his hit tool did improve, going from a .209 BA and 27.8% K% to a .243 BA and 22.6% K%. But that still isn’t a good hit tool, so the tradeoff was not even close to worth it. If he’s going to swing that slow, he needs to make near elite contact, or he needs to be a lift and pull machine, which he was before making this ill fated adjustment. He had a 14.2 degree launch and 45.6% Pull% in 2023, resulting in 21 homers, which he then flipped to a 8.4 degree launch and 32.1% Pull%, resulting in 12 homers. Honestly, whoever was the catalyst for this change of approach needs to answer to this terrible strategy. The one real positive to his 2024 was that he stole 28 bags despite a .293 OBP, so it’s clear he’s going to rack up steals. He obviously can’t be happy with his offensive season, so I’m sure he’s going to go back in the lab this off-season. I wish we had swing speed data from 2023, so we can see if this is just his true talent level, or if he slowed his swing down in 2024 on purpose, but with well below average swing speed like that, and without elite plate skills, his upside is going to be capped. I don’t want to overrate swing speed, and I don’t want to assume he’s locked in here after a one year sample where he changed his swing. I think Volpe will be able to combine the two approaches and become a very good power/speed threat, but I can’t lie, the swing speed scares me a bit, and prevents me from sticking my neck too far out for him. 2025 Projection: 88/18/66/.249/.317/.415/31

Jazz Chisholm – NYY, OF/3B, 27.2 – I ranked Jazz 34th overall on the 2024 Top 1,000, absolutely refusing to fade a player with such a beastly power/speed combo, and named him a major target, writing, “Buy the injury discount. His proven upside is way way way too high to let your fear control you. He was on a 30/30 pace this year. The hit tool isn’t great, but he has 1,193 PA with a .245 BA. That is a large enough sample where I’m not too worried about the bottom falling out. If you want to shy away from mediocre talents due to injury concern, that is fine with me. Even shying away from good talents is reasonable. But you don’t shy away from near elite talents like Chisholm.” And what he just did in 2024 is why you don’t fade this kind of talent. He slashed .256/.324/.436 with 24 homers, 40 steals, and a 24.5/8.5 K%/BB% in 147 games. He was playing well with the Marlins, but he exploded when he got the Yanks with 11 homers, 18 steals and a 132 wRC+ in 46 games. It’s not even that he hit particularly well at Yankee Stadium, it just seemed to light a fire under him, but for sure it’s also a big home field upgrade for him. And the most important thing of all is that he stayed healthy. Health is the main reason why people faded him, and unfortunately, it still has to be taken into account in his price. Staying healthy one season is good, but he needs to go back to back healthy seasons for me to take “injury risk” off his resume, or at least have it downplayed. We saw Robert stay basically healthy in 2023, only to again miss a large chunk of the season in 2024. Jazz could easily follow that same path. If not for injury risk, Jazz has an argument for Top 15 status, so ranking him 27th overall on A Top 75 Sneak Peek of the 2025 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings (Patreon) does factor in a bit of risk. – 2025 Projection: 87/25/84/.252/.323/.455/33

Pitchers

Clarke Schmidt – NYY, RHP, 29.1 – Schmidt is one of my favorite pitcher targets for 2025, and while my favorite pitching targets generally have a low floor (and high upside obviously), Schmidt is one with both a high floor and high upside. A pitcher like that generally gets drafted higher than 217th overall (where he currently sits in NFBC ADP), which is why they don’t land in true target range for me, but Schmidt’s breakout/leveling up has slid just far enough under the radar to land in a perfect target range. He put up a 2.85 ERA with a 26.3/8.5 K%/BB% in 85.1 IP, and while he certainly got lucky with a 3.78 xERA, I think that xERA is underselling him too. Let’s start with the fact he had a 29.4% whiff% overall, which should immediately get your attention. The cutter he added in 2023 has leveled up into a plus pitch with a 32.2% whiff%, which he combines with an above average to plus sweeper (.269 xwOBA with a 29.7% whiff%), and plus to double plus curve (.217 xwOBA with a 33% whiff%). The 94.3 MPH sinker also missed the most bats of it’s career with a 20.3% whiff%. He had about average control last year and he’s had average to above average control in his career, so there are zero issues there. He doesn’t get hit particularly hard either with an above average 5.9% Barrel%. That is just a really, really strong overall skillset, and at the least it should result in a good fantasy starter. At the most, there is legit #2 starter potential in here. Like all pitchers, injuries are a concern, and he did miss over 3 months mid-season with a lat strain. He wasn’t quite as good when he returned in September, so that is probably a major reason his price is a bit depressed, but I’ll just use that as a buying opportunity. 2025 Projection: 13/3.58/1.19/169 in 160 IP

Luis Gil – NYY, RHP, 26.10 – Gil is a tough rank for me. I was never truly in on him as a prospect because of his extreme walk troubles, and even after his excellent rookie season (3.50 ERA with a 26.8% K% in 151.2 IP), there are still a few things holding me back from truly putting him in the young ace, or near ace tier. Most obviously, the control is still really bad with a terrible 12.1% BB%, and he was a very hot or cold pitcher because of it. I would be willing to overlook that (or at least be more forgiving of it), if he had a true dominant secondary, but he doesn’t really have that with a slider that put up a good but not great .280 xwOBA and 31.5% whiff%, and a changeup that put up a solid .307 xwOBA and 26.9% whiff%. The money maker is of course the 96.6 MPH fastball that is a plus pitch with a .318 xwOBA and 28.5% whiff%. He put up a 29% whiff% overall, which is in the double plus range. I definitely feel the pull to bet on the huge stuff and whiff rates, but the well below average control, and the lack of a true whiff machine secondary makes it all feel very shaky to me. He currently has a 182 NFBC ADP, which feels about right to me, so he seems to be valued with how I see him as well. He’s a Top 150-ish dynasty asset. 2025 Projection: 12/3.69/1.22/181 in 160 IP

Bullpen

Luke Weaver – NYY, Closer, 31.7 – With the Yankees now scrambling to replace Soto’s offensive production, it seems likely that the focus isn’t going to be on the bullpen (of course you never know though), so that leaves Weaver as the heavy favorite to remain the Yanks closer in 2025. And he certainly deserves that job after a breakout 2024, putting up a 2.89 ERA with a 31.1/7.9 K%/BB% in 84 IP. The 95.7 MPH fastball was double plus with a +8 run value and 30% whiff%. The changeup was elite with a .216 xwOBA and 48% whiff%. And he throws a solid cutter too. The Yanks saw qualities they thought they could work with when they acquired him in 2023, and boy oh boy did it work with his stuff taking a huge step forward. The move from a starter to the bullpen also probably naturally played a role. Those very real adjustments give hope that this is mostly sustainable, and not a one year blip. We know how volatile relief pitching can be, but I’m apt to buy the breakout. 2025 Projection 4/3.36/1.11/79/33 saves in 67 IP

New York Yankees 2025 Top 10 Dynasty Fantasy Baseball Prospects Rankings

1) Jasson Dominguez – NYY, OF, 22.2 – The Yankees didn’t want to unleash Dominguez in the majors this year, and his .617 OPS in the 67 PA he did receive isn’t super impressive, but make no mistake, Dominguez is still on the superstar path. His 75.4 MPH swing is straight elite, which proves right there that his talent really wasn’t that overhyped as an international prospect. His 23.4% whiff% was comfortably above average, which is pretty huge to see, and his 28.1% Chase% was slightly above average. Tack on plus speed, and Dominguez’ beastly potential was even able to shine through despite the Yanks refusing to unleash him. And oh yea, he destroyed the upper minors immediately after returning from Tommy John surgery in mid May with a 135 wRC+, 11 homers, 16 steals (in 17 attempts) and a 20.0/8.8 K%/BB% in 58 games. Is he really 22 years old and not like 26 years old? Beats me. But I don’t care when it comes to a talent this huge (I gave my thoughts on MLB cracking down on players’ lying about their ages in the Philadelphia Phillies Dynasty Team Report). I see no reason why the Yanks won’t unleash him immediately in 2025, and he could be on a beeline for elite dynasty asset status in short order. Go after him. He ranked 45th overall on the Top 75 Sneak Peek of the 2025 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings over on the Patreon (more Sneak Peeks are coming this week). – 2025 Projection: 83/21/76/.246/.323/.434/26 Prime Projection: 109/28/91/.266/.351/.487/34

2) Spencer Jones – NYY, OF, 23.11 – Extremely high strikeout rate hitters often straddle that imaginary line between “he’ll hit enough for the huge talent to blow up” and “he can’t hit, making the huge talent worthless.” It often results in a very black or white ranking, because if you think they will hit enough, they get ranked extremely high, and if you don’t think they will hit enough, you might erase them completely from your rankings. I like to live in the Grey (not Grey as in Razzball Grey, that would just be odd, but Grey as in the Queen’s English of gray), so while I’m obviously less than enthused with Jones’ 36.8% K% in 122 games at Double-A, I don’t want to just banish him to purgatory. His talent is just too huge to do that at 6’6”, 235 pounds with an at least plus power/speed combo. And even with all of the strikeouts, he still showed out in the upper minors with 17 homers, 25 steals, and a 124 wRC+. He doesn’t have to bring the K rate down to like the mid 20’s, he can survive in the low 30’s. Jones isn’t Elly, but we saw the season Elly just put up with a 31.3% K%. The extremely high K rate rate definitely hurts his value (at least he’s no Elijah Green and his 44% K%), but I don’t think it means you should write him off. The upside is too high, and I don’t think the hit tool is hopeless. He’s still a Top 75 Prospect for me. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.217/.290/.399/4 Prime Projection: 75/21/79/.238/.317/.436/21

3) Roderick Arias – NYY, SS, 20.7 – Arias was one of the top bets to go full elite prospect status in 2024, and it’s good reminder that even though it can feel like a rookie ball prospect is inevitable, they aren’t actually inevitable. There is a lot of inherent risk if you haven’t even hit full season ball yet. Arias struggled to adjust for the first 3+ months of the season with a .652 OPS and 34.9% K%, but he finally found his groove in the final 2 months, giving hope that the big prospect breakout can still happen in 2025. In his final 47 games he slashed .276/.390/.471 with 7 homers, 16 steals, and a 24.4/14.6 K%/BB%. The strikeout rate has been high throughout his career, so there is definitely hit tool risk here, but he hits the ball hard, he has speed and he gets on base. I don’t think it’s fair to expect a truly elite prospect breakout anymore. You are really aiming for those rocket ships with little to no bumps in the road, and that isn’t quite Arias. But just because his stock took a hit, doesn’t mean he’s not a really talented prospect. Just more of a Top 100-150 one. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/77/.247/.326/.442/23

4) George Lombard – NYY, SS, 19.10 – Lombard’s hit tool was not as good as hoped in his first full year of pro ball with a 24% K% and .232 BA in 81 games at Single-A, and then a 19.8% K% and .226 BA in 29 games at High-A. A large chunk of his value was coming from that hit tool, because he doesn’t have big present power with only 5 homers in 110 games. The launch and approach are geared more for line drives than homers, so it’s not just about gaining more power naturally, which he will. He has good tools at 6’3”, 190 pounds and there is definitely room to tack on more mass. He’s also fast and a good baserunner with 39 steals. He has a mature approach (12.3% BB% with a .338 OBP), he’s a good defensive SS, and he’s young for his class at a still 19 years old as of 2025 Opening Day. There is potential for him to be an above average across the board player at peak, but he’s going to have to show real hit tool gains pretty soon, or a major power increase if he doesn’t want the profile to start looking a bit lackluster. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/17/69/.259/.324/.419/23

5) Everson Pereira – NYY, OF, 24.0 – Pereira’s season ended on May 19th after undergoing elbow surgery. He was doing his usual big power, big strikeout thing before going down with the injury with 10 homers and a 32.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 40 games at Triple-A. That K rate at Triple-A is scary, and it was even worse when he got a shot in the majors in 2023 with a 38.8% K% and 43.1% whiff%. But strikeouts aside, Pereira is an exciting talent with the ability to crush the ball and above average speed. He’s basically obliterated every stop of the minors. These guys generally get a shot at some point in time, often with the Miami Marlins of the world, and the fantasy upside is worth staying patient with. With Juan Soto now officially a goner, maybe Pereira’s status in the Yankees organization gets a little bump, and even if he isn’t handed a starting job (which he won’t be), he might hang around in that next man up territory. He’s a bit more interesting to me now than he was before Soto signing with the Mets. 2025 Projection: 28/10/35/.222/.291/.424/5 Prime Projection: 71/24/78/.235/.312/.454/12

6) Chase Hampton – NYY, RHP, 23.8 – Hampton didn’t make his season debut until July 1st due to an elbow injury. When he returned, his stuff was diminished and the results were poor with a 21.1/11.8 K%/BB% in 18.2 IP. He then went right back on the IL with a lower body injury that ended his season. Pitching prospects are fun ;). At full health, he’s 6’2, 200 pounds with mid 90’s heat, a diverse set of secondaries (slider, curve, cutter, change), and solid control/command. He looked like he had the potential to be an impact mid-rotation fantasy starter, and if he returns to full health in 2025, he still has that potential. But the risk couldn’t be more evident. 2025 Projection: 2/4.38/1.37/21 in 25 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.91/1.30/157 in 155 IP

7) Ben Hess – NYY, RHP, 21.10 – Selected 26th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Hess is a high floor real life arm at 6’5”, 255 pounds with a mid 90’s fastball and 3 legit secondaries in his slider, curve and changeup. He didn’t pitch particularly well this year with a 5.80 ERA and 1.39 WHIP in 68.1 IP in the SEC, but the 34.8%/11.5% K%/BB% looks much better. I call him a “high floor real life arm” because as a college starter with his size, velocity and pitch mix, there is a very high probability he will be a major league arm in some capacity. But for fantasy, there is risk he ends up in the bullpen, or a back end starter if his control can’t improve. I’m apt to bet on the size and stuff here, and his price should be very reasonable in First Year Players Drafts. Hess ranked 28th overall on the End of Season Top 56 2025 First Year Player Draft Rankings (Full off-season Top 100+ coming soon on the Patreon). – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.95/1.32/165 in 160 IP

8) Edgleen Perez – NYY, C, 18.10 – Perez isn’t my typical big game power upside catcher that I like to go after, especially if you’re in rookie ball, but his supporting skills are good enough to get excited. His plate skills are elite for his age with a 16.2/20.8 K%/BB%, and it resulted in a 138 wRC+ in 51 games at stateside rookie ball. It only came with 2 homers due to a 51.7% GB%, but he hits the ball hard, so there is more game power in the tank if he can raise his launch. And he has a chance to be a good defensive catcher, so his glove could get his bat in the lineup. He ranked 62nd overall in my Top 78 2025 Dynasty Baseball Catcher Rankings (Patreon). – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/15/68/.276/.343/.430/3

9) Rafael Flores – NYY, C/1B, 24.5 – Flores’ power took a big step forward in 2024, and it resulted in him destroying Double-A, slashing .274/.359/.519 with 15 homers, 6 steals, and a 26.7/10.3 K%/BB% in 65 games. He also so easily passes the eye test at 6’3”, 220 pounds with a smooth righty swing that looks like an MLB swing. I mean, his offensive power upside is no joke. He’s already 24 years old, the hit tool has risk as you can see from that strikeout rate, and he’s not a particularly good defensive player, but it’s so easy to fall in love watching his swing. I like him, but a bench bat is probably his most reasonable outcome. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/18/65/.241/.317/.437/3

10) Henry Lalane – NYY, LHP, 20.10 – Lalane was a fun breakout pick before the season, but he was limited to just 12.1 IP due to shoulder fatigue. It was a completely lost season. This is just the life of a pitching prospect, and it’s why rookie ball pitchers are some of my least favorite prospects to go after. There is just so much that can go wrong. But when you play the rookie ball pitcher game, you know what you are getting into, so the hope is that he can come back completely healthy in 2025 and immediately get the hype rolling again. Here was my blurb for him in the 2024 Top 1,000, and nothing has really changed assuming full health: “Rookie ball pitchers aren’t my favorite to go after, but if you are going to go after one, a 6’7”, 211 pound lefty with good stuff and good numbers isn’t a bad choice. Lalane put up a 36.6%/4.5% K%/BB% in 21.2 IP in stateside rookie ball with 3 potentially plus pitches (fastball, breaking ball, changeup). He only reached 4 IP in one outing, and the fastball sits in the low to mid 90’s, so there is a long way to go, but if you squint hard enough, you can see a CC Sabathia starter pack here. Here’s to hoping he can pack on 130 pounds of pure Captain Crunch to fulfill his destiny.” ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/165 in 160 IP

11) Caleb Durbin – NYY, 2B/3B, 25.1 – I see the huge offensive season Durbin just had at Triple-A, slashing .287/.396/.471 with 10 homers, 29 steals, and a 9.9/12.5 K%/BB% in 82 games (he was even better in the AFL with a .976 OPS in 24 games), but I’m struggling to get past the extremely low 83 MPH EV. He’s only 5’6”, he’s already 25 years old (as of 2025 Opening Day), and while he has a solid infield glove, he’s not some slick fielding SS whose glove will get him on the field. It seems like a utility infielder profile to me, especially if he remains on the Yankees. On the other hand, his contact/speed combo gives him a very clear path to fantasy usefulness if he does work his way into the lineup, or if he gets traded to a team with more opportunity. He can also lift and pull it, which we know can overcome a low EV, but an 83 MPH EV isn’t just low, it’s among the worst in baseball low. I know Durbin has his big supporters, and while I’m not one of them, I understand what they see with contact, speed, lift, pull, and proximity. I don’t mind him as a proximity play, but he’s not really one of my guys. 2025 Projection: 29/4/18/.250/.313/.360/9 Prime Projection: 76/10/58/.271/.325/.383/26

12) Will Warren – NYY, RHP, 25.2 – Warren put up a 10.32 ERA in his 22.2 IP MLB debut, which is hard to find silver linings with, but let’s try to find a few. The 4.52 xERA and 26.4/9.1 K%/BB% look much better, and his pitches were missing bats. His 93.8 MPH 4-seamer actually performed excellently with a 24.6% whiff% and .255 xwOBA. His famed sweeper wasn’t great, but it still put up a 37.1% whiff%, which tells me better day are ahead, and the underlying numbers on the changeup were really good with a .221 xwOBA and 32% whiff%. Both the changeup and sweeper got massively unlucky, which was the main culprit for the ridiculous ERA. He also throws a sinker and cutter, giving him a diverse pitch mix. He wasn’t good at Triple-A either with a 5.91 ERA in 109.2 IP, but again, the 28.0/8.0 K%/BB% looked much better. He’s probably a back end starter, but I don’t think his 2024 was as bad as it seemed on the surface. Looking at the underlying metrics of the individual pitches actually paints a kinda encouraging picture. He’s only a deeper league play right now, but I would hold him in those leagues. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/51 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.32/153 in 150 IP

13) Bryce Cunningham – NYY, RHP, 22.3 – Selected 53rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Cunningham is a built up 6’5”, 230 pounds with the big mid 90’s fastball to match. He combines the heat with a slider and changeup that can both miss bats, giving him 3 legit pitches with bat missing ability. There is a reason the Yanks selected him relatively high despite pretty lackluster college production. He has a career 4.95 ERA in 160 IP in the SEC, and while 2024 was his best season, it wasn’t exactly dominant with a 4.36 ERA and 26.6/9.4 K%/BB% in 84.2 IP. The stuff gives him a high real life floor as a potentially impact reliever, and there is rotation upside too if he can improve his control/command and continue to refine his pitch arsenal. He’s not the worst option if you are looking for a college arm in the mid to late rounds of your First Year Player Draft, but he’s not exactly a target for me either. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/4.22/1.33/146 in 150 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

The real life implications of Soto signing a 15 year, $765 million contract are obviously the most fun thing to discuss right now, but because I’m a dynasty baseball nut, I’m actually a bit more interested in the fantasy fallout. The first little piece of fantasy fallout is that Soto actually changed his approach for the Yankee Stadium short porch. He put up a career high by far 45.1% Pull%, and it led to a career high 41 homers. The Yanks were the 3rd best park for lefty homers last year, while the Mets were 10th worst. Will Soto continue to pull the ball that much? Or will he decide to go back to his career norms which sat more in the high 30 percent area? He’s certainly ballpark proof with a 99.5 MPH FB/LD EV, but it’s easy to forget that there was actually a small time where people were worried about his fantasy upside with a 29 homer and 27 homer season in 2021-22. Yankee Stadium was perfect for him. Citi Field isn’t. My guess is that he continues to pull the ball more, and because of the extreme EV, I’m not worried about the ballpark downgrade, but I think it’s worth mentioning.

The next most interesting fantasy fallout is how this signing impacts the playing time projections for exciting youngsters hoping for a shot to break into the bigs. I already wasn’t too worried about Dominguez’ playing time, and now that seems even more locked in. Ben Rice on the other hand, who I was hoping could make it through the off-season with a shot to win the Yanks 1B job, I am now much less confident in. It sure feels like Pete Alonso is now an obvious pivot for the Yankees. But if not him, Christian Walker, or even Paul Goldschmidt could be an option. Without Soto, I just don’t see the Yanks leaving 1B open anymore. Other than Dominguez, Everson Pereira and Spencer Jones sure seem to take on much more importance for the Yanks long term outfield plans. Even if they sign an outfielder, it will be an older vet. As for the Mets, Brett Baty gets a lot more attractive with Mark Vientos likely to slide over to 1B. He’s struggled in his first 3 tastes of the majors, but I still think he can fulfill his better in real life than fantasy destiny if given a long enough leash, and he just may get that leash in 2025.

This is all obviously still speculation with many more moves to come for both franchises, but opportunity and leash is one of the most important things for young players trying to break in, and this seems to shift which young players are in a better position to get their shot now, and which might be left holding the bag. Stay tuned.
