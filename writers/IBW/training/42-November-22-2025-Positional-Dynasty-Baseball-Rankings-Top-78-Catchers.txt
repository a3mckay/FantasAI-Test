2025 Positional Dynasty Baseball Rankings: Top 78 Catchers

New
Nov 22, 2024

The Dynasty Baseball Positional Rankings have arrived, and we kick off the festivities with catchers. Nobody wants to pay up for one, but when you are getting terrible production during the season, you start to maybe question that strategy a bit (I know I have in my 18 teamer). I run through everyone from the elite studs, to the diamonds in the rough, to even just down to the rough in the rough at the very back of the rankings. Even 30 teamers need some love. Here is the 2025 Positional Dynasty Baseball Rankings: Top 78 Catchers:

Tier 1

1) William Contreras - MIL, C, 27.3 - Contreras is coming off back to back seasons finishing as the #1 catcher in fantasy. He's smack dab in the middle of his prime at 27 years old. There isn't much of an argument for anybody else to hold down the #1 dynasty catcher in the game spot. He smashes the ball with a career high 92.8 MPH EV that is in the top 6% of the league, and his 118.1 MPH Max EV was the 4th hardest hit ball all season. He has a good feel to hit and a plus plate approach (20.5/11.5 K%/BB%). And he also nabbed 9 bags this year, which is a really, really nice little bonus to get from your catcher. The only quibble with his profile is that he hits it on the ground a lot with a 54.5% GB%, which definitely limits his homer upside, but he hits the ball hard enough where he can still hit plenty of dingers, as evidenced by him knocking out 23 this year. - 2025 Projection: 88/22/84/.279/.360/.460/6

2) Adley Rutschman - BAL, C, 27.2 - It was announced that Baltimore is moving the left field fences back in after moving them out and making them taller before the 2022 season. Gotta love baseball where teams can just be like, yea, we are going to make our field smaller, or bigger, or whatever they hell they want. How fun if in football teams can just be like, so we're going to make out homefield 150 yards next year. Or 75 yards. Or if in basketball they can just make the rim 11 feet high. It's genuinely a cool thing that everything isn't so cookie cutter. And I respect Baltimore for realizing they overcorrected their fences originally and figuring out a happy medium. The Orioles had the 9th worst park for righty homers in 2024, so hopefully that number rises closer to the middle of the pack or higher. And with Adley Rutschman being a switch hitter who put up an 18.8 degree launch with a 42.1% Pull%, this is only going to help his lackluster homer totals. This is a nice bump for his fantasy value, which was starting to get quite boring. He hit .250 with 19 homers and 1 steal in 148 games. His OBP league owners were upset too with his 9.1% BB% (13.4% in 2023) and .318 OBP. He makes a ton of contact (17.1% whiff%), but he does it with a slow swing (69 MPH which is well below average), so he really hasn't done a ton of damage with an almost dead average Barrel% in his career. Moving the fences in is perfect for him, and while it might not be an explosion, 23 homers would be better than 19, along with the added BA, RBI and Runs that come with it. Everything seems setup for him to have a relatively big age 27 year old season. - 2025 Projection: 76/23/83/.265/.341/.445/2

3) Yainer Diaz - HOU, C, 26.7 - Diaz' launch went in the wrong direction in 2024, dropping from 11.5 to 8.5 degrees, and it tanked his Barrel% from 12.2% to 7.6%. He went from hitting 23 homers with a .538 SLG to 16 homers with a .441 SLG. He still hit the ball tremendously hard with a 90.2/94.5 MPH AVG/FB EV, and his contact rates hit a career best with a 17.3% K%, so he was still an excellent offense player, finishing as the 4th best catcher in fantasy. Lowering the launch and improving the contact rates also resulted in a career best .299 BA with a .295 xBA to back it up. He's a really good offensive catcher no matter where the launch lands, but for fantasy, it would be nice if he could bring that back up to 2023 levels, or even higher. He has a terrible plate approach with a 3.9% BB% and 42.6% Chase%, so certainly take a star away here for OBP leagues, but he's clearly proven he can make the profile work while he's in his physical prime. - 2025 Projection: 71/19/85/.287/.319/.461/1

Tier 2

4) Samuel Basallo - BAL, C/1B, 20.7 - Basallo didn't quite obliterate the upper minors like he did the lower minors, slashing .278/.341/.449 with 19 homers, 10 steals, and a 21.1/8.6 K%/BB% in 127 games, but when you take into account that he was 19 years old for the vast majority of the season, it gets a lot more impressive. He was also much better at Double-A with a 134 wRC+ in 106 games than he was at Triple-A (62 wRC+ with a 31.4% K% in 21 games), so I think we can give him a pass for an adjustment period with a new team, coaches, teammates, league, home park etc ... Even at Triple-A, the sweet lefty swinging, 6'4'' Basallo put up a 91.1 MPH EV. He's always put up solid contact rates in the minors, but the spike at Triple-A could also be an indicator that we shouldn't expect the highest BA at least early in his career. He puts the ball on the ground a decent amount, but with his type of double plus power, he's launch proof. I don't know where he fits in defensively with Adley behind the plate, and plenty of competition at 1B (Mayo and Mountcastle), but long term there seems to be plenty of room for all of them. He's a special power bat. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/35/.241/.300/.430/2 Prime Projection: 84/30/97/.268/.337/.505/6

5) Francisco Alvarez - NYM, C, 23.4 - Alvarez just went through an almost textbook sophomore slump season. He followed up his 25 homer rookie year in 123 games with a disappointing sophomore campaign, jacking out only 11 in 113 games, including the playoffs. The underlying stats back up the mediocre numbers with a 12.8% Barrel% in 2023 vs. a 6.7% in 2024, but the sophomore slump isn't about getting unlucky, it's about the game of adjustments. And even with the down power year, he actually put up a better wRC+ this year (102) than he did last year (97), so it was also about Alvarez working on becoming a more complete hitter himself. This is just the normal ebb and flow of a young player's career, and with Alvarez going through those growing pains as a 21-22 year old on the major league level, I'm not even the slightest bit concerned. His power can't be held down for long with a 114.8 MPH Max EV which was in the top 5% of the league, and his 88.8/94.2 MPH AVG/FB EV was still really good. He also made some incremental improvements to the contact rates, bringing the whiff% under 30% to 29.6%, to go along with a his solid 28.9% Chase%. Alvarez is still right on track to be one of the top hitting catchers in the game for the next decade. I'm smelling a big year 3 where he really puts it all together. - 2025 Projection: 68/25/82/.246/.323/.458/2

6) Cal Raleigh - SEA, C, 28.4 - Raleigh's 34 homers were a career high and was the top mark amongst catchers by a comfortable margin (Langeliers was 2nd with 29). His double plus 74.5 MPH swing and 21.2 degree launch shows he's not going to stop ripping dingers anytime soon, but it also shows he's not going to hit for a high BA anytime soon either. He hit .220 in 2024 and has a career .218 BA. You know exactly what you are getting with Raleigh. Extreme power with an extremely low BA. For OBP leagues, his 11.1% BB% was a career best, and while he's not going to be an asset in OBP, his .312 OBP at least won't tank you. He also stole a career high 6 bags (1 was his previous career), which is a nice little tack on. He was the 2nd best catcher in fantasy in 2024, and there is no reason he shouldn't be right up there again in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 72/31/90/.224/.310/.448/3

7) Will Smith - LAD, C, 30.0 - Smith always feels so underwhelming for fantasy, and now that we see he swings a double below average bat with a 67.9 MPH swing, it just feels like seeing that missing puzzle piece for it to all make sense now. The 10.8% Barrel% is excellent, and so is the 89.4 MPH EV, 18.7 degree launch and 19.3/9.4 K%/BB%, but that slow swing is just going to tamper down that upside. His career low by a decent margin 33.9% Pull% (37.7% in 2023) is also going to tamper down that fantasy upside. And at 30 years old, he's officially old for dynasty, especially for a catcher. There is certainly potential for everything to fall right and for him to have that big year, but I'm no longer waiting for it. He's a good fantasy catcher, but not a great one. - 2025 Projection: 75/23/75/.255/.342/.449/2

Tier 3

8) Logan O’Hoppe - LAA, C, 25.2 - O'Hoppe was unsurprisingly not able to keep up his insane homer pace from 2023, but he locked himself in as a legit power hitter with 20 homers, a 12% Barrel%, 90.4/95.4 MPH AVG/FB EV and a 15.3 degree launch in 136 games. Unfortunately, he also locked in that he isn't going to hit for a high average or OBP with a 29.7/6.3 K%/BB%, backed up by a 33.6% whiff% and 34% Chase%. I'm betting on him being able to improve the hit tool and plate approach somewhat as he gains more experience (remember that it can take catchers longer to develop offensively with how much focus they put on defense/pitching), which could set him up for some big seasons considering those underlying power metrics. The little thorn is that Travis d'Arnaud just signed a 2 year deal, which is almost certainly going to cut into O'Hoppe's playing time. - 2025 Projection: 66/24/75/.249/.317/.446/2

9) Willson Contreras - STL, C, 32.11 - It was announced that Contreras will be moved to 1B, so you are on a one year notice to figure out your catcher spot for 2026 and beyond if you own Contreras. Maybe that plan can entail going over his replacement, Ivan Herrera, but we'll get to him later. The good news is that you should at the least get a boost in playing time at your catcher position for 2025, and maybe even a production boost without him having to take a beating behind the plate. He also has the bat to profile at 1B with his 3rd straight season of putting up an xwOBA that was in the top 7% of baseball (.365 xwOBA in 2024). His 75.9 MPH swing is elite, just to give you another idea of how legit his bat is, and he crushes the ball with a 91.6 MPH EV and 11.2% Barrel%. The only negative of his profile is that he swings and misses a lot with a 35% whiff%, and while that is a career worst, it's really not far off at all from his career norms, so I wouldn't be worried about his BA (career .258 BA). He's getting up there in age, but for 2025, he has a shot to outdo his younger brother for the top fantasy catcher in the game. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/86/.255/.350/.470/5

10) Shea Langeliers - OAK, C, 27.5 - Langeliers' 29 homers was 2nd in baseball for catchers behind only Cal Raleigh, and he's about to get a major ballpark upgrade in 2025. He will certainly compete at the top of that category again because he absolutely smashes the ball with a 91.3/95.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, and he launches it with a 16.3 degree launch. It's going to come with a low batting average (27.2/7.7 K%/BB%), but that is just the game with the vast majority of catchers. He's a perfect example of it taking catchers a bit longer to develop offensively after getting taken 9th overall in 2019, but he's arrived. - 2025 Projection: 64/26/78/.237/.306/.447/3

Tier 4 

11) Dalton Rushing - LAD, C/OF, 24.1 - I don't know if Rushing is going to stick at catcher, or if he can at least play enough games there per season to retain catcher eligibility, but I do know that it's not something you can count on as you are planning the future of your dynasty team. If he does retain eligibility for any extended period of time, consider it gravy, but make sure you aren't banking on him to be your guy for the next several seasons. And with how good his bat can be in that LA lineup, you might be better off for him not to stick at catcher. He proved himself in the upper minors in 2024, slashing .271/.385/.512 with 26 homers, 2 steals, and a 20.5/12.7 K%/BB% in 114 games split between Double-A (149 wRC+) and Triple-A (128 wRC+). He has easy plus power with a 90.8 MPH EV, he has a launch made for both power and average, and he has a plus plate approach. The hit tool is solid, but I can see that dipping to below average against major league pitching, and if he's playing corner outfield, he is going to have to mash. We have seen LA be very quick with the hook if young players aren't producing. I like the bat a ton, but there are enough little things to make me hesitant to really value him at a premium. A Top 100-150 dynasty asset is a reasonable projection for him at peak if things work out. He should compete for at bats early into 2025, but he is going to have to earn it every step of the way. - 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.242/.310/.428/1 Prime Projection: 82/26/88/.262/.339/.471/2

12) Ivan Herrera - STL, C, 24.10 - With Willson Contreras moving to 1B, Herrera is taking over as St. Louis' starting catcher, and he has the potential to be a truly impact fantasy catcher with hit, power, and stolen bases in his arsenal. He's coming off a rookie year where he put up a 127 wRC+ with a .366 xwOBA in 72 games. That xwOBA led all catchers. Leading all catchers in xwOBA in your rookie year is damn exciting. He does everything offensively with a 9% Barrel%, 89.3 MPH EV, 9.2 degree launch and a 20.5/9.7 K%/BB%. His 73.3 MPH swing is easily plus, giving him a pretty potent swing speed/contact combo. His 27.3 ft/sec sprint is about average, and he's started to run more with 11 steals in 83 games at Triple-A in 2023, and now 8 steals in 99 games split between Triple-A and the majors this year. Chipping in like that helps when other catchers might get you 0-2 steals. His launch isn't conducive to big homer totals, but he definitely has the potential to hit much more than he hit this year, and if you want a catcher who doesn't tank your BA, Herrera is your man. He's my top catcher target for dynasty. - 2025 Projection: 72/15/66/.271/.340/.428/7

13) J.T. Realmuto - PHI, C, 34.0 - Realmuto battled a sore knee basically all season and it limited him to 99 games. It's likely why he stole just 2 bags in 4 attempts. Without stolen bases, his profile gets a lot more pedestrian, and while his 28.4 ft/sec sprint speed was still high, it seems like wishful thinking to count on him continuing to steal a considerable amount of bags as he enters his mid 30's. He hits the ball hard enough with a 89.2/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV to have plenty of value without the steals, but it definitely lops off some upside off the top. And we also have to start taking age related decline into account. I still think he's a very good win now catcher, but his dynasty value is definitely on the decline. - 2025 Projection: 73/21/75/.265/.328/.443/9

14) Salvador Perez - KCR, C/1B, 34.11 - I keep trying to predict Perez' decline, and he keeps chugging along just fine, finishing as the 3rd best catcher in fantasy in 2024. As usual, he ripped dingers with 27 homers, a 91.1 MPH EV, and 19.0 degree launch. He also managed to actually improve his plate approach with a 6 year best 19.8% K% and career best 6.7% BB%. He still chases a ton with a 42.9% Chase%, but a 73.2 MPH swing is firmly plus, so the cliff ain't here yet. Father time is obviously undefeated, so the decline will come soon, but it sure seems like he has some more good seasons in him yet. I just still feel hesitant to be the one left holding the bag when it does happen. - 2025 Projection: 59/26/83/.258/.307/.451/0

15) Moises Ballesteros - CHC, C, 21.5 - Ballesteros is a below average defensive catcher which makes it unclear if he will end up sticking behind the plate. He's only 21 years old, so maybe he'll improve, and maybe Chicago will be fine with his below average defense because they are not strong at catcher in both the majors and the minors. Even if Ballesteros moves off catcher to 1B/DH, he definitely has the bat to clear that high bar. He posses one of the best hit/power combos in the minors, slashing .289/.354/.471 with 19 homers, 1 steal, and a 18.3/8.9 K%/BB% in 124 games split between Double-A (154 wRC+) and Triple-A (106 wRC+). And keep in mind he did that as a 20 year old. He started to lift and pull the ball more at Triple-A, which spiked his K rate a bit, but we'll take that tradeoff for more dingers. Lack of defensive value can certainly end up a real issue if his bat ends up more above average than great, but Chicago has every incentive for him to stick behind the plate, so I'm leaning he gets a real shot there. - 2025 Projection: 33/9/39/.258/.307/.420/1 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.275/.332/.450/2

16) Tyler Stephenson - CIN, C, 28.8 - The 6'4'', 225 pound Stephenson was the former 11th overall pick in the 2015 Draft, and he finally had that power breakout that I feel we've been waiting for forever, jacking a career high by far 19 homers in 138 games. It also came with a career high 90.2/95.2 MPH AVG/FB EV to back up the surface stats. He's always had a good hit tool and plate approach (22.7/9.3 K%/BB%), so the power uptick was all he needed. I've said it a few times in these rankings, but catchers taking longer to breakout offensively is the norm, so I do think he can maintain this level over the next few seasons. He finished as the 8th overall catcher in 2024, and it sure seems like that could be on the rise in future years. - 2025 Projection: 71/19/69/.261/.335/.434/1

17) Austin Wells - NYY, C, 25.9 - Let's start with the fact that Wells was an excellent defensive catcher, ranking 5th best in baseball according to Fangraphs. His defense was a question coming up in the system, so seeing that is a big deal for his ability to stick at catcher, which is now a foregone conclusion. But it's offense we care the most about, and while Wells didn't exactly dominate with a .229 BA and 13 homers in 115 games, there are plenty of positive takeaways. It was his rookie year and he put up an above average 105 wRC+. That is a really strong foundation, and he also underperformed his underlying numbers with a .339 xwOBA vs. .315 wOBA. He hit the ball hard enough with a 88.4 MPH EV, he lifted it with a 17.1 degree launch, and he showed strong plate skills with a 21.0/11.4 K%/BB%. With the short porch at Yankees Stadium, that is just begging for some big homer totals in future years. Wells is setting up to be a really good fantasy catcher for a long time. - 2025 Projection: 63/20/71/.243/.336/.440/3

18) Gabriel Moreno - ARI, C, 25.2 - I was always low on Moreno and didn't buy the playoff homer binge, and that proved correct as he had a very lackluster fantasy season. He hit .266 with just 5 homers in 97 games. He put up a 107 wRC+ on the back of an excellent 14.8/11.7 K%/BB%, and he's a good defensive player, so there is a reason he was ranked highly on real lift prospect lists, but for fantasy, I just didn't see that next level appeal. It's not like I hated him, and I still don't hate him now. He hits the ball hard with a 90 MPH EV, but even with a career high 8.8 degree launch, a 92.7 MPH FB/LD EV is just not going to result in a bunch of homers. He should be a good fantasy catcher for a long time, but he's not likely to be a next level one. - 2025 Projection: 58/13/66/.278/.346/.415/6

19) Ryan Jeffers - MIN, C, 27.10 - Jeffers robbed Peter to pay Paul in 2024, bringing his K rate down to a career best by far 20.2% (27.8% in 2023), but his exit velocity tanked with it to a career low by far 86.9 MPH (90.5 MPH in 2024). His walk rate tanked too with a 6.9% BB% (9.9% in 2023). With how much he hits the ball in the air (16.9 degree launch), he couldn't even take advantage of the better contact rates with a .226 BA and 21 homers in 122 games. It's interesting that he kinda ended up with the same numbers he likely would have ended up with anyway had he just kept the same profile from 2023, except with a lower OBP. All roads seem to lead to mostly the same place for Jeffers. Which is as a low BA slugger. - 2025 Projection: 63/23/72/.240/.316/.440/3

20) Sean Murphy - ATL, C, 30.6 - Murphy missed two month right at the beginning of the season with an oblique injury, and it's an easy thing to point to for what led to a down season. He put up a career worst 78 wRC+ in 72 games. All of the the underlying power metric were considerably down. He has a long enough track record to say it is highly likely he will have a major bounce back in 2024 to get back to career normal levels, which is about a .250 hitter with 20 homers. Travis d'Arnaud leaving town will also help his playing time, and while Drake Baldwin is knocking on the door, he's a rookie who isn't necessarily the best defensive catcher, so I don't think he will be a major threat if Murphy is playing well. Or at least not as much of a threat as d'Arnaud. Muphy should get back to being a good fantasy catcher in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 69/20/73/.246/.337/.431/1

Tier 5

21) Bo Naylor - CLE, C, 25.1 - Naylor followed up his strong rookie season with the classic sophomore slump. He put up a 74 wRC+ with a .201 BA, 13 homers, and 6 steals in 123 games. The underlying numbers were just as bad with a .260 xwOBA and 31.4/7.5 K%/BB% in 123 games. But the good news is that underlying numbers of the underlying numbers are actually pretty encouraging. A 8.1% Barrel% with a 28.3% whiff% and 27.2% Chase% is actually pretty good. That collection of skills tells me what he did in 2024 is not his true talent level, and that we should expect a much better year 3. He was also the 6th best defensive catcher in baseball according to Fangraphs, so Cleveland should give his bat every opportunity to hit it's stride. He's still a very enticing young catcher despite the terrible season. - 2025 Projection: 64/20/64/.228/.309/.418/8

22) Josue Briceno - DET, C/1B, 20.6 - As the world's foremost expert on Josue's, I presented you with the first zero hype Josue to pick up as quick as possible in 2022 (Josue De Paula), and then knowing a good Josue when I see one, I did the same for the 2nd zero hype Josue in 2023 (Josue Briceno). Both of their hypes have grown considerably since then, and if not for a knee sprain knocking out 2 and a half months of Briceno's season, his hype could have been even more. But he's making up for lost time right now in the AFL, winning the MVP award with 10 homers and a 1.376 OPS in 25 games. Even with the knee injury and not really having a good regular season, he still ended up with a 123 wRC+, 89.8 MPH EV and 14.8/12.5 K%/BB% in 40 games at Single-A. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with a potentially special hit/power combo. He's likely a 1B long term, which is perfect for his type of bat. Even with his profile rising, it's still not enough. He remains a major target for me this off-season. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.275/.350/.488/3

23) Kyle Teel - BOS, C, 23.2 - Teel was known as a high floor, lower ceiling, quick moving college catcher in last year's FYPD, and that is exactly what he did in 2024. He slashed .288/.386/.433 with 13 homers, 12 steals, and a 23.0/13.5 K%/BB% in 112 games split between Double-A (145 wRC+) and Triple-A (97 wRC+). His 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A isn't super impressive, but he knows how to lift and pull it, so he should get the most out of his raw power. He's also a good athlete who likes to run relative to other catchers, so that can help his fantasy value even if the homer totals aren't huge. He should take over at least a large share of Boston's catcher job at some point in 2025. The deeper the league, the more value he has, but even in a shallow league I don't think he's the worst stash. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/34/.244/.311/.383/4 Prime Projection: 74/17/68/.268/.342/.430/9

24) Ethan Salas - SDP, C, 18.10 - Salas is an example of where pushing your prospects too fast goes wrong, although what Salas did as a 17/18 year old at High-A has to be graded on a major curve, and most importantly, it doesn't matter what his numbers were this year. The only thing that matters is if he's developing to be an impact major league player down the line, so it's even too early to say it was a mistake. He slashed .206/.288/.311 with 4 homers, 10 steals, and a 20.9/10.0 K%/BB% in 111 games. The strong K/BB rate is important, because it shows he wasn't completely overmatched or anything. He was also a bit better towards the end of the season with a .723 OPS in his final 28 games, which he's carried over into the AFL with a .751 OPS in 23 games. And he hit really well in 2023 at Single-A, so he does have a track record to look at to not be overly concerned about this year. He's an excellent defensive catcher who will have no problems sticking behind the dish, and that will also juice up his trade value as he ranks extremely high on real life lists. Catchers get downgraded in fantasy in general, and while I do still like his bat a lot, there is a question about exactly how high his offensive upside is. I would value him as a really good prospect, but not an elite one. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/85/.269/.342/.468/9

25) Alejandro Kirk - TOR, C, 26.5 - Kirk couldn't bounce back from a down 2023 with even worse year in 2024, putting up a career worst 94 wRC+. He hit just 5 homers with 0 steals in 103 games, and the .253 BA didn't even come close to making up for the lackluster power/speed combo. He graded out as the 4th best defensive catcher in baseball, so there is little worry about him losing his job, he hit the ball very hard with a 89.4/94.1 MPH AVG/LD EV, and the contact rates are elite with a 13.2/9.1 K%/BB%. His true talent level is better than what he's shown over the last 2 seasons, but he's the opposite of a lift and pull guy, so the homer totals are always going to be lackluster unless he drastically changes his hitting profile. He's a safety over upside catcher option if you want to protect your BA. - 2025 Projection: 49/12/68/.267/.343/.405/0

26) Edgar Quero - CHW, C, 22.0 - Quero is a super safe catcher prospect with a clear path to playing time. He's had an excellent plate approach his entire professional career, putting up a 17.4/9.7 K%/BB% in 98 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. There is some juice in his bat too with 16 homers, but there isn't huge raw power at 5'10'' (87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A), and the launch isn't very high either (7.2 degrees at Triple-A). It's an above average hit/power combo in the minors which might play as an average hit/power combo in the majors, but at only 22 years old, you can give him a bump for age to level. He's the type that has more value the deeper the league is, because I'm seeing more of a solid than standout hitting catcher. - 2025 Projection: 36/10/41/.246/.305/.391/1 Prime Projection: 66/17/72/.266/.339/.429/3

27) Keibert Ruiz - WAS, C, 26.8 - Ruiz took a big step back in 2024 with his EV tanking to a career low 85.4 MPH, leading to a career worst 71 wRC+. These were supposed to be the years he had an uptick in power, not taking a major step back. The 11.1% K% was still elite, and his EV was much better in 2022-23, so he should bounce back somewhat in 2025 in that department. He's a lift and pull machine with a 35% GB% and 51.2% Pull%, but if he can't hit the ball considerably harder, that is a recipe for a super low BA, which bottomed out to .229 this year. He'll be better in 2025, and he's still young in catcher years offensively, so I'm far from giving up on him, but I just can't get excited about him right now. - 2025 Projection: 51/16/61/.250/.300/.391/3

Tier 6

28) Joey Bart - PIT, C, 28.3 - I feel like the theme of this year's catcher's rankings are the delayed offensive catcher breakout. And Bart fits that category perfectly after finally breaking out at 27 years old after being drafted 2nd overall in 2018. Both the power and hit tool took big steps forward with the EV jumping 1.9 MPH to 88.1 MPH and the whiff% dropping from 38% in 2022 to 26.2% in 2024. It resulted in a 121 wRC+, 13 homers, and a .265 BA in 80 games. He's now in the pole position to be Pittsburgh's starting catcher, but with Endy Rodriguez returning, and Henry Davis still in the picture too, this seems like it's going to be a never ending competition. If Bart played better defensively, I would be more confident he would lock it down, but he was below average defensively. He's a low end option right now. - 2025 Projection: 45/15/53/.242/.311/.418/1

29) Agustin Ramirez - MIA, C, 23.7 - Ramirez was the crown jewel of the Jazz Chisholm trade, so there is no way that Miami makes this deal if they don't have every intention of giving him a real shot, and with the catcher job wide open, it seems very possible that he breaks camp as the starting catcher (and also mixing in at some 1B and DH). He profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher with 25 homers and a .267 BA in 25 games in the upper minors. The 18.6/11.1 K%/BB% shows the plate skills are also pretty good, making him relatively low risk. The risk comes from the fact that he isn't a particularly good defensive catcher, so it's possible the bat will have to hit well enough to profile at 1B/DH as well. He also has former first round Joe Mack and his 2024 breakout right behind him, so there is definitely going to be some competition for that job in the near future. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/36/.238/.309/.418/2 Prime Projection: 58/19/69/.251/.328/.439/5

30) Drake Baldwin - ATL, C, 24.1 - Baldwin has a path to playing time problem with Sean Murphy under contract through 2028 at least, and I don't see why Atlanta would be motivated to trade either one of them (although it's certainly possible). Both of their bats are good enough to get some DH at bats, so I think both could theoretically survive even without a trade, but it cuts majorly into the projected playing time for them over the next several years. It's a shame for fantasy, because Baldwin is proving to have one of the most exciting prospect catcher bats in the game. He destroyed Triple-A with 12 homers, a 92.8 MPH EV, a 16.2/15.6 K%/BB% and 135 wRC+ in 72 games. He has the power, contact and plate approach to be a Top 5 fantasy catcher at peak, but along with Sean Murphy, there are a few things keeping me from going too crazy. His 96 wRC+ in 52 games at Double-A was not as good as his Triple-A run. His 7.7 degree launch isn't great and his groundball rates have been pretty high in the upper minors. His hit tool is also projected to be closer to average at best, rather than a truly impact tool. You don't need to be all that great to be one of the top hitting catchers in baseball, but tack on Sean Murphy to all of that, and he lands more as a Top 100 prospect for me rather than one I'm really targeting. - 2025 Projection: 18/5/22/.238/.307/.399/1  Prime Projection: 64/20/78/.260/.335/.438/1

31) Jeferson Quero - MIL, C, 22.6 - Quero underwent season ending shoulder surgery on his throwing shoulder just 1 PA into 2024. Shoulders are important for hitting, and they are also very important defensively for a catcher. It definitely adds in some risk that needs to be taken into account. He's also very clearly blocked by William Contreras who isn't a free agent until 2028, and I don't think Milwaukee is going to have any urgency to move either of these guys, so Quero might have to wait until 2028 to take over the starting catcher job. Injuries and playing time aside though, Quero is an excellent catcher prospect with an above average hit/power combo and good defense. He hit 16 homers with a 17.8/10.0 K%/BB% in 90 games at Double-A in 2023. He can easily be a top 10 fantasy catcher at peak, and there is top 5 upside as well. If there was a clear path to playing time, I could see ranking him 22nd on this list. - 2025 Projection: 11/4/15/.245/.304/.408/1 Prime Projection: 65/20/74/.268/.329/.448/4

32) Endy Rodriguez - PIT, C, 24.10 - Endy underwent Tommy John surgery in December 2023, and he wasn't able to get back on the field until September 10th for a rehab assignment in the minors. In his absence, Joey Bart was able to nail down at least the first shot at the starting catcher job in 2025, which puts Endy in a weird spot. His bat doesn't really have big upside, so while Endy can potentially play other positions, I'm not sure that is a big help for us. He's not the type to smash the ball, but the plate approach is plus, he has some speed, and he can lift and pull, so he can be a nice all category contributor at catcher if he does end up winning the job in the end. This will be a competition that surely goes into the season. May the best man win (including Henry Davis). - 2025 Projection: 39/8/36/.241/.309/.394/4 Prime Projection: 72/16/66/.263/.338/.426/9

33) Alfredo Duno - CIN, C, 19.3 - Duno skipped right over stateside rookie ball and opened the season at Single-A, which tells you how much Cincinnati loved this kid. And really everyone loved this kid as a hyped up international signing who destroyed the DSL and most certainly looks the part at 6'2'', 210 pounds. Not only did he hold his own at the level, but he thrived with a 127 wRC+, 10.5% Barrel%, 89 MPH EV, and a 19 degree launch. He only hit 3 homers in 32 games, but that clearly isn't indicative of his true talent level. And he only played in 32 games because his season ended in late May with a broken rib. There is hit tool risk with a 28.8% K%, but considering how young he was the level, I'm not overly concerned with that. He's an elite power hitting catcher prospect waiting to happen, and he has the type of true upside to go after this off-season. I've been calling him a target since his signing year, and now is certainly the time to strike even in shallower leagues. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/28/82/.251/.338/.487/5

34) Harry Ford - SEA, C, 22.1 - Ford is just not hitting the ball hard enough to feel comfortable flying him up the rankings with only 7 homers in 116 games at Double-A. It's not a hard and fast line, but if you don't have the power breakout in your age 21 year old season, I start to dock some points on a prospect's future power potential. Even without hitting the ball hard, he still had a very strong season with a 119 wRC+, 35 steals, and a 22.0/14.1 K%/BB% at Double-A. He definitely has more raw juice in his bat than he's shown, so even though I do have his value sliding, it's not like I think a future power breakout can't happen, and if it does, the speed, lift, pull, and plate approach will be there waiting for it. It's uncertain if he can stick at catcher with Seattle playing him in the OF some, but due to his speed, he has the fantasy upside to profile there. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/18/68/.248/.333/.411/21

35) Henry Davis - PIT, C/OF, 25.6 - Davis was one of my biggest misses in 2024, and while I believe my process was sound and I don't regret calling him a target, it was still a miss. Not only didn't he improve from his rookie year in 2023, everything got worse. He put up a 85.3 MPH EV (88.6 MPH in 2023), a 4.8% Barrel% (7% in 2023), a .224 xwOBA (.291 in 2023), and a 36.9% K% (27.1 in 2023) in 37 games. There was all this buzz about him going to driveline and improving his bat speed, and while he did swing an above average 72.5 MPH bat, it obviously didn't matter. He had an opportunity to lock down Pitt's catcher job and he couldn't do it, letting Joey Bart slide into the job. Endy Rodriguez will also return to compete for at bats behind the plate, leaving Davis in competition with a gaggle of players for outfield and catcher reps. The only silver lining, if you can call it that, is that he obliterated Triple-A with a 148 wRC+ in 57 games. I'm far from giving up on him completely or labeling him a bust, but the bottom line is that he just no longer is someone to target, even on the low end. He's a 25 year old who isn't good on defense and has struggled in the majors. Yea, there is still potential in the bat, but that just isn't a unique profile. A lot of guys fit into that. He's fine to roster, but this isn't a case of where I'm going back to the well. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/33/.223/.298/.402/3

36) Joe Mack - MIA, C, 22.3 - Mack is a former 1st round high school catcher who had his power breakout in his age 21 year old season, cracking 24 homers in 125 games at mostly Double-A. A lot of 21 year old's have that power breakout as juniors in college, while Mack had his at Double-A. It resulted in a well above average 129 wRC+. He's built like a catcher at a strong 6'0'', 210 pounds with a powerful lefty swing, and he's known as a good defensive player. Since Agustin Ramirez' catcher defense is shaky, Mack very well might be the odds on favorite to be the Marlins catcher of the future. And they can certainly share the position with Ramirez getting at bats at 1B/DH as well. The 25.7/9.7 K%/BB% shows there is hit tool risk, so he likely profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher. - 2025 Projection: 10/4/14/.218/.283/.392/0 Prime Projection: 53/21/64/.242/.313/.431/2

37) Thayron Liranzo - DET, C, 21.9 - The trade to Detroit must have lit a fire under Liranzo, because he went from hitting 7 homers with a .700 OPS in 74 games at High-A for LA, to jacking out 5 homers with a 1.031 OPS in 26 games for Detroit. He's also decimating the AFL with a 1.158 OPS in 15 games. He came over in the Jack Flaherty trade along with Trey Sweeney, so you know Detroit loved this kid, and he proved them correct very quickly. He's a big boy at 6'2'' with a powerful swing from both sides of the plate. He's not a lock to stick behind the plate, but he has the bat to profile at 1B/DH, and I don't think Detroit makes this trade if they thought he couldn't stick there. Detroit doesn't have a strong organizational catcher depth chart at all, so they have every reason to stick with him there. He profiles as your classic low BA slugging catcher if he sticks. He's less exciting as a 1B/DH prospect, but still not a bad prospect there either. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/24/73/.242/.323/.460/2

38) Eduardo Tait - PHI, C, 18.7 - Tait started his career as a 16 year old in 2023 ... we think. Baseball has been catching players lie about their ages more and more, and lying about your age has really always been a thing in spots. I remember back in 2021 the Danny Almonte Little League World Series controversy where he ended up being two years older than claimed. I always assumed it was kinda an open secret that teams knew the players real ages internally, and it seems MLB is now trying to crack down on it. It's always something I had in the back of my mind, but it's never something I took into account when ranking players. I can't just make wild speculations on which players are older than they claim, and beyond that, try to guess how much older. It just seems like too many wild goose chases, witch hunts, etc ... and it's just not something I want to poison my love for the game and prospects with. I want to get excited about these players, not think about them with a cloud of suspicion. I'm not using the Tait blurb to say all this for any reason other than being a professional baseball player at 16 years old is cool as hell, ha, and not only that, he's a damn good one. He ripped up the DSL in 2023, and then he came stateside in 2024 and just kept on raking. He smacked 6 homers with a 14.6% K% and 132 wRC+ in 51 games in rookie ball, and then he got the call to Single-A and crushed 5 homers with a 28.9% K% and 117 wRC+ in 28 games. He did this as a 17 year old. He's a thick 6'0'' with a whip quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. There are questions if he can stick behind the plate and he chases a lot, so plenty of refinement is still needed, but who didn't need refinement at 17 years old. He's a really good candidate to be one of the best offensive catcher prospects in the game in the next 1-2 years. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 64/24/77/.260/.318/.450/3

39) Blake Mitchell - KCR, C, 20.8 - It was a bit of a head scratcher when the Royals selected Mitchell 8th overall, and while I still question the pick a bit, Mitchell proved he is an excellent catcher prospect in his first full year of pro ball. He slashed .238/.376/.439 with 18 homers, 25 steals, and a 30.5/17.0 K%/BB% in 106 games at Single-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+. He has a quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to lift and pull, giving him considerable power upside at peak, and while he's not a burner, the 25 steals show how good of an athlete he is. He should at least chip in there. Of course, the big question is the hit tool. If he can just get to below average, he can be your classic low BA slugging catcher, but there is no guarantee he can get to that. Add a star in OBP leagues because he walks a ton, but the hit tool is going to have to show improvement no matter what. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/25/74/.227/.314/.438/9

Tier 7

40) Jonah Heim - TEX, C, 29.9 - Heim had a terrible season with a 70 wRC+ in 131 games, and while the underlying numbers back it up with a .277 xwOBA, the individual components of the underlying numbers were mostly in line with career norms, so he should bounce back in 2025. The 88.5 MPH EV, 14.5 degree launch and 18.3% K% all look good. Having said that, he now has a career .228 BA in 1,768 PA, which is a large enough sample for that to be the expectation moving forward, and he doesn't really have the power to make up for that. He's a low end option, but he firmly has the starting catcher job, and there is some semblance of upside. - 2025 Projection: 50/16/62/.233/.292/.396/2

41) Patrick Bailey - SFG, C, 25.10 - It looked like Bailey was breaking out with an excellent 1st half of the season, putting up a .784 OPS pre break in 69 games, but it fell apart in the 2nd half with a .434 OPS in his final 52 games. It's the 2nd year in a row he's massively underperformed his underlying numbers with a .319 xwOBA vs. .281 wOBA, and he hit the ball extremely hard with a 91.2 MPH EV, so there are some positive takeaways here. His plate approach also took a step forward with a very solid 22.3/8.7 K%/BB%. We've talked a lot about how catchers take much longer to develop offensively, so Bailey could be on that late 20's breakout track, although his home ballpark will subdue whatever breakout he does have. - 2025 Projection: 54/13/58/.249/.312/.385/3

Tier 8

42) Hunter Goodman - COL, C/OF, 25.6 - Goodman is not a good defensive catcher, making it more likely that Drew Romo is going to be Colorado's starting catcher of the future, and they don't really have openings in their short term or long term outfield either. I don't know where he fits in, but if he does work his way into playing time, the guy is going to jack dingers. His 74.9 MPH swing is elite, and it resulted in 13 homers in 70 MLB games with a 12.8% Barrel% to back it up. The hit tool and plate approach are atrocious though with a 28.6/3.6 K%/BB%, .190 BA, and .238 OBP. I just don't see him as more than a part time power bat long term, but I'm a sucker for that bat speed, he hits in Coors, and it's conceivable they give him a shot at catcher. - 2025 Projection: 33/10/41/.215/.278/.415/1

43) Adrian Del Castillo - ARI, C, 25.6 - Del Castillo is not a good defensive catcher, and he might be a DH only, which is a major problem in projecting his future playing time. His bat is really going to have to max out, and the good news is that it maxed out in 2024. He utterly obliterated Triple-A with a 144 wRC+, 26 homers, and a 16.9/11.6 K%/BB% in 105 games, and then he utterly obliterated the majors with a 146 wRC+, 4 homers, and a 32.2/8.0 K%/BB% in 25 games. As you can see from that K/BB though, the hit tool is a major risk, and his strikeout rates in the minors prior to this season were very high. The power is plus and he puts the ball in the air, but the hit tool risk combined with the poor defense could be enough to keep him as a bench bat. He's highly unlikely to take the starting catcher job away from Gabriel Moreno anyway, even if he was better on defense. In most leagues, he's probably someone you jump on when/if he does get in the lineup, rather than someone you hold waiting for it. - 2025 Projection: 41/10/47/.245/.312/.423/1

44) Carter Jensen - KCR, C, 21.9 - The unheralded Jensen continued to rake his face off everywhere he's played, and it's high time we start heralding him. He put up a 137 wRC+ in 84 games at High-A, and then he got the call to Double-A where he put up a 112 wRC+ with 8 homers in 41 games. He obliterated the AFL too with a silly 1.382 OPS and 4 homers in 12 games, but granted, I think I could have put up a 1.000+ OPS against AFL pitching this year. He hits the ball very hard, he has no groundball issues, and he can pull it. He's a legit exciting power bat with a howitzer lefty swing, but it comes with legit hit tool risk too. He hit .233 with a 26.5/8.8 K%/BB% when he got to Double-A, and he has a career .235 BA in 373 minor league games. He walks a ton, so add a star in OBP leagues, but the hit tool still needs to take a step forward to be a slam dunk starting MLB catcher. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/22/68/.232/.317/.435/5

45) Danny Jansen - FRA, C, 30.0 - Jansen's value will swing depending on where he lands. He should be able to find a starting catcher job, or at least a large share of a job, but nothing is guaranteed after his poor 2024. His EV tanked to 86.6 MPH, and it resulted in a .206 BA with 9 homers and a 89 wRC+ in 94 games. He's about average on defense, so without an above average bat, it's up in the air if a team views him as a no doubt starter. He's only 30, and he has a long track record of above average Barrels, a high launch, and above average contact rates, so the potential is in here to have a truly impact offensive catcher season if he can land a full time job. 2025 Projection: 46/15/54/.225/.313/.419/0

46) Mitch Garver - SEA, C, 34.2 - Garver caught 25 games in 2024, which is a saving grace to his value, because he wouldn't crack the Top 1,000 without catcher eligibility. He had a nightmare of a time hitting in Seattle's extreme pitcher's park, and he'll still be hitting there in 2024, which doesn't give much hope for a truly impactful season. His 89.9/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV with a 18.3 degree launch shows the power potential is most certainly in here, and he did crack 15 homers in 114 games, but the hit tool fell off a cliff with a 30.9% K% and .172 BA (.180 xBA). Garver has a long track record with a career .236 BA, but the Mariners were the worst park in baseball for righty batting average, so that might not be a complete fluke. He was terrible vs. righties last year with a .549 OPS, so a short side of a platoon bat is his main role, although he'll still get plenty of time vs. righties. He could definitely get enough playing time to be a viable starting catcher in fantasy if the hit tool bounces back, but he's no longer sneaky exciting like he has been in the past. - 2025 Projection: 44/17/53/.225/.316/.424/0

47) Jake Rogers - DET, C, 29.11 - Rogers was the 2nd best defensive catcher in baseball last year, and he was really good in 2023 as well, so I have to think he's still the favorite to get the majority of playing time in Detroit despite a terrible offensive season. He put up a 71 wRC+ with 10 homers and a 29.4/6.5 K%/BB% in 102 games. He's got pop with a 89/94.2 MPH AVG/FB EV and a 15.7 degree launch, but the hit tool is tanking him. Dillon Dingler is right on his tail, so he doesn't have much job security if he continues to be terrible on offense. He's an extremely low end option. - 2025 Projection: 39/13/41/.219/.283/.408/1

48) Miguel Amaya - CHC, C, 26.1 - Amaya had a shot to lock down Chicago's catcher of the future job, and he couldn't get it done with a 83 wRC+, 8 homers, and 0 steals in 117 games. The underlying numbers look a bit better with a 88.4 MPH EV, 11.1 degree launch, and 17.1% K%, so I do think he can have some decent offensive catcher seasons if he remains the starter. He was also an above average defensive catcher, which gives him a slight leg up on his biggest competition currently, Moises Ballesteros. If Ballesteros' defense improves to an acceptable enough level, he will pretty easily take over the job, but there is no guarantee Chicago will be comfortable enough with his defense for that to happen. - 2025 Projection: 38/10/46/.239/.304/.393/0

49) Connor Wong - BOS, C, 28.10 - Wong had a strong season in 2024, finishing as the 10th best fantasy catcher, but I still think he's going to lose his job to Teel at some point in 2025. He was a well below average defense catcher, and he got lucky on offense with a .330 wOBA vs. .288 xwOBA. His EV bottomed out at 86.5 MPH, he doesn't make a ton of contact with a 28.8% whiff%, and he doesn't get on base with a 5.7% BB%. He just seems like a good backup catcher to me, which is where I think he'll end up in the long run. - 2025 Projection: 38/8/36/.253/.309/.400/7

50) Luis Campusano - SDP, C, 26.6 - I was low on Campusano last off-season, and then I saw his new batting stance in spring training and couldn't have been more out. He then unsurprisingly went on to have a terrible season with a 83 wRC+, 8 homers, and a 34.2% Hard Hit%. He made a ton of contact with a 13.7% K%, but the lack of impact still resulted in a .227 BA (.242 xBA). He was also a well below average defensive catcher. He lost his starting job in the middle of the season, and while he's penciled in as the starter right now, I'm not sure he gets through the off-season as the starter. He's a backup unless he improves considerably both offensively and defensively. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/35/.247/.302/.389/0

51) Kyle Higashioka - FRA, C, 34.11 - Higashioka claimed a large share of San Diego's starting catcher job by June, and there is a chance they could just bring him back to reprise that role, or maybe even give him a bigger role. Or maybe a team like the Rays sign him. Point being, the free agent catcher market is thin, and Higashioka could come away with a starting job. And if he does land a large share of a starting job, he has the power to be fantasy relevant with 17 homers, a 10.9% Barrel%, and 20.7 degree launch in 84 games. It comes with a terrible plate approach (28.1/5.7 K%/BB%), but his 25.6% whiff% and 28.1% Chase% isn't bad at all, so that mitigates some of the risk (but not all of it). Lastly he's an above average defensive player, which will help him land a big role. - 2025 Projection: 40/17/51/.222/.276/.421/1

52) Dillon Dingler - DET, C, 26.6 - Dingler had a monster breakout at Triple-A, slashing .308/.379/.559 with 17 homers, 5 steals, and a 20.3/10.0 K%/BB% in 71 games. The 91 MPH EV with a 18.4 degree launch backs up the breakout, but he was already 25 years old, and he was terrible in the majors with a 37 wRC+ and 35.5/3.4 K%/BB% in 27 games. He graded out as an above average defensive catcher, but he's not as good as Jake Rogers, so the tie will go to Rogers if both of their offensive outputs are close. Dingler is going to have to outhit Rogers to take over the starting job, which is certainly possible, and he has the pop to be fantasy relevant if he does. - 2025 Projection: 27/8/34/.221/.279/.391/1

53) Malcolm Moore - TEX, C, 21.8 - This is a very weak class for catchers, and in shallower leagues, you might want to ignore the catcher position completely in this draft. But in medium to deeper leagues, Moore is your best option if you need a long term catcher. He immediately becomes the best catcher in Texas' system by a long shot, and he could be in the starter mix as soon as 2027 with Jonah Heim hitting free agency after the 2026 season. Texas selected him with the last pick in the first round at 30th overall for his prowess with the bat more than his process behind the plate, which is perfect for fantasy. He's a 6'2'', 215 pound bruiser who has a squared up batting stance that looks more like he's ready the beat the shit out of the pitcher rather than hit a baseball off him. It's kinda intimidating, and he's raked over two years in the Pac 12 with 31 homers and a .958 OPS in 118 games. The plate approach also took a big step forward this year with a 14.3%/18.0% K%/BB%. He's not likely to become a star, but he can become an above average hitting catcher. He didn't have the best pro debut with a 94 wRC+ and 27.9/7.7 K%/BB% in 25 games, but he was thrown right into High-A, and he also jacked 3 dingers, so I have his value as mostly holding steady. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 60/19/71/.247/.319/.433/2

54) Dominic Keegan - TBR, C, 24.8 - Keegan was my favorite very deep league catcher target last off-season, and he now looks one step closer to claiming that starting Tampa catcher job. He made his upper minors debut in 2024 and didn't blink with a 138 wRC+, 9 homers, and a 20.4/11.3 K%/BB% in 104 games. His upside isn't huge as he's more of a complete hitter than one who sells out for power, but he's got more raw power in the tank if he ever decides to try to unleash it. He's not known as a particularly great defender, but he's improving, and Tampa's Catcher depth chart is horrendous, so beggars can't be choosers. Maybe they sign a vet, but if they don't, I think Keegan is going to get his shot at some point in 2025. He remains a very deep league target for me. - 2025 Projection: 18/4/22/.237/.296/.368/0 Prime Projection: 55/14/61/.252/.327/.420/1

55) Drew Romo - COL, C, 23.7 - Romo was always destined to be Colorado's catcher of the future, for better or worse, and as of right now, it looks like he might fulfill that destiny in 2025. The problem is that he isn't very good offensively. He hit .297 with 14 homers and a 17.8/4.3 K%/BB% in 85 games at Triple-A, which is good on the surface, but it only resulted in a 104 wRC+ to give you an idea of the offensive environment, and more importantly, the 85.2 MPH EV is very unimpressive. He then got a taste of the majors where he was atrocious in 53 PA. He put up a 9 wRC+ with an 82.2 MPH EV and 34.0%/3.8% K%/BB%. Hitting in Coors could make him useful in some of his peak years, but even Coors isn't enough to save this profile. He's going to have to hit the ball a lot harder to make a real impact. It's also possible Colorado signs a vet this off-season, pushing Romo out of a chance to start, which they definitely should do. - 2025 Projection: 31/5/34/.232/.281/.358/1 Prime Projection: 50/13/57/.256/.309/.394/4

56) David Fry - CLE, C/1B/OF, 29.4 - Fry underwent surgery to repair a ligament in his elbow in early November with a 6-8 month timeline. That puts May as his earliest possible return date, and it could go into the 2nd half. That doesn't give him much of a shot to lock in a starting job, or at least a near everyday utility job. He's not a good defensive player, so he was always going to have to prove it every step of the way, and this surgery just seems like a terrible roadblock considering he's already 29 years old. The swing speed is below average, and the 90.3 MPH FB EV is also lackluster. He has 505 career MLB PA with a 124 wRC+, but some of that was luck with a career .341 wOBA vs. a .326 xwOBA. I was already torn on if he could truly be a full time player, and with the injury, it has me leaning towards mostly needing to see him healthy and raking again before truly placing a high value on him. - 2025 Projection: 34/8/38/.252/.330/.426/2

Tier 9

57) Leonardo Bernal - STL, C, 21.2 - The 6 foot, 245 pound Bernal is a switch hitting catcher with a pretty vicious lefty swing that can definitely do damage. The righty swing ain't bad either, and he continued to put up very good offensive numbers in 2024. He put up a 120 wRC+ with 10 homers and a 22.8/9.7 K%/BB% in 96 games at High-A. He struggled in a small taste at Double-A with a 68 wRC+ in 14 games, but the 16.4/10.9 K%/BB% shows he was far from overmatched. He's also a pretty good defensive catcher. Bernal is a very solid catcher prospect who is probably on the underrated side, although he projects as more of a solid around hitter rather than a true beast. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/17/72/.258/.327/.421/3

58) Creed Willems - BAL, C/1B, 21.10 - Willems isn't a good defensive player, he chases a lot, and there is hit tool risk, so playing time is always going to be an issue, but if he does get his bat in the lineup, he's going to hit dingers. He has plus raw power and he gets to all of it with very high flyball rates, jacking out 13 homers in 82 games at High-A and 4 homers in 16 games at Double-A. It's a good sign that his K% didn't explode at Double-A with a 18.8% K% (20.9/10.7 K%/BB% at High-A), although it came with a 2.9% BB%. He's almost certainly going to need a trade to find a full time job, so he should be solid trade bait at the deadline. And if he ends up on a team who needs a power bat, Willems could fill that role. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/22/75/.238/.312/.441/2

59) Johanfran Garcia - BOS, C, 20.4 - Garcia's season ended after just 14 games after undergoing knee surgery, but they were an impressive 14 games, slashing .385/.467/.596 with 2 homers and a 25.0/10.0 K%/BB%. He was a relatively high priced international signing in 2022 ($850,000), and he played very well his first year in stateside rookie ball, slashing .302/.408/.497 with 5 homers, 3 steals, and a 20.7%/10.6% K%/BB% in 42 games. He’s already pretty physically mature at a muscular and beefy 5’10”, and he unsurprisingly hits the ball relatively hard with a blink of an eye righty swing. If not for the injury, he could have really blown up in 2024, just like his brother, Jhostynxon, did. He's not a lock to stick behind the plate, which does complicate his future projection a bit, but assuming full health, I'm expecting his hype to start percolating in 2025. - ETA: Prime Projection:  64/20/72/.253/.325/.438/3

60) Aaron Parker - TOR, C, 22.3 - Searching for pro debut breakouts coming out of the draft has been one of my favorite things to do since I started writing back in 2015/16. Back then, nobody else was really doing it, and now I'm happy to see the prospect hounds out there giving great pro debuts the respect they deserve. Harrison Bader and Willie Calhoun were two of my favorite players from this bucket way back in the day, and both still hold a warm place in my heart to this day. Alex Freeland, Luke Adams and Nacho Alverez were 3 guys I named targets in this bucket in their draft year. And just this past season, CJ Kayfus, Tre Morgan, and Jonathan Long were three guys who cracked my off-season rankings on the back of their excellent pro debuts. Now moving onto this season, Aaron Parker, who was selected 187th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, is someone that is demanding recognition for his pro debut. The dude absolutely smashed the ball with a 93.9 MPH EV, and it resulted in 5 homers and a 154 wRC+ in 24 games. The 27% K% is too high, but he's shown a good feel to hit throughout his amateur career, and it comes with a 17% BB%. He was a 6th round pick known for a good bat and decent catcher defense. Catcher definitely isn't my favorite position to stash for fantasy, but Morgan and Kayfus were 1B without huge power, which also isn't my favorite thing to stash, but look how that turned out. He's my favorite pro debut breakout in this year's class, and is a definite target later in first year player drafts. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 64/18/69/.246/.319/.427/1

61) Cole Messina - COL, C, 21.11 - Selected 77th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, after Aaron Parker, Messina is my top later round catcher target in First Year Player Drafts, and based purely on path to playing time, maybe he should be my top later round target. He has a chance to be a good defensive catcher, Colorado's organizational depth chart at catcher is terrible, and of course, he will get to hit in Colorado. He also has the big power I generally like to target with my catchers, smoking 21 homers in 59 SEC games with the hard hit ability to back it up at 6'0'', 230 pounds. There are hit tool concerns with a 23.4% K% his junior year, but he had a 16.8% K% his sophomore year, and he had a 19.6% K% in his pro debut (17 games at High-A). Granted, he didn't hit well in his pro debut with a 33 wRC+, but in this year's catcher class, you take what you can get. He has the ability to stick behind the plate, the path to playing time, the excellent home park, and power upside. Messina and Parker are my top targets for a late round FYPD catcher in deeper leagues. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 57/18/69/.237/.312/.433/4

62) Edgleen Perez - NYY, C, 18.10 - Perez isn't my typical big game power upside catcher that I like to go after, especially if you're in rookie ball, but his supporting skills are good enough to get excited. His plate skills are elite for his age with a 16.2/20.8 K%/BB%, and it resulted in a 138 wRC+ in 51 games at stateside rookie ball. It only came with 2 homers due to a 51.7% GB%, but he hits the ball hard, so there is more game power in the tank if he can raise his launch. And he has a chance to be a good defensive catcher, so his glove could get his bat in the lineup. Ivan Herrera is my favorite dynasty catcher target this off-season, and Perez could develop a similar profile down the line. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/15/68/.276/.343/.430/3

63) Freddy Fermin - KCR, C, 29.10 - With Perez getting only 91 games behind the plate in 2024, Fermin was able to amass 368 PA, but that's not quite enough to really make him a starting fantasy catcher because there isn't much upside on offense. He put up a .279 xwOBA with a 89.2 MPH FB EV. He can get the bat on the ball with a 17.9% K%, and his 88.2 MPH AVG EV is better than the FB EV, but there is really not enough here for anything other than a deep league bench bat right now. - 2025 Projection: 30/6/30/.259/.311/.390/2

64) Caleb Lomavita - WAS, C, 22.5 - Selected 39th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, taking Lomavita might be an indication that Washington is not locked into Keibert Ruiz as their long term catcher despite Ruiz being under contract until 2032. They are also light on organizational catcher depth, so maybe it has nothing to do with that, but point being, Lomavita could start competing for that catcher job in the next few seasons. And he has enough fantasy upside stemming from his speed to be an interesting deep league option. He stole 12 bags in 55 games in the Pac 12 this year and has stolen 36 in 158 games in his career. He combines the well above average athleticism for a catcher with above average power (15 homers). The downside is that his plate approach is well below average with a 16.7%/4.7% K%/BB%, so he simply just might not be a very good hitter against more advanced competition. And we saw that downside play out in his pro debut with 0 homers, a .213 BA, and a 76 wRC+ in 17 games at Single-A. The 18.3/7.0 K%/BB% wasn't too bad though, so it's not like he was completely overmatched or anything, and he stole 3 bags. He's a deep league FYPD option for a catcher needy team. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 49/14/53/.247/.307/.412/9

65) Rafael Flores - NYY, C/1B, 24.5 - Flores' power took a big step forward in 2024, and it resulted in him destroying Double-A, slashing .274/.359/.519 with 15 homers, 6 steals, and a 26.7/10.3 K%/BB% in 65 games. He also so easily passes the eye test at 6'3'', 220 pounds with a smooth righty swing that looks like an MLB swing. I mean, his offensive power upside is no joke. He's already 24 years old, the hit tool has risk as you can see from that strikeout rate, and he's not a particularly good defensive player, but it's so easy to fall in love watching his swing. I like him, but a bench bat is probably his most reasonable outcome. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/18/65/.241/.317/.437/3

66) Daniel Susac - OAK, C, 23.11 - Susac was the 19th overall pick in the 2022, and with how many former first round catchers leveled up in 2024, it's not hard to see Susac taking that same path when he's in his mid to late 20's. He put up a solid season at Double-A with 12 homers, 7 steals, and a 103 wRC+ in 88 games. It came with a terrible 25.9/4.3 K%/BB%, and while he improved his launch this season, he's still not a huge launch guy. He's 6'4'', 218 pounds with a big and powerful righty swing, so he has legit raw power, and he's a solid defensive catcher. Maybe he can become fantasy relevant in like 2028. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection:  45/15/58/.236/.291/.417/5

67) Walker Janek - HOU, C, 22.7 - Selected 28th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Janek was the first catcher taken in the draft, but he's known more for his defense than his offense. He has an excellent glove and excellent arm, so there is zero doubt that he sticks behind the plate. The only question is how much offense he will provide with an average hit/power combo at 6'0'', 190 pounds. He hit for both average and power all 3 years of his college career in the WAC and CUSA with 37 homers and .325 BA in 166 games, and maybe most notably, he's done the same in the wood bat Cape Cod League with 5 homers and a .281 BA in 30 games. But he had an awful pro debut with 1 homer, a 29.1/3.9 K%/BB% and 42 wRC+ in 25 games, which really dampens any excitement I might have had for him. I'm projecting him as a light hitting, defense first catcher, and Yainer Diaz isn't a free agnet until 2029. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 42/14/51/.235/.306/.402/5

68) Ramon Ramirez - KCR, C, 19.10 - Ramirez was a popular DSL breakout target last off-season, and while his numbers fell off in stateside rookie ball, he still had a good season, slashing .265/.379/.459 with 7 homers, 1 steal, and a 20.7/12.8 K%/BB% in 49 games. He has a strong, quick and athletic righty swing that mostly certainly passes the eye test, and he has the big pop to back that up. There is hit tool risk, he's been on the old side for the level the past 2 seasons, and there is no guarantee he sticks at catcher, but he has plenty of development time to go, and his impressive swing/power potential makes him an exciting young prospect to at least keep an eye on. What he does in full season ball will swing his value in a major way in either direction. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 62/21/69/.246/.318/.440/3

69) Rainiel Rodriguez - STL, C, 18.3 - Rodriguez is the top catcher breakout coming of the DSL, slashing .345/.462/.683 with 10 homers, 1 steal, and a 13.6/16.3 K%/BB% in 41 games. It was good for a 186 wRC+. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10'', 197 pounds, but he hits the ball very hard and the plate approach was excellent. 5'10'' DSL catchers aren't exactly my favorite targets for fantasy, and he's not a lock to stick behind the plate, but those numbers are hard to ignore. He's definitely a candidate to be a top catcher prospect in a few years if he keeps progressing. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 66/18/73/.260/.335/.438/1

70) Jimmy Crooks - STL, C, 23.8 - Crooks is likely headed to a backup role at least early in his career, and he has a lot of competition at catcher in St. Louis' system (although a trade can clear that up very quickly), but he has the skills to be interesting in deeper leagues. His strong glove gives him a leg up as many of the catchers on this list are iffy to stick at the position, and it's not like he's chopped liver on offense either. He just handled his business at Double-A with a 156 wRC+, 11 homers, and a 21.0/11.6 K%/BB% in 90 games. He has a good feel to hit, a good approach, and he can hit it hard at 6'0'', 230 pounds. It just seems like he would be the perfect backup to Ivan Herrera, but even there he has very real competition. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 48/13/56/.251/.323/.403/3

71) Travis d'Arnaud - LAA, C, 36.2 - I'm not sure d'Arnaud deserves to crack this list as a 36 year old backup, but assuming no decline he's possibly the best back up in the league, and the Angels didn't just pay him $12 million over 2 years to not play him. He's coming off a season where he put up an above average .322 xwOBA with a 89.9 MPH EV, and 15 homers in 99 games. If O'Hoppe gets hurt, d'Arnaud will certainly be relevant, and even if he doesn't, I don't see why the Angels would sign him if they weren't going to find ways to get him in the lineup. - 2025 Projection: 35/13/43/.241/.303/.420/1

Tier 10

72) Gary Sanchez - FRA, C, 32.4 - Sanchez' value will swing majorly based on where (or I guess also if) he signs. He cracks the list because the bar to clear to be a useful catcher in even a medium sized league is very low, and Sanchez has the power to be relevant when his bat is in the lineup. He's never had a Barrel% below 10.5%, which granted, that is the career low mark he put up in 2024. He's getting up there in age and he was a below average defensive catcher last year, so he may just be a backup at this point. - 2025 Projection: 32/13/39/.220/.300/.428/0

73) Ethan Anderson - BAL, C/1B, 21.6 - Selected 61st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Anderson cracks this list more on the back of how weak of a catcher class it is in first year player drafts this year. I have to grade the position on a curve, and while staying away from it completely even in deep leagues is reasonable, it's nice to know your best options. Anderson is one of those options after raking all 3 years he's played in the ACC with a good feel to hit and good pop. He hit .341 with 28 homers in 178 career minor league games, and then he stepped into pro ball and kept on producing there too. He put up a 125 wRC+ in 14 games at Single-A and a 155 wRC+ in 5 games at High-A. He's a switch hitter and he's young for the class, two things that can portend a bit more potential than a typical college selection, and he's got good size at 6'2'', 215 pounds with a swing geared towards lift. There is no guarantee he can stick at catcher, but there are definitely things to like about Anderson. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 55/14/55/.263/.329/.411/4

74) Axiel Plaz - PIT, C, 19.8 - Plaz put himself on the map with an excellent season in the DSL in 2022, and after a down year in 2023 at stateside rookie, he once again made waves in 2024, this time in full season ball. He smashed 15 homers with a 89.5 MPH EV and 13% Barrel% in 76 games at Single-A. Those are super impressive marks. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but his righty swing is athletic and absolutely vicious. The 29.2/11.4 K%/BB% and .207 BA shows the very major batting average risk though. He's a very high risk prospect, but if he can improve the hit tool, that power will get his name spoken more and more in coming years. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 51/18/59/.227/.307/.428/1

75) Jacob Cozart - CLE, C, 22.3 - Selected 48th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Cozart is a big dude at 6'3'', 222 pounds, and he has the big lefty swing and plus power to match. He cracked 19 homers with a 1.038 OPS in 61 games in the ACC. The hit tool was considered a risk coming into the draft, and that unfortunately played out in his pro debut with a 36.7% K% and 26 wRC+ in 13 games at High-A. He's not a bad defensive player who has a chance to stick behind the plate. He has the upside to be a classic low BA, slugging catcher, but it might take until his mid to late 20's for him to realistically have a shot at reaching that ceiling with a full time job. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 46/15/54/.227/.301/.418/0

76) Cooper Ingle - CLE, C, 23.1 - Ingle was a low upside college bat who got selected in the 4th round in the 2023 Draft, and while he's still a low upside bat, he's now proven it in the upper minors, slashing .281/.379/.416 with 2 homers, 4 steals, and a 15.5/13.6 K%/BB% in 25 games. There isn't big power or speed and he's not a particularly good defensive catcher. He's likely a backup catcher long term, but if the defense ticks up, and if he can work his way into a starting job, the bat can be solid enough to be fantasy relevant. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 42/9/46/.262/.334/.410/4

77) Kevin Bazzell - WAS, C, 22.0 - Selected 79th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bazzell is a hit over power catcher who is new to the position. He played mostly 3B before his junior year, but his bat is only interesting as a catcher, so whether he can stick behind the dish will make or break his profile. His bat to ball skills are impressive, putting up a 10.1% K% in 49 games in the Big 12, and then putting up a 16.7/18.3 K%/BB% with a 148 wRC+ in 14 games at Single-A. He didn't hit a homer in pro ball with a 51.4% GB%, and he hit only 6 his junior year. There isn't big power upside in here, which makes him a safety over upside option. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 37/8/41/.268/.324/.392/3

78) Carson Kelly - FRA, C, 30.8 - Kelly is an above average defensive catcher and he put up an about average offensive season in 2024, so it's not out of the question for him to find a large share of a catcher job, even if he is best as a backup. He has above average plate skills with a career 20.4/9.7 K%/BB%, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough to truly be an impact offensive player with a career 6.1% Barrel% (not terrible, but below average). Let's see where he lands. - 2025 Projection: 37/9/40/.233/.309/.379/1
