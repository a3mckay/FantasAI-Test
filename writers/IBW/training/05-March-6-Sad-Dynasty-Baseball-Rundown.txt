Sad Dynasty Baseball Rundown (3/6/25)

New
March 6

***Sadly one of my best friend's mom passed away, who I was close with, and I will be at the funeral "festivities" (or whatever the opposite of festivities is) all day and night, so I might not be able to get to questions as quick as usual today. But in honor of her passing, and to match my mood, I will be doing a sad themed Dynasty Baseball Rundown today:

Jackson Holliday - BAL, 2B, 21.4 - Of course Holliday went 0 for 4 on Sad Rundown Day. It wouldn't be a sad Rundown without a Holliday 0-fer. He actually hit all 4 balls really hard though, and he's having a fine spring with a .732 OPS, but let's not any good news dry up our rainy day.

Grayson Rodriguez - BAL, RHP, 25.3 - Speaking of ignoring good news, Grayson said he wasn't really trying in this outing and he was just ramping up, and let's hope that is true as he looked bad, going 1.1 IP with 3 hits, 1 ER, and a 1/1 K/BB vs. most of the Twins real lineup. The stuff was way down with a 93.2 MPH fastball after sitting 96.1 MPH last year. And while he said he wasn't trying, he also said he changed his delivery this off-season to take pressure off the twice injured lat and to put it on the scapular. I'm no scientist, but that seems like a recipe to just hurt a different part of your body.

Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - 0 for 3 with a K and is now 1 for 20 with 5 K's. Whatever the opposite of kicking the door down is what Mayo is doing. Lightly leaning against it? Not even that. Weeping behind it? That sounds about right. He hit .098 in 46 PA in his MLB debut, so you figure it was only up from there. Nope. He's hitting .059 this spring.

Jose A. Ferrer - WSH, Setup, 25.1 - 1 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 3/0 K/BB. The sinker sat 97.4 MPH. The changeup put up a 100% whiff%, leading to a 57% whiff% overall. He now has 4 scoreless innings this spring. We could have had a real banger in the back of Washington's bullpen, but no, we need to suffer another year of Kyle Finnegan.

CJ Abrams - WAS, SS, 24.6 - 1 for 3 with a double but he still only has a .369 OPS in 19 PA. Dude is still hungover from that one night out 6 months ago. I'm 39 years old and even I can recover quicker than that.

Deyvison De Los Santos - MIA, 1B/3B, 21.9 - 0 for 1 with a K and is now 2 for 11 with 6 K's. Call me crazy, but I don't think he's ready.

Edwin Uceta - TBR, Setup, 27.3 - 0.2 IP, 2 hits, 1 ER, 0/1 K/BB ... Damn, even you do me like this today, Uceta. I didn't even know you were capable of bad days. When it rains, it pours.

Aroldis Chapman - BOS, Closer Committee, 37.1/Liam Hendriks - BOS, Closer Committee, 36.2 - Chapman went 1 IP with 0 hits, 0 ER, and a 1/0 K/BB. Hendriks went 1 IP with 4 hits, 1 ER, and a 0/0 K/BB. This was his 2nd poor outing in a row. Of course it's going to be Chapman for the closer role. I was rooting for the cancer survivor, but instead, we're getting Chapman. Nice guys really do finish last.

Xavier Isaac - TBR, 1B, 21.4 - 0 for 1 with a K and is now 0 for 5 with 4 K's in 7 PA. Reading the tea leaves here, these K problems might not be so easy to fix.

Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.3 - 0 for 2 and is now 1 for 17 with a .297 OPS ... this one is actually too sad to acknowledge. It's only spring. It would be crazy to let anything that happens in spring impact your excitement for Campbell, right? Right?!?!

Jesus Luzardo - PHI, LHP, 27.6 - Of course one of my favorite pitching targets got hit up today. Luzardo got knocked around for 6 earned and 3 HR in 3 IP, but good, I like it. Because maybe it will keep people off him as the stuff was still way up with a 96.4 MPH 4-seamer and a 39% whiff%.

Masataka Yoshida - BOS, OF, 31.8 - 2 for 3 and now has a 1.000 OPS in 9 PA ... you really are going to block all of the kids, aren't you? Even good news is bad news today.

Kyle Teel - CHW, C, 23.2 - 1 for 1 with a dinger and now has a 1.300 OPS in 8 PA. We heard he homered off Roki Sasaki in a scrimmage too. We could have had a stud offensive catcher in Fenway in the the middle of that lineup. But no, now we have to suffer through like 4 years of 40+ Runs and 50+ RBI because Chicago is awful with no end in sight. It also ruins Edgar Quero's value. Just killed two birds with one trade.

Luis Garcia - WAS, 2B, 24.11/Alan Roden - TOR, OF, 25.3 - Garcia went 1 for 1 with a 101 MPH homer and 2 walks and now has a 1.295 OPS. Roden went 1 for 1 with a 106.3 MPH homer and now has a 1.643 OPS with 0 strikeouts in 14 PA. And I can't even be that happy about them, because neither are one of my targets ;)

Joe Boyle - TBR, RHP, 25.8 - 2.1 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 2/1 K/BB vs. like 40% of Boston's real lineup. The walks are back, albeit only one, but I'm not looking for silver linings today. He's also the 7th starter at best right now, and once he gets in that bullpen, it might be hard to pull him back out of it. As fun as he is, he's still in flier territory in most leagues.

Mike Trout - LAA, OF, 33.8 - 1 for 3 with his 2nd bomb this spring and now has a 1.588 OPS in 17 PA. Sure he's healthy now, but how long is that going to last? Also, save some dingers for my long shot bet on you leading the league in homers. These don't count for me.

Nolan Jones - COL, OF, 26.10 - 0 for 3 and now has a .317 OPS in 26 PA ... the bounce back is nowhere in sight

Nolan Schanuel - LAA, 1B, 23.2 - 0 for 3 and now has a .535 OPS with 0 homers in 20 PA ... no signs of a power uptick detected, like, at all

James Wood - WAS, OF, 22.7 - In the Bizzarro World Rundown, the Bottom of the Rundown is good news ... 1 for 3 with a 110.8 MPH bomb and now has a 1.067 OPS in 10 PA ... you're the man, Wood!

Garrett Crochet – BOS, LHP, 25.9 – 3 IP, 2 hits, 0 ER, 7/1 K/BB ... he's coming for that #1 dynasty pitcher in the game spot. Watch your back, Skenes.

Logan Henderson - MIL, RHP, 23.1 - 2.2 IP, 2 hits, 0 ER, 3/1 K/BB. It was against Chicago's scrubs, but I'm pumped the fastball was sitting 94.1 MPH, and he missed a ton of bats with a 39% whiff%. It was a short outing, but it wasn't that short, so nice to see he has that in him. Henderson is a really strong, reasonably priced proximity play.

Reese Olson - DET, RHP, 25.8 - 3 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 4/0 K/BB vs. a mostly Quad-A Tigers lineup. Competition wasn't great, but the stuff was up too with the 4-seamer up to 95.2 MPH (94.2 MPH in 2024). I feel like I've quietly been pretty high on Olson relative to consensus, but if he keeps pitching well, I won't be so quiet about it;)

Arjun Nimmala - TOR, SS, 19.6 - Nimmala blasted a homer that drew audible gasps from both the crowd and the booth. It's only 4 PA, but he sure doesn't look overmatched with a 2.000 OPS. He could explode in 2025.

Chase Burns - CIN, RHP, 22.3 - We got our first look at Burns, and oh boy, he was electric. He went 1 IP with 1 hit, 0 ER, and a 3/1 K/BB. The fastball sat 99.6 MPH and put up a 40% whiff%. The slider was unhittable with a 100% whiff%. If this can't pull me out of this funk, nothing can!

Hope this Rundown didn't get you too down! Please know it was done tongue in cheek! (other than the death part, that wasn't tongue in cheek, as much as I wish it was) Love you all!
