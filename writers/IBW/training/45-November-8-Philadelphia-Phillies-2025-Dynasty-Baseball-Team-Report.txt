We start with the Top Prospect list today because I find Philadelphia's prospects more interesting than their major leaguers. The MLB guys are down below. And away we go ...

Philadelphia Phillies Top 10 2025 Dynasty Baseball Prospects

1) Andrew Painter - PHI, RHP, 22.0 - Painter underwent Tommy John surgery in late July 2023 and missed the entire 2024 regular season, but he got healthy in time for the AFL, and he's gone right back to dominating with a 2.08 ERA, 0.77 WHIP, and 12/2 K/BB in 13 IP over 5 outings. Just seeing that he was able to ramp up and start pitching in games without getting re-injured is a big first step that we can cross off our worry list this off-season. But he's also proving he is nearly 100% healthy with the plus to double plus fastball sitting mid to upper 90's. Like we saw with Shane Baz, it seems that breaking ball crispness and consistency can be something that lags behind after Tommy John, but long term the slider projects as plus and he also throws a lesser used curve and change that could end up plus pitches in their own right. If you ignore the injury, he's basically a perfect pitching prospect with size, athleticism, velocity, double plus fastball, plus secondary, diverse pitch mix, and plus control. And now that we've seen him back on the mound and thriving, the injury risk is a bit lessened. He's a strong contender for #1 pitching prospect in the game, and I have it as a two man race right now between Painter and Schultz. My guess is that he starts the year in the minors, but they aren't going to keep him down for long if he looks good, and he's liable to win a job out of Spring as well. 2025 Projection: 8/3.68/1.20/117 in 110 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.18/0.99/225 in 180 IP

2) Justin Crawford - PHI, OF, 21.3 - Crawford is just raw talenting his way through the minor leagues with elite bloodlines and elite talent an uber athletic 6'2'', 188 pounds. He slashed .313/.360/.444 with 9 homers, 42 steals, and an 18.7/6.4 K%/BB% in 110 games split between High-A and Double-A. He was even better at Double-A than he was at High-A with a 140 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed, he hits the ball hard, and he has a good feel to hit. It's pure talent baby, but if he doesn't start to refine his game, it will eventually catch up to him. He has an extreme 61% GB% and he chases a ton. Good defense and good pitchers, which he will find in the majors, are better able to take advantage of that than minor leaguers. But if he can start to refine his game, and at only 21 years old, I don't see why he wouldn't, watch the hell out. The upside is a legit elite dynasty asset, and while I wouldn't bet on him reaching that lofty ceiling, he can be a game changing fantasy player with even a moderately good outcome. I think there is too much focus on his deficiencies, and not enough focus on what he does well. I love him. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 86/17/64/.273/.322/.420/39

3) Aidan Miller - PHI, SS, 20.10 - Miller wasn't a target for me in last year's FYPD class based on his perceived value/hype, but he proved the hype was warranted in his pro debut, obliterating Single-A with a 153 wRC+, and hitting well at the more age appropriate High-A, slashing .258/.353/.444 with 6 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.1/11.6 K%/BB% in 58 games. His big, quick and powerful righty swing was what everyone fell in love with originally, and he proved he can combine that with a good feel to hit, a good approach, and good athleticism. He can also play a decent SS, so his glove is likely to stick somewhere on the infield and potentially end up an asset as well. He's not exactly standout in any one area at the moment, but there is power upside in the bat which gives him the ceiling of a do everything, middle of the order masher. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.269/.342/.468/15

4) Moises Chace - PHI, RHP, 21.10 - Chace has one of those beautiful double plus fastballs that is just a wonder to watch. It visually looks like it's swimming through the air, picking up speed before it blows by some poor minor league hitter. Saying it's explosive would be an understatement. It's been racking up strikeouts in the lower minors since 2021, and then he got his first shot at the upper minors to close out 2024, and he shined with a 3.66 ERA and 45.5/9.1 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP over 4 outings. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus slider and solid changeup. The one thing that can tank him is his control as he put up a 12% BB% in 80.1 IP on the season, and it's been even worse than that in the past. It definitely might end up being the fatal flaw which puts him in the bullpen, and it prevents me from really going too crazy here, because I do love the stuff. Even with that risk, he's an excellent upside pitching prospect who should come at a very reasonable price. This isn't a comp, but think something like what DJ Herz did this year. I'm going after him. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.81/1.27/168 in 150 IP

5) Griffin Burkholder - PHI, OF, 19.7 - Selected 63rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Burkholder is a strong and physical 6'2'', 195 pounds with double plus speed, potentially plus power, and a good feel to hit. He's definitely the type of explosive athlete to jump off the screen with electric bat speed, and that explosiveness shined through in just one single game in his pro debut. He went 1 for 2 with a triple, and tell me you don't get exited just watching that. He still needs to learn to tap into his raw power and there are still questions on just how good the hit tool will be, but this is a very enticing high school bat with legit upside. He's a definite target. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 84/20/76/.257/.328/.443/28

6) Eduardo Tait - PHI, C, 18.7 - Tait started his career as a 16 year old in 2023 ... we think. Baseball has been catching players lie about their ages more and more, and lying about your age has really always been a thing in spots. I remember back in 2001 the Danny Almonte Little League World Series controversy where he ended up being two years older than claimed. I always assumed it was kinda an open secret that teams knew the players real ages internally, and it seems MLB is now trying to crack down on it. It's always something I had in the back of my mind, but it's never something I took into account when ranking players. I can't just make wild speculations on which players are older than they claim, and beyond that, try to guess how much older. It just seems like too many wild goose chases, witch hunts, etc ... and it's just not something I want to poison my love for the game and prospects with. I want to get excited about these players, not think about them with a cloud of suspicion. I'm not using the Tait blurb to say all this for any reason other than being a professional baseball player at 16 years old is cool as hell, ha, and not only that, he's a damn good one. He ripped up the DSL in 2023, and then he came stateside in 2024 and just kept on raking. He smacked 6 homers with a 14.6% K% and 132 wRC+ in 51 games in rookie ball, and then he got the call to Single-A and crushed 5 homers with a 28.9% K% and 117 wRC+ in 28 games. He did this as a 17 year old. He's a thick 6'0'' with a whip quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. There are questions if he can stick behind the plate and he chases a lot, so plenty of refinement is still needed, but who didn't need refinement at 17 years old. He's a really good candidate to be one of the best offensive catcher prospects in the game in the next 1-2 years. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 64/24/77/.260/.318/.450/3

7) Staryln Caba - PHI, SS, 19.4 - Caba is a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect with an elite glove at SS and little to no raw or game power, but that doesn't mean he isn't enticing at all for fantasy. His plate skills are elite with both plus contact rates and a plus approach. He put up a 14.4/19.7 K%/BB% in 78 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A. He's also a plus runner who loves to steal with 50 steals in 62 attempts. If he can make enough impact to the baseball, he could be a potent top of the order hitter with BA, OBP and tons of steals. But how much impact he will make is the question. He's not a big guy at 5'10'', he doesn't hit the ball hard with a 83.7 MPH EV at Single-A, and his ground ball rate was around 50%. He's young and has time to get bigger and add power, but just how much he can get to is the question. Guys like Caba generally top out at around Top 75-ish fantasy prospects for me when they are knocking on the door of the bigs, and since Caba isn't knocking on the door of the bigs, he's more of a Top 150-ish prospect. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/12/51/.284/.353/.395/34

8) Dante Nori - PHI, OF, 20.6 - Selected 27th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the first thing that jumps out about Nori is that he's already an old man at 20.6 years old on Opening Day 2024. I thought he was going to need a walker to get to the podium. Being old for your high school class is so 2008, when Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers book came out. These days it's all about being 17 years old. But Philly isn't afraid to take old high schoolers, like they did with Aidan Miller last year, and they went back to that well in 2024 with Nori. Nori might be old, but his tools are undeniable with a built up 5'11'' frame, elite speed, a good feel to hit, a good glove in CF, and above average raw power. His grandfather was an assistant college baseball coach and his father is an assistant coach in the NBA. He has coaches' son in his veins. The profile also mostly transferred to pro ball with 0 homers (55.4% GB%), 4 steals, a 123 wRC+ and 21.2/24.1 K%/BB% in 14 games at Single-A. I'm usually scared off by old high school bats, and they don't get any older than Nori, but I'm intrigued enough by Nori's combination of floor and upside to not get too hung up on it. I like him. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 83/15/62/.264/.332/.418/30

9) Gabriel Rincones - PHI, OF, 24.1 - Rincones is a powerfully built 6'3'', 225 pounds with easy plus power, and in his first shot at the upper minors in 2024, he dominated. He slashed .263/.357/.487 with 11 homers, 20 steals, and a 25.6/11.6 K%/BB% in 59 games at Double-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+. He's not a burner, so don't expect big steal totals in the bigs, but he should at least be a contributor in the category. He's a corner outfielder and there are hit tool issues, but I'll bet on a guy who looks the part, hits the ball hard, disposed of Double-A immediately, and is knocking on the door of the bigs. The biggest issue is that he's terrible vs. lefties, so it might end up in a platoon role. 2025 Projection: 18/5/24/.228/.298/.420/4 Prime Projection: 68/23/75/.245/.323/.462/9

10) Carson DeMartini - PHI, 3B/SS, 22.3 - Selected 130th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, DeMartini was a pro debut breakout, and you know how much I love my pro debut breakouts. He slashed .315/.385/.478 with 2 homers, 8 steals, and a 13.5/8.7 K%/BB% in 24 games at Single-A. And it's not like he wasn't an absolute beast in his amateur career too. He put up a 1.110 OPS his freshman year in the ACC, a 1.048 OPS his sophomore year, and a 1.072 OPS with 21 homers in 54 games his junior year. He's not a huge guy at 6'0'', 197 pounds, but he can hit it hard enough, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's also not a burner, but he knows how to steal a bag. The reason he got drafted so late is that he had a 27.7% K% this year in college, but it came with a 16.8% BB%, and it was much better his sophomore year with a 17.1% K%, so it's not like he has some definite fatal flaw there. The fact that he had a 13.5% K% in his pro debut is also a great sign. He might not be a world beater, but DeMartini is a very, very interesting later round college bat for deeper leagues. He's a definite target late in the draft. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/18/69/.253/.321/.422/12

Hitters

Kyle Schwarber - PHI, DH, 32.1 - Schwarber brought his BA back from the abyss in 2024 after getting too launch happy in 2022-23. His 19+ degree launches in those years were career highs, and they resulted in a .218 BA and .197 BA. He brought the launch back down to a reasonable 15 degrees this year, and the BA rose with it to .248. Even in 2022-23 the xBA was telling us that wasn't his true talent level. A career .230 BA in 4,660 PA just might be a large enough sample to say that is a fair expectation going forward ;). And of course what you are buying is that monster power. He couldn't get to 40+ like he did in the launch happy years, cracking 38 this year with a 93.6 MPH EV, but we will take that trade off all day. He's also an OBP machine with a .366 OBP. Schwarber is a great example on how league rules can drastically change a players value. Even in 5x5 BA leagues, he's great, but in an OBP league, or in a 6+ category league, or in an Ottoneu style points league (no negative for K's), he's a next level beast. He played in only 5 games in the OF last year, making him a DH only player right now, which is extremely annoying, and while he could gain OF eligibility during the season, there is no guarantee of that. It definitely dings his value, and it's something you are going to have to plan around now. 2025 Projection: 104/39/100/.230/.343/.490/4

Alec Bohm - PHI, 3B, 28.8 - There is a reason why I am locked in on power/speed upside when targeting minor league players, rather than the better in real life, low launch line drive hitters, because even when they completely pan out, like Alec Bohm, it just makes for such a boring fantasy player. He put up a career best (other than his smaller sample rookie year) 115 wRC+ with a .280 BA, and it still resulted in him finishing 84th on the Razzball Player Rater. He hit 15 homers with 5 steals and 159 combined RBI/Runs. It just isn't hard production to replace, maybe except the BA, but if I'm going to make a BA play, they better steal a bunch of bases too. Even when a player like this works out, they still make for a kinda awkward fit on my roster with how I like to build my teams. They just aren't my type of players. 2025 Projection: 75/18/92/.278/.330/.445/5

Pitchers

Aaron Nola - PHI, RHP, 31.10 - The ERA's may fluctuate, the strikeouts may be on the way down, but there is something to be said about getting consistent 200 IP seasons of about #2 starter production. I love building the bulk of my rotation with the more volatile, young upside types, but when you can mix in a guy like Nola, who you can trust to take the mound every 5th game and produce good numbers, it provides such an anchor to your rotation. And Nola's hype/value is far from the days when he was out of my preferred price range, placing him in that perfect area of low end aces/high end #2's which is where I start to hunt for my most expensive starters. There does seem to be some real decline here with an essentially career low 24% K%, and the K's have been coming down for years now, but he's still only 31 years old, and he's the type of crafty pitcher who can art of pitching his way into a productive career possibly into his late 30's. 2025 Projection: 13/3.62/1.16/190 in 190 IP

Cristopher Sanchez - PHI, LHP, 28.4 - I was skeptical that Sanchez could maintain the monster control gains he made in 2023, but he proved the gains were mostly real with a 5.8% BB% this year, and it resulted in a very good season. He put up a 3.32 ERA with a 20.3% K% in 181.2 IP. The strikeouts were lower than optimal, but he keeps the ball on the ground with a 57.4% GB% that was the 5th best mark in baseball (90 IP min). He also has an elite changeup that notched a .193 xwOBA and 34.6% whiff%, to go along with an average to above average slider. He's not likely to ever be a huge K guy, but I think he can do better than he did this year, and his overall profile is very enticing. Solid velocity (94.1 MPH sinker), plus control, elite ground ball rates, an elite secondary, and a starter's pitch mix. I wasn't buying last year, but I would be willing to dip my toe in this year if the price is right. 2025 Projection: 12/3.55/1.21/157 in 175 IP

Bullpen

Orion Kerkering - PHI, Closer Committee, 24.0 - It's a fool's errand to try and project bullpens when the off-season has barely gotten off the ground, and Philly certainly has the money to sign a closer. They also like to mix and match with 8 players receiving saves and nobody saving more than 13 games last year (Jose Alvarado, who is still on the team). That is why you can't say with certainty that Kerkering will be the closer, but he surely feels like the "closer of the future" at the very least, and he could easily win the lion's share of the job depending on if Philly decides to sign a vet or not. If he can win the job, he's not quite good enough to put in the truly elite tier, but he's not far off. He put up a 2.29 ERA with a 28.8/6.6 K%/BB% in 63 IP. The fastball sat 97.6 MPH and was a plus to double plus weapon with a .261 xwOBA and 27.2% whiff%. The sweeper was his most used pitch with a 55.7% usage, and while it's a good pitch, the 31.1% whiff% and .294 xwOBA aren't eye popping, which is the only thing keeping him out of the truly elite range (for now). And he has plus control, which is a nice bonus for a top end reliever as many of them have high risk walk rates (hello, Camilo Doval and Alexis Diaz). 2025 Projection: 5/2.87/1.03/79/15 saves in 65 IP

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Jumping off from the Eduardo Tait blurb, there is no doubt that the renewed efforts of MLB trying to crack down on players lying about their age is very interesting as a baseball fan, and just interesting in general. And there is also no doubt that age is a major factor when evaluating young players, and you see that with teams pulling their offers to some of the players who got caught. But at the end of the day (and the beginning of the day), it's just not an area that I am looking to dive into and try to parse through. If your gut is telling you a player is older than they claim, feel free to make that gut call and move that player down your rankings, but even if my gut was telling me a player was older, I just couldn't trust it enough to really act on it. I have to evaluate the player as their official age, and I have to rank them based on their official age as well. That's just how I'm choosing to play it, and as I wrote in the Tait blurb, this isn't a new thing. It's how I've always been playing it, and I don't think I've been burned by it too bad, although I guess I wouldn't even know if I did. Ignorance is bliss ;)
