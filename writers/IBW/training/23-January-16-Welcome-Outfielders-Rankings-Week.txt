Welcome to Outfielders Rankings Week!

New
January 16

It's time to get back to the Deep Dynasty Positional Rankings as we continue down that road towards the completed Top 500+ Prospects Rankings and Top 1,000+ Dynasty Rankings. Those rankings should be completed by the first or second week latest of February (and then they get released for free on the Brick Wall in very late March, like a couple days before the real Opening Day-not the Tokyo Series). After that it's targets, alternative rankings lists, predicting future prospect lists, top 10 2026 FYPD Rankings, and then right into spring training shenanigans. It's gonna be awesome. But first, we complete the offensive positional rankings with outfielders. I'm going well over 250 deep and this will wrap around into next week obviously. First post dropping tomorrow. Catch ya then ....
