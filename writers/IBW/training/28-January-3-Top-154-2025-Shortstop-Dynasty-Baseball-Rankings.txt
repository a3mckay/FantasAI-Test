Top 154 2025 Shortstop Dynasty Baseball Rankings

New
January 3

It’s fitting that the rankings of the Golden Children of the baseball world, shortstops, fall on the same week as the hyped up New Year’s Eve. Both get juiced up in the rankings, and while they can often end up underwhelming, when they hit, they hit big. Here is the Top 154 2025 Shortstop Dynasty Baseball Rankings (Patreon):

1) Bobby Witt Jr. - KCR, SS, 24.10 - In leagues where Ohtani can't be used as both a pitcher and hitter (weekly leagues or leagues where Ohtani is split into two players), age does start to become more of a factor, so in those leagues, Bobby Witt Jr. would be crowned the #1 dynasty player in the game. Coming off his rookie season in 2022, he improved in almost every facet of the game in 2023, and then he once again improved in every facet of the game in 2024. Someone tell Bobby that development isn't linear, because his development is a straight line to the moon. He put up career bests in Barrel% (14.3%), EV (92.7 MPH), Max EV (116.9 MPH), xwOBA (.413), K% (15%), and BB% (8.0%). His 74.7 MPH bat speed is elite, which makes his contact rates even more impressive, because that bat speed/contact combo is in even more rarified air. He's also the fastest man in baseball by a good margin with a 30.5 ft/sec sprint. It all resulted in a .332/32/31 season, and seeing how he's only gotten better every single season, there might just be another level in here. 40/40 here we come. - 2025 Projection: 118/35/104/.315/.379/.555/39

2) Elly De La Cruz - CIN, SS, 23.3 - Risk? What risk? I laugh in the face risk, ranking Elly 9th overall last off-season, and finishing his blurb by writing, "I always say, 'if you can’t take risks in fantasy, where can you take risks,' and I’m not even sure Elly is as risky as people think. I’m all in." That not so risky risk paid off in a huge way in 2024 with Elly going .259/25/67. Those 67 steals led the league by a large margin, lapping most of the field. He's one of, if not the most electric player in the game at 6'5'' with an elite 75.2 MPH swing (his lefty swing is super elite, while his righty swing is more near elite) and 30.0/sec sprint speed. He crushes the ball with a 91.8 MPH EV, he brought his launch up as expected to a respectable 9.7 degrees, he brought his chase down to an above average 26.9%, and he kept his strikeout rate in a reasonable enough range (31.3%) to let the insane talent shine. And this is just the beginning. If he can continue to improve his plate skills and raise that launch, which I wouldn't see why that isn't the expectation at just 23 years old, I shutter to think about what kind of numbers are possible. - 2025 Projection: 110/31/89/.267/.348/.515/59

3) Gunnar Henderson - BAL, SS, 23.9 - Henderson massively improved on basically the only three weaknesses of his game in 2024, which easily propelled him into a Top 5 dynasty asset. He put up a .829 OPS vs. lefties in 2024 after a notching a lowly .618 OPS in 2023. I never let Gunnar's struggles vs. lefties hold his ranking back, even when it was a major point of contention in is his prospect years, and I think it's something to keep in mind when evaluating lefty hitting prospects. You often don't get that many reps against lefties, so you often see that skill develop over time when they get into the majors. Don't let it scare you off. He also improved his base stealing, nabbing 21 bags in 25 attempts after stealing only 10 bags in 2023. Granted this one was more a fantasy skill than a real life skill, as he was an excellent base runner overall in both years. And finally, he improved his hit tool, putting up a 22.1% K%, 24.4% whiff%, and a .281 BA. He combined all of those improvements while continuing to smash the ball with a 92.8 MPH EV, leading to 37 homers. He still doesn't steal quite enough to pop him over Witt or Elly, but he is right there with those guys, and if steals are devalued in your league, like in points or 6+ hitting category leagues, Gunnar would slid in ahead of Elly. - 2025 Projection: 116/35/99/.280/.370/.535/18

4) Francisco Lindor - NYM, SS, 31.4 - Lindor gutted it out with a back injury to close out the season and into playoffs, requiring extra injections to get back on the field, and while I respect the hell out of his heart (130 wRC+ in 13 playoff games), I do hope it's something that doesn't come back to bite him early in 2025. Sometimes things like that can throw off your normal off-season routine, creating an uphill battle all season. While it's something to think about, it would be much too cautious to plan on Lindor being anything other than a stud next year. After going 31/31 in 2023, he followed that up in 2024 with a 33/29 season. His 137 wRC+, 13.6% Barrel% and .382 xwOBA were all career highs. As long as the back isn't an issue, I don't see why he wouldn't go 30/30 again. If the back is an issue, there is a chance he doesn't run quite as much. - 2025 Projection: 103/31/94/.268/.340/.485/26

5) Oneil Cruz - PIT, OF/SS, 26.6 - Saying that Cruz' 95.5 MPH EV is elite would be an understatement. It is in all time great territory, trailing only Judge and Ohtani, two all time greats. His 78.6 MPH swing speed is also super elite, trailing only Giancarlo Stanton's 81.2 MPH swing (Stanton laps the field, with nobody even close to him). And he also has double plus speed with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint speed. This is an extremely special talent. Yes, there is hit tool risk with a 34.1% whiff% and 30.1% K%, but I really don't think it's as risky at it seems. He hit .259 this year with a .266 xBA, and in 1,009 career PA he has a .250 BA. He can clearly thrive with the elevated swing and miss. He put together a strong year in 2024 with 21 homers and 22 steals in 23 attempts in 146 games, but he is merely just scratching the surface of what he's capable of. He was a major target coming into the year, and he turned into an elite dynasty asset. Make sure you treat him like one this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/92/.255/.328/.474/26

6) CJ Abrams - WAS, SS, 24.6 - Washington sent Abrams to his room at the end of the season like an unruly teenager to think about what he's done after partying at a casino until 8 AM when he had a 1 PM game. Maybe he was exhibiting this type of behavior all season and it was a long time coming. But maybe this is also what a normal 23/24 year old does, and at that point of the season, the Nationals were so far out of it. I say give the kid a break, but either way, I'm not letting it impact his considerable dynasty value. His power has been slowly but surely ticking up with a 90.9 MPH FB/LD EV in 2022, followed by a 92.6 MPH FB/LD EV in 2023, and finally putting up a very respectable 93.6 MPH FB/LD EV in 2024. It resulted in his first 20 homer season in 138 games, and at a still wiry 6'2'' with a 15.1 degree launch, this is just the beginning of his power ascension as he enters his mid 20's. He wasn't as good on the bases this year as he was in 2023 (31 for 43), but he finished the season 17 for 19 on steal attempts in his final 52 games, so I think that was just a small sample aberration. And really his biggest demerit is that the plate skills haven't shown any improvement since he broke into the majors with a 21.3/6.6 K%/BB% and 35.4% Chase%. He can be an easy top 50 dynasty asset even if the plate approach never improves, putting up several 20/30 seasons, but if he wants to take the next step into elite status, he needs to improve in that area. And entering his age 24 year old season, I don't see why we shouldn't expect improvement there. Abrams is just getting started. - 2025 Projection: 89/23/76/.263/.329/.450/35

7) Trea Turner - PHI, SS, 31.9 - Turner has two big red flags as he gets deeper into his 30's. The first one is that speed first players don't tend to age as well as power first players. The second one is that he also chases a lot with a 33.9% Chase% and 5.0% BB%, and high chase players also don't tend to age well. His 71.7 MPH swing speed is very slightly above average, so if that starts to fall, along with his foot speed as he gets older, it could spell trouble. The reasons to not panic too much are that while he's a speed first player, he also hits the ball hard with an 89.1 MPH EV. He's always had above average K rates with a 18.2% K%, the speed is still elite with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint, and he strikes me as the type of elite base stealer who will be stealing bases until they rip the uniform off him. He's also only 31 years old, so we are still a few years away from really getting worried about a skills decline. If you're rebuilding, Turner definitely makes sense to explore trade possibilities on, but if you are only getting low ball-ish offers, I wouldn't be pressed to sell. I would wait for him to be putting up big numbers in 2025, and then explore the trade market again at that point. - 2025 Projection: 98/25/79/.290/.339/.472/28

8) Corey Seager - TEX, SS, 30.11 - Seager underwent hernia surgery in late January 2024, which was supposed to keep him out for a portion of 2024, but he ended up being ready on opening day, which might have been a mistake, because his season then ended on September 2nd after undergoing hernia surgery again. He was also battling some hip trouble at the end of the season. I'm no doctor, but maybe giving his first hernia surgery more than 2 months to heal before returning to real games would have been prudent. At least on this 2nd hernia surgery he will have no choice with all off-season to heal. And sandwiched between the two surgeries was Seager having yet another tremendous season. He jacked 30 homers with a 140 wRC+ and 18.0/9.9 K%/BB% in 123 games. The underlying numbers back up him being one of the best hitters in the game with a .394 xwOBA which was the 10th best mark in baseball. He's starting to get up there in age, and the injuries are starting to pile up a bit, but with zero signs of slowing down so far, I don't want to get too concerned. He should continue to be one of the best hitters in baseball for the next few seasons, and he's also a candidate to be a major producer deep into his 30's. - 2025 Projection: 88/33/97/.288/.362/.528/2

9) Zach Neto - LAA, SS, 24.2 - I was Zach Neto's biggest fan, ranking him 3rd overall in his FYPD class, far above consensus, and even I couldn't foresee him stealing 30 bags this year. He stole only 5 bags in 84 games in 2023, and his 27.7 ft/sec sprint wasn't that impressive. He actually got faster in 2024 with a 28.2 ft/sec sprint, which shows he made it a point to improve in that area last off-season, and he just decided to run more with 40 steal attempts. He wasn't particularly successful, so it just goes to show how hard it is to predict steals. It can simply come down to how much a player chooses to run. Considering he wasn't all that successful though, I think we have to consider what he did in 2024 a ceiling. Even if that drops down to 20, he has enough power and feel to hit to be a perennial 20/20 player with a solid BA. His 23 homers, 88.5/94.2 MPH FB/LD EV, 12.3 degree launch and 23.3% K% shows a player that can hit for both power and average. He's still young and was thrown into the fire with the Angels aggressively promoting players, so I wouldn't be surprised to see an uptick in both contact and power. His 6.5% BB% is low, but I see that definitely rising as he gains more experience. All of that above analysis assumes he will be healthy for 2025, and that now isn't a guarantee with him undergoing shoulder surgery in early November which puts his rehab timeline right up against Opening Day. Even if he is ready in time, major surgery like that that takes all off-season to rehab is not a recipe for a big season. I'm bummed about it, but long term, I'm not going to let it shake me too much. - 2025 Projection: 74/21/78/.257/.324/.441/18 (assuming he misses some time in 2025) Prime Projection: 90/25/90/.271/.335/.465/25

10) Matt McLain - CIN, 2B/SS, 25.8 - Don't forget about little Matty Mclain. He underwent shoulder surgery in late March and then suffered a late season rib injury which knocked out his entire regular season. But he returned in time for the AFL to prove his shoulder was healthy, and he hit well there with 4 homers and a .876 OPS in 13 games. It gives confidence that with a full normal off-season, he will be ready to build on his awesome 2023 MLB debut where he slashed .290/.357/.507 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in 89 games. He obliterated Triple-A too with a 184 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint and he has above average power with a 89.3 MPH EV and 13.8 degree launch. His plate approach wasn’t great with a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in the majors, but his chase rate was above average at 25.4%, and his 28% whiff% shows he isn’t going to have any major contact issues. He also had a 20.6%/16.7% K%/BB% in the minors. And the cherry on top is that he is a good defensive player, so his glove will keep him on the field. Assuming full health, McLain is the real deal, but factoring in some rust and/or risk from the surgery wouldn't be crazy. Just don't factor in too much, because McLain can be a really exciting fantasy player. - 2025 Projection: 82/25/79/.269/.343/.468/22

11) Matt Shaw - CHC, 3B/2B/SS, 23.4 - The little man discount never fails. Baseball scouts see a little man, and they immediately shave a few inches of projection right off the top. I don't mind it, because it consistently creates excellent buying opportunities for the right players (see the Chicago Cubs Team Report Dynasty Strategy Section for more thoughts on this), and Matt Shaw is definitely one of those right players. He went a little later than he should have in the real MLB Draft, then he went a little later than he should have in Dynasty First Year Player Drafts, and now he's getting ranked a little later than he should be on prospect lists. He's an elite prospect that gets ranked like a merely good one. He's under 6'0'', but his bat packs a true punch, putting up an 89.3 MPH EV with a 14.6 degree launch in 35 games at Triple-A. He smoked 21 homers on the season in 121 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. He's not a pull machine, but a lot of these lift and pull machines put up some pretty low batting averages, and a profile like Shaw doesn't need to only pull the ball. He can use his hard hit ability, plus speed (31 steals), and plus contact rates (18.2% K%) to do damage when he goes oppo. He also walks a ton with a 11.9% BB%, making him a likely top of the order bat. Don't fall into the little man trap, Shaw is going to be a do everything fantasy terror when he gets his shot, and with the Isaac Paredes/Cam Smith trade, that shot could come very early into 2025. Shaw's been a target for me from before his junior year of college, and he remains a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 41/9/45/.256/.318/.419/12 Prime Projection: 96/23/83/.276/.348/.461/26

12) Carson Williams - TBR, SS, 21.2 - Williams put up a 31.8% K% in 105 games at High-A in 2023, so the worry was that the K rate would explode against upper minors pitching, but that didn't happen. It actually improved at Double-A with a 28.5% K%, and that was good enough to let his special talent shine. He jacked 20 homers with 33 steals, a 11.5% BB% and a 142 wRC+ in 115 games. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 180 pounds with an explosive righty swing that is made to launch homers. He's also an excellent athlete with plus speed and plus SS defense. Tampa's SS job is literally waiting for him, and because of his plus defense, he is sure to have all the leash he can handle even if it takes his hit tool a year or two to adjust to MLB pitching. If he can keep the K% in the high 20's, he will be a beast, and if he can continue to improve on it at only 21 years old, there is near elite dynasty asset upside. He's a true elite prospect. - 2025 Projection: 28/10/35/.230/.300/.424/9 Prime Projection: 89/28/96/.254/.334/.483/23

13) Leodalis De Vries - SDP, SS, 18.6 - De Vries is my pick to be the #1 overall fantasy prospect in baseball by this time next year (in a tight race with Walker Jenkins and Sebastian Walcott), that is unless he loses rookie eligibility because San Diego are madmen when it comes to promoting their elite prospects. There are already rumors they are considering calling De Vries and Salas up in 2025, which is straight wild. It did work out for Jackson Merrill, so who am I to judge? Merrill was 20 years old of course while De Vries and Salas are 18, but I love to see a team pushing the limits and setting new upper standards on how fast a prospect can fly through the minors. And De Vries has the type of talent that just might be able to pull it off. He was sent straight to full season ball for his pro debut, and while it took him a few months to find his footing, he went gangbusters once he did, slashing .275/.400/.563 with 11 homers, 8 steals, and a 20.5/14.9 K%/BB% in his final 40 games. Even with the early struggles, he still put up a 116 wRC+ in 75 games which is just silly for a 17 year old. The thing that separates De Vries from Jenkins, Walcott and De Paula for me, is that there are zero questions about him getting to his raw power. He put up a 32.4% GB%, 49.3% FB%, and 49.5% Pull%. I fully believe those other guys will get to their raw power as well, don't get me wrong, but De Vries seems to be one step ahead of them in that area. His season ended in mid August with a shoulder injury, but he's playing in the AFL, and while he's not playing especially well, it's still nice to see the shoulder isn't an issue. He's an elite prospect right now, and if he doesn't end up at #1, he won't be far off. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 91/31/99/.271/.353/.513/20

14) Willy Adames - SFG, SS, 29.7 - Adames stole a career high 21 bags and he did it with great efficiency too (only 4 CS). His previous career high was 8 and he's been a super bad base stealer his entire career. It's not like he was a burner or anything either with about average speed. Predicting steals has always been hard, and now with the new rules/bases, it is downright impossible. The newfound base stealing skills gave him the upside boost that he needed, because he's always been able to hit for power, and he hit a career high 32 homers in a career high 161 games in 2024. He's a batting average risk because the launch is extreme (20.6 degrees), the raw power is more above average than beastly (93 MPH FB/LD EV), and he whiffs a lot with a 29.5% whiff%. But now that we can count on him, or at least hope for him to steal around 15 bags, it takes some of the edge off the batting risk. The biggest issue is that he just signed a 7 year, $182 million contract with the Giants, which gives him a monster ballpark downgrade. Milwaukee was the 7th best park for righty homers while San Francisco is dead last by a mile. Hitting the ball in the air a ton with a solid, but not great EV, and whiffing a lot, seems like a recipe for a very low batting average. It also caps that homer upside a bit. His Statcast expected homer total in SF was still 31, so I don't want to tank his value, but I'm a bit less apt to pay up big for Adames now than I was before the signing. - 2025 Projection: 79/27/90/.240/.320/.455/13

15) Anthony Volpe - NYY, SS, 23.11 - Volpe has a well below average 69.5 MPH swing, and I gotta say, it has me shook. Maybe slowing his swing down was all part of the process to improve his hit tool last off-season, and to his credit, his hit tool did improve, going from a .209 BA and 27.8% K% to a .243 BA and 22.6% K%. But that still isn't a good hit tool, so the tradeoff was not even close to worth it. If he's going to swing that slow, he needs to make near elite contact, or he needs to be a lift and pull machine, which he was before making this ill fated adjustment. He had a 14.2 degree launch and 45.6% Pull% in 2023, resulting in 21 homers, which he then flipped to a 8.4 degree launch and 32.1% Pull%, resulting in 12 homers. Honestly, whoever was the catalyst for this change of approach needs to answer to this terrible strategy. The one real positive to his 2024 was that he stole 28 bags despite a .293 OBP, so it's clear he's going to rack up steals. He obviously can't be happy with his offensive season, so I'm sure he's going to go back in the lab this off-season. I wish we had swing speed data from 2023, so we can see if this is just his true talent level, or if he slowed his swing down in 2024 on purpose, but with well below average swing speed like that, and without elite plate skills, his upside is going to be capped. I don't want to overrate swing speed, and I don't want to assume he's locked in here after a one year sample where he changed his swing. I think Volpe will be able to combine the two approaches and become a very good power/speed threat, but I can't lie, the swing speed scares me a bit, and prevents me from sticking my neck too far out for him. - 2025 Projection: 88/18/66/.249/.317/.415/31

16) Jordan Lawlar - ARI, SS, 22.9 - Lawlar had a completely lost season in 2024 due to a broken thumb and hamstring injury, playing in just 23 games. He's no stranger to injuries as he also underwent major shoulder surgery in 2021. Out of sight, out of mind never loses in the prospecting industry, but Lawlar is the type of talent where you should fight that urge. He already had a huge year in the upper minors in 2023, and he's only 22, so I don't think lost development time should be a major consideration here. Even in the 23 games he played this year he put up .900 OPS, and he then got sent to the grown man Dominican Winter League and isn't embarrassing himself with a .670 OPS. Only Hector Rodriguez of the Reds has a higher OPS of players around Lawlar's age (he's outdoing Noelvi Marte, Deyvison De Los Santos, and Liover Peguero). Just the fact he's playing and getting reps in a league where everyone doesn't put up silly numbers like the AFL is another reason to not get too hung up on the lost season. He has the potential for a special power/speed combo (20 homers and 36 steals in 105 games in 2023), and while there is some hit tool risk, it's not really in that extreme zone with around mid 20 strikeout rates throughout his career. He's not a finished product, and I would expect him to start the year in the minors, but Lawlar will be up eventually in 2025, and he can make a big impact immediately. Don't ding him too much for the injuries. - 2025 Projection: 55/14/57/.241/.312/.417/21 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.266/.339/.459/38

17) Sebastian Walcott - TEX, SS, 19.1 - The 6'4'', uber athletic Walcott is the type of special talent where you can watch a few swings of his on Youtube as a 16 year old and immediately fall in love with him, which is exactly what happened when he was my #1 target from his international class. He's then been that rocket ship prospect you hope for, culminating with him putting up a 172 wRC+ at Double-A as an 18 year old ... granted it came in 5 games with a 29.2/4.2 K%/BB%, but I felt it would be more dramatic to leave that part out. And what he did at Double-A was more or less meaningless when he was already over 4 years younger than the average player at High-A, where he slashed .261/.342/.443 with 10 homers, 26 steals, and a 25.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 116 games. It was good for a 123 wRC+. It can be harder to evaluate players when they are so much younger than the level, but there was actually a similarly talented 18 year old at High-A all season with Walcott, Ethan Salas, and Salas put up a 75 wRC+ for comparison. The elite dynasty asset potential is clear with a potentially plus to double plus power/speed combo, but he's not quite there yet. The hit tool is still a risk and the K rates have been high at every stop. He also hasn't fully tapped into his raw power yet with relatively low flyball rates (although he pulls the ball over 50%). I wouldn't quite place him in the truly elite prospect tier, but he's in the one right under that. He's a Top 15 prospect. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 87/28/94/.263/.339/.484/24

18) Marcelo Mayer - BOS, SS, 22.3 - Mayer was the 4th overall pick in the draft and just put up a 142 wRC+ in his age 21 year old season at Double-A, and the hype still feels so subdued on him. He might have to get used to that, because it seems like he's setting up for a Bryan Reynolds-like fantasy career. Really good, but not good enough for anyone to seemingly care to really gush over him. That 142 wRC+ came with only 8 homers and 13 steals in 77 games. He did it on the back of the hit tool with a .307 BA and 19.7/9.0 K%/BB%, but the .367 BABIP did some of that heavy lifting, and his strikeout rates have been on the high side throughout his career, so you can't really bank on a truly elite hit tool long term. His sweet lefty swing at 6'3'' is what got him drafted so highly, and that swing is still special with power and quickness, but it's geared more for all around hitting than pure homer power with a 47.4% GB% and 26.5% FB%. He's a good baserunner, but he's not a burner, so you can't count on huge steal totals either. Reynolds is really the perfect comp with his 162 game career averages of a .276 BA, .352 OBP, 25 homers and 8 steals. Maybe playing with Boston instead of Pittsburgh will garner him more hype in the long run, but fantasy wise, that equals a really good fantasy player who never quite reaches great levels. - 2025 Projection: 28/8/33/.256/.318/.415/6 Prime Projection: 91/25/93/.276/.352/.470/11

19) Colt Emerson - SEA, SS, 19.8 - There is a case to be made that Emerson is overrated. He has high groundball rates and he doesn't pull the ball all that much, leading to only 4 homers in 70 games split between Single-A and High-A. It's also not a Jackson Merrill situation where the guy smashes the ball. Emerson can hit it hard, but he's not putting up gaudy EV's. He's also not a burner with average speed. So it's a hit tool first profile, and like many hit tool first profiles, the hit tool can start to take steps back against more advanced pitching, which is what happened this year. He put up a .263 BA on the season, and the 21.6/10.8 K%/BB% in 29 games at High-A isn't super impressive. A scenario where he ends up with a good, but not great hit tool, to go along with a moderate power/speed combo, definitely seems to be one possible outcome here. I'm only painting with a negative brush to start because I think it's more interesting. We know what a positive outcome can look like, which is that both the raw and game power ticks up over time, the plate skills remain plus to double plus, and the base stealing ability is legit (15 steals in 17 attempts). And keep in mind he was only 18 years old for most of the season. This is a high floor/high ceiling prospect in the mold of your Wander Franco's. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection:  99/22/72/.284/.362/.455/22

20) Ezequiel Tovar - COL, SS, 23.8 - Tovar had a power breakout in his age 22 year old season, raising his launch 6.3 degrees to 18.9 degrees and raising his FB/LD EV 1.5 MPH to 93.1 MPH. It led to 26 homers in 157 games and he kept up the power output all season. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of improvement to go as his plate approach remained horrific (28.8/3.3 K%/BB%), and so did his base stealing (6 for 11). He's still just 23 years old, so I would assume the plate skills improve over time, and he was the 5th best defensive SS in baseball, so his glove will give him all the leash he needs to do that over the next few seasons. He plays in Coors which juices up everything, but especially BA, so even with a poor plate approach, he has a .260 career BA in 1.345 PA. If the stolen base skills were better, I can see hyping him pretty hard, but the power isn't monstrous, the base stealing isn't there, and there have been zero signs of plate approach improvement, so I can't get too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 85/25/81/.264/.309/.463/10

21) Aidan Miller - PHI, SS, 20.10 - Miller wasn't a target for me in last year's FYPD class based on his perceived value/hype, but he proved the hype was warranted in his pro debut, obliterating Single-A with a 153 wRC+, and hitting well at the more age appropriate High-A, slashing .258/.353/.444 with 6 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.1/11.6 K%/BB% in 58 games. His big, quick and powerful righty swing was what everyone fell in love with originally, and he proved he can combine that with a good feel to hit, a good approach, and good athleticism. He can also play a decent SS, so his glove is likely to stick somewhere on the infield and potentially end up an asset as well. He's not exactly standout in any one area at the moment, but there is power upside in the bat which gives him the ceiling of a do everything, middle of the order masher. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.269/.342/.468/15

22) Jesus Made - MIL, SS, 17.11 - I love to see deep international prospects who cracked my Top 1,000 Rankings have big breakouts, and I thought my blurb for him last off-season was pretty interesting considering how things played out: "Stop me if you heard this one before, but the switch hitting Made is a projectable and toolsy 6’1”, 165 pounds with a swing geared towards launching the ball. He has a mature plate approach and he has the potential to be a very good defensive SS. I know these international prospect blurbs can get repetitive especially as we get deep into the class, but these are the prospects that can blow up if you want upside. Embrace the mystery. Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.258/.334/.449/12." And blow up Made did as one of the top breakouts in the DSL, slashing .331/.458/.554 with 6 homers, 28 steals, and a 13.0%/18.1% K%/BB% in 51 games. He's projectable, he's toolsy, he hits the ball hard, the plate approach is very strong, and he's a good SS. That is the total package, and while there is still a lot of risk as DSL performance is the least trustworthy, there is also truly elite prospect upside. I know there are many leagues, usually shallower ones, where gunning for the top pure upside is the best strategy to take, but even in medium to deeper leagues, Made is worth the risk. And use Made as a reminder to not be afraid to dive into the mystery that is the international class as you get deeper into first year player drafts this off-season. That is why the last third of my Top 132 FYPD Rankings are always jam packed with these guys. Low upside, boring college guys just aren't likely to be difference makers. Go for the lotto ticket. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.276/.352/.472/26

23) Felnin Celesten - SEA, SS, 19.7 - Celesten finally made his long awaited pro debut in 2024, and he didn't disappoint, slashing .352/.431/.568 with 3 homers, 5 steals, and a 19.4/12.5 K%/BB% in 32 games at stateside rookie ball. All of the explosive traits that made him such a hyped international prospect were fully present with an extremely athletic and powerful swing (particularly from the left side, but he dominated in 2024 with both swings) that already looks like an MLB swing. He's an explosive athlete in general with plus speed, so seeing the excellent plate skills from the jump in pro ball is a big deal. He does have two blemishes on his profile preventing him from ranking even higher than this though. It's the 2nd year in a row that an injury kept him out. A hamstring injury in 2023 wiped out his entire season, and a hamate injury that required surgery ended his season on July 23rd this year. The 2nd blemish is a 64.9% GB%, which is very extreme. Personally, I'm blinded by his extreme upside, and I'm apt to overlook the negatives. When a prospect has that type of upside, it almost never makes sense to trade them at this stage of their career. His value is pretty high right now, but I think he falls into the buy high range for me. Certainly don't trade him, and see if you can get him included in a trade without seeming like your frothing at the mouth for him too much, because it could give his owner second thoughts if you come on too strong. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.273/.344/.472/25

24) Emil Morales - LAD, SS, 18.6 - Morales was my 3rd ranked international prospect (behind only Leo and Paulino) and one of my top FYPD targets, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "His physicality in the box stands out immediately. He is a grown man at 6’3”, 180 pounds with a big righty swing that can punish a baseball. He combines that with a mature plate approach and a good feel to hit. It certainly looks like he can be a middle of the order beast, and he has the right team to get it out of him. He’s a definite target." ... and he more than came through as one of, if not the top DSL breakout, slashing .342/.478/.691 with 14 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.4/19.9 K%/BB% in 46 games. He's a lift and pull machine and there is potential for double plus raw power at peak, meaning the home run upside here is elite. The swing is quick and athletic, and he's a good athlete for his size too. Most places have Jesus Made over Emil Morales an easy call in Made's favor, but I actually think it's pretty damn close. Made has the hit tool and speed edge, but Morales has the game power and raw power edge, and often times that power edge can overcome all other flaws. A 22.4% K% is on the high side for the DSL, so I do agree that Made's combo of floor and upside takes it, but I'm not 100% sure I'm making the right call there. Either way, I love both, and I really, really love Morales compared to his much cheaper price. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 86/33/98/.250/.338/.519/9

25) Dansby Swanson - CHC, SS, 31.2 - Swanson had a bit of a down year with a .701 OPS, but it's just the normal ebb and flow of a career. His true talent level remains the same. His .321 xwOBA was better than the .307 wOBA, and he was excellent in the 2nd half, slashing .288/.353/.452 with 8 homers, 14 steals, and a 19.8/9.4 K%/BB% in his final 68 games. He doesn't standout in any one category, but he can make a true impact in all of them. - 2025 Projection: 84/23/82/.250/.323/.431/17

26) Masyn Winn - STL, SS, 23.0 - Winn stole only 11 bags in 16 attempts, which is definitely a bit concerning for his type of profile. He was a very good and successful base stealer in the minors, and he has legit double plus speed, but both his attempts and success rate plummeted in the majors over the last two years. He's still just 23 years old, so I definitely expect improvement there, but it's hard to just assume he becomes a true perennial 30+ guy, let alone a 20+ guy. The good news is that while he currently has a hit/speed profile, there is real potential for him to add power. He cracked 15 homers with a 13.2 degree launch and 87 MPH EV in 150 games. There is definitely room for him to add on more raw power, and he also has the ability to pull the ball more to get to that raw power. The 89.3 MPH FB EV and below average 70.2 MPH swing gives me some pause to project too many power gains here, but considering he just hit 15 in his age 22 year old season, I don't see why 20 would be out of the question at peak. My gut tells me he stays a mostly hit/speed player throughout his career, or a moderate across the board type a la the guy ranked right below him (Jeremy Pena), but I do see the upside for another level. - 2025 Projection: 84/16/62/.266/.317/.415/18

27) Jeremy Pena - HOU, SS, 27.6 - Pena was already 24 years old when he broke into the bigs in 2022, and it turns out he was more or less an already finished product. He put up a .304 xwOBA in 2022, a .310 xwOBA in 2023, and a .310 xwOBA in 2024. He gets the bat on the ball, he hits it hard enough, and while he's lightning fast, he's only an average to above average base stealer. It all adds up to a solid but unspectacular across the board profile. He has an exact 100 wRC+ in his career, which is always fun. Not a league winner, but the deeper the league, the more valuable he becomes, and he can definitely be a low end starter on a shallower championship team too. - 2025 Projection: 82/17/71/.269/.320/.410/18

28) Bo Bichette - TOR, SS, 27.1 - Bichette is very clearly going to bounce back from a horrendous 2024 where he put up a career worst by a mile .598 OPS. He has a career .798 OPS, he's never had an OPS below .802 before this season, and he's going to be 27 years old. There is no way that he isn't going to bounce back, the only question, is how high will the bounce be, and I don't think it will be high enough to warrant his still pretty high name value price. His 70.4 MPH swing is below average and so is his 27.3 ft/sec sprint. We really aren't talking about a truly electric athlete right now. The 19% K% is above average, but it's not off the charts or anything, the plate approach is bad with a 6% BB% and 37.1% Chase%, the launch is low at 7.2 degrees, and the pull is super low at 28.1%. All of those low marks have been consistent throughout his career (other than the bat speed which we don't have data on), so you can't write that stuff off due to the down season. He's only stolen 10 bags in his last 216 games, so you can't count on big contributions there either. The main thing he has going for him is that he hits the ball hard, but that bottomed out in 2024 with a 4.4% Barrel% and 92.3 MPH FB EV. Just based purely on track record and age, he almost has to bounce back, but I don't see the upside to really bet on it considering his current price (145 NFBC ADP). I'm not buying. - 2025 Projection: 76/18/79/.274/.318/.438/9

29) Ha-Seong Kim - FRA, SS, 29.6 - Kim's season ended in mid August with a shoulder injury that resulted in labrum surgery in October. It's expected to keep him out until "late April," and it seems teams are hesitant to sign him because it's his throwing shoulder. Shoulder injuries are also high risk when it comes to hitting. And it's also not great for projecting steals, because it's possible he decides to play it safe, or at least safer on the bases to not reinjure the shoulder. So he doesn't seem like the best value for 2025, and by 2026, he will be entering his 30's. It kinda puts his dynasty value in limbo, and I would be hard pressed to value him too highly right now. If not for the injury, I would have really loved him. His underlying skills have gotten better every single year of his stateside career, culminating with a career best 87.9 MPH EV and 16.4/12.3 K%/BB% in 121 games. He's a 30+ steals guy with some real pop (mid teens homers) and pretty elite plate skills. He only hit .233 last year, and while some of that was definitely bad luck, he does hit the ball in the air a lot, and not all that hard, so it's not all bad luck. But it's the injury that is truly holding me back, just like it's holding back MLB teams right now. - 2025 Projection: 69/13/53/.252/.336/.390/24

30) Jett Williams - NYM, SS/OF, 21.5 - Jett's season was a straight disaster. He underwent surgery on his right wrist just 11 games into the season and he didn't return until the end of the August. Wrist injuries are known killers for hitters, so it's not surprising to see he wasn't great after returning from the injury either with 0 homers and a .656 OPS in 33 games on the season. I would call it a completely lost year, but if there is one small silver lining to take out of it, it's that he was actually really good in his final 6 games at Triple-A. He had a 192 wRC+ with a 89.6 MPH EV. I know it's just 6 games, but it shows how the 5'6'' Jett can truly pack a punch. He also proved the GB rates (around a 32% GB%) and the plate approach (23.6/14.9 K%/BB%) won't fall apart in the upper minors. Also keep in mind he was just 20 years old this year. Lift, speed, plate approach, and sneaky pop is a potent fantasy combination, and with Williams' injury induced down year, I'm sensing some major buy low opportunities this winter. This is an electric player, size be damned. - 2025 Projection: 16/2/10/.238/.305/.385/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/66/.264/.345/.438/32

31) Kevin McGonigle - DET, SS/2B, 20.7 - McGonigle had one of the best hit tools in the high school class, and while this is generally a bucket of prospect that I don't go after in first year player drafts, McGonigle showed what it looks like when that profile goes right. He slashed .309/.401/.452 with 5 homers, 22 steals, and a 8.5/14.0 K%/BB% in 74 games split between Single-A and High-A. He proved he wasn't just hit tool though, hitting the ball pretty hard with a 88.9 MPH EV at Single-A, and also showing base stealing skills (22 for 24 on the bases). He didn't have any groundball issues and he pulled the ball a lot (well over 50% pull rate). Even during the regular season I got too locked into him as a hit tool guy, when there is more to his skillset than that. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10", 187 pounds, and I still see more of a moderate power/speed combo, so I still don't mind my Stevan Kwan 2.0 comp, but McGonigle is already hitting the ball harder (and pulling the ball a lot more), so he can end up a souped up version of Kwan. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 92/15/58/291/.362/.422/21

32) Xander Bogaerts - SDP, 2B/SS, 32.6 - Bogaerts put up a .581 OPS in his first 47 games before hitting the IL with a fractured shoulder. He's been such a lukewarm fantasy player for a little while now, and at already 31 years old, I was just about ready to put the dagger in his fantasy value, but he returned a new man not even 2 months later. He closed out the season slashing .299/.338/.432 with 7 homers, 9 steals, and a 14.8/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 64 games. It's still not a profile I'm looking to buy into as he gets deeper into his 30's, but he clearly proved the shoulder injury wasn't as bad as it sounded. He should have a few more seasons of solid across the board production left in him. - 2025 Projection; 80/17/67/.278/.343/.429/17

33) Carlos Correa - MIN, SS, 30.6 - Correa was in the midst of his first hot streak in like 6 years (I'm not even sure that is that much of an exaggeration) before going down with planter fasciitis in mid July and missing 2 months. He had smashed 11 homers in the 46 games before his injury, and after returning he hit just 1 in 11 games. He also had a .960 OPS in those 11 games, which does alleviate some of the concern over the injury in general, which is good. And he had an awesome season overall, slashing .310/.388/.517 with 14 homers, 0 steals, and a 16.6/10.9 K%/BB%. It was good for a 155 wRC+ which was the highest mark of his career. He was on the lucky side with a .358 xwOBA (still really damn good) vs. a .385 wOBA, and once again, he couldn't stay healthy. His 8.9 degree launch still says to not count on big homer totals, and he's literally a zero in stolen bases. He's only 30 years old, and he just proved he's not planning on fading into that good night anytime soon after putting up the best wRC in his career last year, so I'm not sleeping on him as a potentially good win now piece, but the injuries, low launch, and zero speed prevent me from going higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 78/22/77/.275/.354/.461/0

34) Xavier Edwards - MIA, SS, 25.8 - I might be scared that Edwards could easily lose his starting SS job on another team, but the Marlins have very little competition for that job at the moment. And I might be scared that he could lose his spot atop of the order, but again, the Marlins don't really have much competition for that spot either. Damn it feels good to be a 2nd division regular, and Edwards took advantage of that 2nd division with 31 steals, 39 runs, a .328 BA, and a .397 OBP in 70 games. He gets the bat on the ball with a 16.9% whiff%, he gets on base with a 10.9% BB%, and he loves to run. The reason I would be afraid of his playing time on another team, is that he's not a good defensive SS, he has nearly 0 power with 1 homer and a 1.6% Barrel%, and he got extremely lucky last year with a .359 wOBA vs. .297 xwOBA. But he's not on another team, so I have little doubt that his contact/speed/runs profile can be very valuable if you have the right offensive pieces around him to take his huge hit to your power department. - 2025 Projection: 78/4/43/.280/.340/.378/43

35) Ceddanne Rafaela - BOS, SS/OF, 24.7 - Rafaela put up a 79 wRC+ with a .273 xwOBA (bottom 5% of baseball) in 152 games. Boston has a sea of studs on the way too. I'm starting the blurb out with that moreso as just a reminder to myself to not get too crazy here as much as I want to love Rafaela. He's a whiff and chase machine with a 33% whiff% and 46.4% Chase%. That is really, really bad. His 70.1 MPH bat speed is below average and so is his 86.6 MPH EV. He wasn't great on the bases either, going 19 for 29. Again, I'm saying this as much to myself as I am to you, but there is a very real chance, maybe a good chance, that he is just not a very good hitter. Now having said that, the power/speed combo is super fun for fantasy with an above average 7.5% Barrel%, 14.9 degree launch, and 28.8 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in 15 homers and 19 steals. He also has defensive versality, so even as a super utility player/next man up at several positions type player, that can still equal basically full time at bats over the course of the season. And he has a possibly elite CF glove, so even if they have other players that can play center, they can't play it nearly as well as Rafaela. The bat needs to take a step forward though, and I'm not so sure it's such a sure bet that it's going to happen. It might be a super utility profile on the MLB level when it's all said and done, but he's still young, and that definitely isn't the ceiling. - 2025 Projection: 71/17/74/.244/.295/.402/24

36) Trevor Story - BOS, SS, 32.5 - Story hurt his shoulder just 8 games into the season, resulting in surgery for a fractured shoulder that kept him out until early September. But he was actually pretty good still when he returned, slashing .270/.361/.429 with 2 homers, 5 steals, and a 33.3/11.1 K%/BB% in 18 games. It shows the homer/steal combo can still be very impactful, but we know it's coming with a very low batting average. He had double below average bat speed last year (probably impacted by the surgery though, so we'll see), and his K rates have been over 30% since leaving Coors. He's also struggled to stay healthy, playing in just 162 games in his 3 years with Boston. This is an oft-injured, aging profile that relies a good amount on stolen bases, so it's not one I'm really looking to buy low on in general, but for a cheap win now move, I don't hate it. He's probably pretty cheap right now and he just might be able to squeak out a 20/20+ season if things go relatively well. - 2025 Projection: 73/21/76/.228/.307/.421/23

37) Tyler Fitzgerald - SFG, SS/2B, 27.7 - I use a 20 game cutoff for these positional rankings, but with Fitzgerald set to be San Francisco's starting 2B in 2024, I'm going to include him in the 2B rankings too (I know these are the SS rankings). He had an insanely fun rookie year with 15 homers, 17 steals, and a .280 BA in 96 games, but there are so many warning signs going off, it's definitely making me hesitant to buy in too hard. The fantasy upside is undeniable with an elite 30 ft/sec sprint and 20.2 degree launch, so the power/speed numbers will be there, but the BA/OBP is a major, major risk. He put up a 31.7/6.5 K%/BB% with a 87.7/90.6 MPH AVG/FB EV. That is a recipe for a disaster batting average, especially hitting in San Francisco. The .292 xwOBA was much, much worse than the .367 wOBA. He was already starting to regress by the end of the season with a .592 OPS, 1 homer and a 36.3/6.2 K%/BB% in his final 36 games, so you can't even say the hit tool was improving as the year went on. His fantasy upside is so fun I thought I was going to like him more than I do, but there are just so many flashing red lights. - 2025 Projection: 67/21/61/.232/.298/.417/24

38) Trey Sweeney - DET, SS, 24.11 - Sweeney was one of my favorite proximity stashes during the 2024 season, even moving him into my Top 100 at some point, and his MLB debut just emboldened my love for him. He's 6'3'', 212 pounds with a 74.1 MPH swing which is in double plus territory. It resulted in a 91.1 MPH EV with a 12.8 degree launch. His 28.1 ft/sec sprint speed is above average to plus, stealing 16 bags in 96 games at Triple-A and 3 bags in 43 games in the majors (including the playoffs). He was also a plus defender at SS. This is a pretty special athlete here. His .642 OPS in 36 games isn't super impressive, he didn't exactly dominate Triple-A with a 88 wRC+, and there is hit tool risk with a 32.4% whiff%. But all of those are more than baked into his price, overly so in my opinion. My attention is on the things he does well, and that makes him a very enticing target relative to his perceived value. - 2025 Projection: 71/18/76/.237/.308/.416/11 Prime Projection: 83/22/78/.252/.328/.444/14

39) Luisangel Acuna - NYM, SS/2B, 23.1 - Acuna was in the midst of an extremely lackluster season at Triple-A with a 69 wRC+ in 131 games, but maybe he was just getting bored, because he gave his dynasty value a shot to the arm in his cup of coffee in the bigs. He jacked out 3 homers with a 91 MPH EV, 15% K% and 165 wRC+ in 40 PA. He might not be as good as his older brother, but the electric Acuna blood most certainly runs through his veins with a near elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed and a plus 73.5 MPH bat speed. He's only 5'10'', and the 87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A wasn't as impressive, but there is real juice in his bat, especially as he continues to get stronger. He's a game changer on the bases with 40 steals at Triple-A, and he's put up strong contact rates at every level, including the majors. He only had a 2.5% BB% in the majors, but he really didn't chase a concerning amount with a 30.8% Chase%. The Mets are a wild card this off-season, so I hesitate to try to project their lineup right now, but he can play SS, 2B, and CF, which means he can basically play any position on the field, so that versality will keep his bat in the lineup if he's producing. He looks like a mighty enticing dynasty asset right now. - 2025 Projection: 73/12/61/.256/.309/.394/23 Prime Projection: 84/16/69/.272/.328/.426/30

40) Colson Montgomery - CHW, SS, 23.1 - Montgomery had a pretty damn bad season at Triple-A with 18 homers, an 85.8 MPH EV, a 28.6/12.0 K%/BB% and an 88 wRC+ in 130 games. I've talked about this in a previous year's Strategy Section, but it's easy to assume every down year for a prospect is him regressing as a player, and every monster year is a true breakout, rather than it sometimes just being a down year or a career year. So even though I was a bit lower than most last year on Montgomery, writing, "Those are the reasons that make me hesitant to rank him as high as I see him in other places, but there is no denying he is a damn good prospect no matter how you slice it," I'm still not going to jump ship. His profile remains the same for me as a 6'3'', 225 pound slugger with a clear path to playing time. He also came into the AFL fired up to wash the slate clean with 3 homers, a 6/10 K/BB, and a 1.167 OPS in 11 games, which shows everything you liked about him last off-season is still in here.

41) Brice Matthews - HOU, SS, 23.0 - Matthews was one of my top targets from his FYPD class because I saw an explosive athlete when watching him, and he proved that explosiveness will translate to the upper minors in 2024, slashing .265/.384/.481 with 15 homers, 32 steals, and a 31.4/13.4 K%/BB% in 79 games at mostly Double-A (but also rookie, High-A and Triple-A). I wish I could raise the victory flag and truly explode him up the rankings, but unfortunately the hit tool was a bit worse than hoped. He was hanging in there with a 26.8% K% at High-A, but it immediately jumped to 33.7% at Double-A, and then 39.6% to close out in the season in 12 games at Triple-A. He's now in the Puerto Rican Winter League and has a 35.3% K% in 20 games. Sure he's 5.4 years younger than average in that league, but he's already a 22 year old college bat who could conceivably break into the majors this year, so he's not that young for that level really. The dude obviously has a very real strikeout problem, and I can't just gloss over it. I comped him to Tommy Pham last year, and I predicted like Pham, it could take into his mid 20's for the hit tool to click, but when it does click, the returns will be very big. I'm sticking with that timeline. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/74/.233/.318/.431/26

42) Cole Young - SEA, 2B/SS, 21.8 - Young put up a 119 wRC+ in 124 games at Double-A as a 20/21 year old, which is impressive, but he did it on the back of an elite 15.8/12.1 K%/BB%, making him a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect. He hit only 9 homers, there isn't big raw power in here, and he's not a guy looking to hit dingers with a low launch, all fields approach, so he doesn't project for big power either. The biggest blow to his fantasy value is that he isn't a good base stealer, going 23 for 34, and he's not a true burner, so his upside on the bases is questionable too. I don't think we should underrate the fact that he was 20 years old at Double-A, and that includes the power/speed numbers, so I don't want to to be overly harsh, but he remains a better real life than fantasy prospect, which has been the book on him since being drafted. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/17/62/.278/.349/.426/18

43) Tommy Troy - ARI, 2B/SS, 23.3 - Troy saved his season at the end of the year, because it looked like his dynasty value was in a nose dive before slashing .276/.375/.447 with 4 homers, 9 steals, and a 22.2/11.8 K/BB% in his last 32 games at High-A. He then went to the AFL and kept on hitting with a .864 OPS in 22 games. A hamstring injury knocked out 2 months of his season early in the year, and it seemed like he just couldn't find a rhythm when he returned, so there is something to point to for the slow start. The skills and general explosiveness of his game that got him drafted 12th overall are all still there. His hype definitely dropped this year, but I would be careful about selling too low here. He's still a Top 100 prospect for me. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/18/71/.251/.320/.427/23

44) Arjun Nimmala - TOR, SS, 19.6 - Nimmala got off to a slow start in full season ball, which is completely understandable considering he was only 18 years old, but once he found his footing, he showed why he was one of the most hyped high school bats in his class. He slashed .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers, 5 steals, and a 29.7/6.4 K%/BB% in his last 53 games. He has one of the sweetest righty swings in the game that is tailored made to launch the ball to the moon with a 46.6% FB%. It's powerful too with a 89.1 MPH EV, and at a projectable 6'1'', there is only more power coming. He's also a good athlete who should contribute in steals even if he isn't a huge base stealer. The biggest issue is clearly the hit tool, but you have to give him some leeway for his age, and the upside is high enough to take on that extra risk. I have Nimmala grouped with Brandon Winokur and Eric Bitonti as tooled up power hitting beasts with hit tool risk in the back half of the Top 100 Prospects Rankings. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/28/89/.242/.321/.473/14

45) Brandon Winokur - MIN, SS/OF, 20.5 - Winokur is one of my favorite prospect targets right now relative to perceived value. 6'6'', 210 pound athletes like this don't grow on trees, and I think he deserves to rise to true unicorn status. His big time power is obvious, and it resulted in 14 homers with a 89.6 MPH EV in 94 games at Single-A. The area of his game that gets considerably underrated, is how good of an athlete he is. He put up plus run times in high school, and then he went out and stole 23 bags in 29 attempts this year. He played both SS and CF this year. This is not some lumbering corner bat. This is a unicorn with real defensive value. The problem, of course, is the hit tool. He put up a 28.0/8.3 K%/BB% and he swings and misses a lot. There is no denying there is very real risk here, but that is why he isn't like a Top 50 prospect. As is, I believe he is a top 100 fantasy prospect, and he won't be valued anywhere close to that in off-season prospect drafts. He's a major target. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/26/83/.246/.317/.471/15

46) Bryce Rainer - DET, SS, 19.9 - Selected 11th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Rainer is your classic "looks the part" prospect at 6'3'', 195 pounds with a smooth lefty swing, plus power potential, plus athleticism, and good glove at SS. Corey Seager and Kyle Tucker would be the absolute ceiling comps, while Colson Montgomery would be a more recent comp. Like Montgomery, Rainer is older for his class at 19 years old already, and his hit tool isn't a slam dunk either quite yet. Come to think of it, Riley Greene might actually be the perfect comp here, and Detroit has done a great job developing Greene. Detroit got their SS version of Greene (although Greene was a slightly more touted prospect in his draft year, so he would be close to a ceiling comp as well). - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/25/88/.263/.336/.470/12

47) Ryan Bliss - SEA, 2B/SS, 25.4 - Maybe I got a little too overexcited about Bliss when I named him a major target mid-season, but I still love his potential fantasy impact relative to his super, super subdued hype, and at the moment, there is a clear path to the 2B job (which of course could change in an instant). The main selling point is the stolen base upside with him stealing 50 bags in 93 bags at Triple-A. But what makes him so exciting, is that he is not just a light hitting speedster. He can actually hit the ball pretty damn hard, and he showed that in his MLB debut with a 88.5/98.2 MPH AVG/FB EV. The EV was strong at Triple-A too with an 88.8 MPH EV. He's not a huge lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull enough to rip some dingers (12 in 93 games at AAA), and especially in Seattle's ballpark, we don't want him to lift and pull. Hitting the ball hard all over the field works perfectly for his profile. He's also a good 2B. The biggest issue is that the hit tool is not quite optimal for this type of profile. He put up a 22.4% K% at AAA and a 31% K% in the majors. The plate approach is good with a 14.1% BB% at AAA and an excellent 21% Chase% in the majors, which mitigates the hit tool somewhat, but not all the way. That is the thing holding me back from going too crazy, but Bliss could be free to very cheap in most leagues, and why not take a shot. - 2025 Projection: 61/13/52/.237/.304/.380/23 Prime Projection: 77/17/66/.254/.325/.416/31

48) Jacob Wilson - OAK, SS, 23.0 - Wilson stole just 2 bases in 3 attempts in 53 minor league games, and then he didn't attempt a single steal in 28 games in his MLB debut. That is just brutal for his type of profile, and with a below average sprint speed, it doesn't seem like there is much hope for him to really be a major contributor in steals. And without that, there is just no upside in this profile at all with legitimately bottom of the scale power. He had a 84 MPH EV with a 2% Barrel% at Triple-A, and a 85.4 MPH EV with 0 barrels in the majors. He's a relatively thin and projectable 6'3'', so I definitely don't think it's impossible for him to gain power in his mid to late 20's, but that is an extremely low point to start from. Of course what you are buying is the truly elite contact rates with a minuscule 4.3% K% at Triple-A and a 9.7% K% in the majors, but even with that, he's going to need to hit the ball harder to truly take full advantage of that. This just isn't the type of profile I go after in fantasy, but in deep leagues where safety gets a bump, I could see ranking him higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 73/5/42/.273/.328/.381/7 Prime Projection: 88/10/50/.291/.356/.405/10

49) Brayden Taylor - TBR, 3B/SS, 22.10 - Taylor destroyed High-A with 14 homers, 26 steals, a 24.8/15.9 K%/BB% and a 154 wRC+ in 84 games, but he's an advanced college bat, and he doesn't have big raw power or big raw speed, so seeing what he could do in the upper minors was important, and it was a mixed bag at best. The K% exploded to 36.8% (.194 BA), but he still knocked out 6 homers with 3 steals and a 113 wRC+ in 30 games. He's a lift and pull machine, so even without big raw power, he can hit dingers, and he's not a burner, but he's been a really good base stealer at every stop of his career. It's the hit tool that is the real problem, and while I'm sure he will be better his second time around in the upper minors, it's still not a good sign for what his hit tool will look like in the majors. A high K rate with mediocre EV's and lots of flyballs is a recipe for a very low BA. It's still a fantasy friendly skillset with pedigree (19th overall pick) and strong production at every stop of his career, so while I can't call him a truly coveted prospect, I still like him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/20/76/.242/.325/.435/15

50) Cooper Pratt - MIL, SS, 20.8 - The only thing Pratt didn't do at Single-A was hit for power, hitting only 3 homers with a 25% FB% in 73 games, but when he got the call to High-A, he immediately proved that he wasn't going to have any problems getting to his potentially plus power with 5 homers and a 38.7% FB% in just 23 games. At a projectable 6'4'', there is no doubt the raw juice is in there, and he also proved to be an excellent athlete (27 steals) with a strong plate approach (20.0/10.3 K%/BB%). The plate approach was much better at Single-A than High-A, and some of that was certainly because he was trying to get to more of his power. So he's not a finished product, but the ingredients are in here to be an impact across the board fantasy player. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/23/80/.262/.328/.453/18

51) Joendry Vargas - LAD, SS, 19.5 - Vargas was one of my favorite targets in his international class, and then was once again one of my favorite DSL breakout targets, so if anyone wants to crown him already, it would be me, but I can't quite crown him yet. He had a strong year in stateside rookie ball with a 129 wRC+, but 4 homers in 38 games shows the game power isn't quite there yet, the 22.8% K% is on the high side, and he wasn't that successful on the bases, going 11 for 16. So that means he still needs to improve his hit tool, power, and speed. Completely reasonable for an 18 year old rookie baller to need to improve basically everywhere, and I still love the power upside at a projectable 6'4'' with hard hit ability, but it's not quite that straight rocket ship you really want. He's a Top 100 prospect for me, but I can't put him in that truly coveted tier quite yet. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 81/25/85/.257/.336/.465/8

52) Yoeilin Cespedes - BOS, SS/2B, 19.7 - Cespedes' season ended on June 21st a broken hamate, but he was one of the top rookie ball breakouts before going down with the injury. He slashed .319/.400/.615 with 5 homers, 3 steals, and a 18.1/11.4 K%/BB% in 25 games. It was good for a 163 wRC+, and this was coming off the 145 wRC+ he put up in the DSL in 2023. He's a lift and pull machine who takes absolute daddy hacks at the dish with a monster righty swing. He swings much bigger than his 5'8'' size would indicate. I'm thinking the contact rates could take a step back in full season ball, but I believe in the power despite not being a huge human being. If the contact rates don't take a step back, we could be looking at a very potent hit/power combo, and even if they do, he should remain a very good prospect. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/25/84/.268/.329/.458/8

53) Brooks Lee - MIN, SS/3B/2B, 24.2 - I've always been a bit low on Lee for fantasy, because a good but not great hit tool first profile, with moderate power and little speed is just not something I go after, even with him getting ranked very high on real life lists. I also wasn't buying into the 8 homers he hit in 25 games at Triple-A this year because of the below average exit velocity and low launch, and sure enough, his MLB debut didn't look great. He slashed .221/.265/.320 with 3 homers, 3 steals, and a 14.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 50 games. His 25.6 ft/sec sprint speed is in the bottom 13% of the league. That is brutal, and it might be part of the reason why the guy scored a shockingly low 9 runs. The EV numbers were poor too with a 85.8 MPH EV and 4.1% Barrel%. And he chases a lot with a 35.8% Chase%, so he doesn't really fit in at the top of the order. He gets the bat on the ball and there is some pop in there, so I never thought he would be a bust or anything, I just thought the upside was low as a solid but not standout hitter, and I still believe that today. He's still not a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 64/14/73/.259/.313/.415/6 Prime Projection: 73/18/81/.277/.331/.436/8

54) Welbyn Francisca - CLE, SS, 18.10 - After getting lots of hype coming off his strong pro debut in the DSL, Francisca's hype seems to have quieted down to barely a whisper despite a very strong follow up season in 2024. He slashed .328/.418/.523 with 6 homers, 11 steals and a 12.4/12.4 K%/BB% in 45 games at stateside rookie ball, and then he went to full season ball as an 18 year old and didn't slow down, slashing .325/.402/.402 with 1 homer, 8 steals, and a 20.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 29 games. He's not a big guy at 5'8'', so power isn't expected to be a huge part of his game, but he can definitely pack a punch in that small frame. And keep in mind he will still be just 18 years old at the start of 2025. He's on pace to have one of the most enticing top of the order profiles in the minors, and I wouldn't completely sleep on his power either. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/16/61/.280/.346/.427/28

55) Franklin Arias - BOS, SS/2B, 19.4 - I have Arias in the same category that I had Jefferson Rojas in last off-season when Rojas was getting a ton of hype. They don't jump off the screen, they don't have huge size, and they don't have huge tools, but they are just really good baseball players who do a lot of things well on a baseball field. I like them, and I definitely like them for real life, but they are probably a bit overrated for fantasy. Arias demolished rookie ball with a 181 wRC+ on the back of elite plate skills with a 17.5/16.5 K%/BB% in 51 games. He then got the call to Single-A and wasn't as impressive, slashing .257/.311/.378 with 3 homers, 5 steals, and a 17.5/9.6 K%/BB% in 36 games. He was only 18, so that is still a very solid line, but I do think it underscores how the production might not look so outsized against more advanced competition. He hit 9 homers in 87 games, so he has some pop, and he stole 35 bags, so a he's a good baserunner despite not being a burner. An up the middle glove with good contact rates and some power and speed is a really high floor real life profile, but we play fantasy, and we want upside. He's a Top 100-ish fantasy prospect, so again, I like him, but I don't think he's a truly coveted one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 83/18/68/.273/.338/.428/15

56) Theo Gillen - TBR, SS, 19.7 - Selected 18th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Gillen strikes me as one of the best values in this first year player draft class compared to his likely landing spot. Although he has his supporters, so his price could vary pretty widely depending on your league. He has near elite dynasty upside at 6'3'', 200 pounds with electric bat speed, potentially plus power, plus speed, and a good feel to hit. He still needs to learn how to fully tap into his raw power, and he underwent shoulder surgery from a torn labrum in 2022, so he's not a finished product, and he's not without risk. His pro debut underscored that with a  41.2% K% and 86 wRC+ in 8 games at Single-A, but the 23.5% BB% mitigates that K rate a bit, it was only 8 games, and in the past, high schoolers debuted in rookie ball. Now they are thrown right into the fire in full season ball. I would give a lot of leeway for all of these high school bats. Especially in shallower leagues where you want to shoot for upside instead of going for a good, but not great college bat, Gillen is a great target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 84/20/76/.267/.340/.447/20

57) Alex Freeland - LAD, SS, 23.7 - I'm pretty certain I'm the only one crazy enough to have called Freeland a target in his FYPD class after getting drafted 105th overall, but you know how strongly I feel about good pro debuts (and bad pro debuts), even in small samples, and Freeland had himself a hell of a pro debut with a 152 wRC+, 3 homers, and 2 steals in 8 games in rookie ball. That was enough for me to target him late, and look at him just two years later, getting major mainstream hype. Please ignore the fact that he actually didn't crack my 2024 Top 1,000 after his lukewarm year in 2023 ;) ... but my point still stands, pro debuts mean a lot, and certainly when you are looking for late round sleepers. And now that he is getting rained down with hype, I hate to be that guy, but I think he might be getting overrated now. A lot of his damage and hype came from dominating High-A in 23 games, but he was 22 year old and repeating the level. He was good at Double-A too with a 127 wRC+, but a .245/.370/.422 triple-slash isn't exactly blowing the doors off, and he struggled at Triple-A, slashing .243/.335/.396 with a 26.8% K% and 85 wRC+ in 39 games. The bottom line is that he hit under .250 at the age appropriate levels of the upper minors with a pretty high strikeout rate. He has very real hit tool risk. But enough raining on his parade. He's definitely exciting with an above average to plus power/speed combo, jacking out 18 homers with 31 steals in 136 games. He hits the ball hard and he's fast, so those numbers aren't a mirage. He also has a good infield glove, so his glove should only help him get in the lineup. Whenever a former deep sleeper blows up, they will always hold a fond place in my heart, but perceived value shifts, and my feelings on a player have to shift with percieved value. Right now, I think he might be a tad overrated even though I still like him. - 2025 Projection: 17/3/19/.229/.293/.378/5 Prime Projection: 77/19/71/.248/.324/.421/21

58) Seaver King - WAS, SS, 21.11 - You know how I often say that if you hit it hard, hit if often, and are fast that good things tend to happen, well, that is King's game to a T. Selected 10th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 195 pound King has a lightning quick swing that is very powerful, controlled and produces very hard contact. He can spray hard liners all over the field. He combines that with plus to double plus speed with 31 steals in 33 attempts in 149 career college games. And finally, tack on tons of contact with a 12% K% in 60 games in the SEC. That is a profile that consistently makes things happen on a baseball field. There isn't a ton of game power because of his hitting profile, but he still jacked out 16 homers in college, and he's an aggressive hitter with high chase rates. That profile completely transferred to Single-A, both the good (.295 BA, 14.4% K%, and 10 steals in 20 games), and the bad (0 homers with a 53.8% GB%). The hit tool and speed give him a high floor, and if he can raise his launch, the raw power is in there to give him some legit upside too. He ranked 16th overall on the Top 56 2025 Dynasty Baseball First Year Player Draft Rankings (Patreon). - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 87/16/69/.274/.330/.427/26

59) Echedry Vargas - MIA, SS, 20.1 - Vargas has been ripping up rookie ball for the last 2 years, and in his first taste of full season ball, he just kept on producing, slashing .276/.321/.454 with 14 homers, 29 steals, and a 21.1/5.0 K%/BB% in 97 games. It was good for a 125 wRC+. As you can see from that low walk rate, he chases a ton, and it gives him plenty of risk as he climbs the minor league ladder. He also isn't the type to jump off the screen with huge size or eye popping athleticism, but he can hit the ball hard, he can lift it, he can pull it, and he has speed. He's done nothing but produce in his career, and he generally has a good feel to hit. It might not end up the highest upside profile, but he has the potential to be an across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 72/19/77/.252/.317/.426/16

60) Roderick Arias - NYY, SS/2B, 20.7 - Arias was one of the top bets to go full elite prospect status in 2024, and it's good reminder that even though it can feel like a rookie ball prospect is inevitable, they aren't actually inevitable. There is a lot of inherent risk if you haven't even hit full season ball yet. Arias struggled to adjust for the first 3+ months of the season with a .652 OPS and 34.9% K%, but he finally found his groove in the final 2 months, giving hope that the big prospect breakout can still happen in 2025. In his final 47 games he slashed .276/.390/.471 with 7 homers, 16 steals, and a 24.4/14.6 K%/BB%. The strikeout rate has been high throughout his career, so there is definitely hit tool risk here, but he hits the ball hard, he has speed and he gets on base. I don't think it's fair to expect a truly elite prospect breakout anymore. You are really aiming for those rocket ships with little to no bumps in the road, and that isn't quite Arias. But just because his stock took a hit, doesn't mean he's not a really talented prospect. Just more of a Top 100-150 one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/77/.247/.326/.442/23

61) Willi Castro - MIN, OF/3B/2B/SS, 27.11 - Castro is a super utility player who was an overall positive on defense (+3.9 Fangraphs value), he hits at the top of the order, scoring 89 runs, and he amassed a ton of at bats with 635 PA. The nature of his everyday role feels a bit precarious long term, but short term it does seem likely he will get a ton of at bats again. He wasn't able to maintain his outlier steal season in 2023 (33 steals), coming back down to earth with 14 in 23 attempts, and he doesn't hit for much power (12 homers with a 87.4 MPH EV) or hit for a high BA (.247 BA with a 23.6% K%). He's optimally getting more like 400-500 PA per season, and not 600+, but right now, it does seem like his path to 600+ is still there. I'm not too intrigued by him in dynasty except in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 77/13/58/.250/.330/.397/17

62) Chase Meidroth - CHW, 2B/3B/SS, 23.9 - Meidroth was part of the return for Garrett Crochet, and if Chicago didn't think he has a very good chance of being a starting caliber player, why would they even want him included. It sure feels like he's the favorite for the starting 2B job right out of the gate, which is a big boost to his value. Unfortunately, that big boost still doesn't boost him very high in my book. The power is lacking with only 7 homers, a 5 degree launch, and a 2.2% Barrel% in 122 games at Triple-A, and so is the speed with 13 steals in 19 attempts. An elite plate approach is his game with a 12.7/18.8 K%/BB%, which led to a .293 BA, .437 OBP, and a 132 wRC+. His 88.6 MPH EV also isn't bad, so while it hasn't led to homers, it could be good enough to maintain the high BA/OBP on the MLB level. If he were potentially hitting atop a really good lineup, I could see real fantasy value here, but in the White Sox lineup, the fantasy value is likely to be lacking for the next few seasons. I can see a path to a solid fantasy player, but it's not a journey I'm looking to go on. - 2025 Projection: 63/11/49/.255/.320/.386/7 Prime Projection: 84/15/61/.276/.352/.416/9

63) George Lombard - NYY, SS, 19.10 - Lombard's hit tool was not as good as hoped in his first full year of pro ball with a 24% K% and .232 BA in 81 games at Single-A, and then a 19.8% K% and .226 BA in 29 games at High-A. A large chunk of his value was coming from that hit tool, because he doesn't have big present power with only 5 homers in 110 games. The launch and approach are geared more for line drives than homers, so it's not just about gaining more power naturally, which he will. He has good tools at 6'3'', 190 pounds and there is definitely room to tack on more mass. He's also fast and a good baserunner with 39 steals. He has a mature approach (12.3% BB% with a .338 OBP), he's a good defensive SS, and he's young for his class at a still 19 years old as of 2025 Opening Day. There is potential for him to be an above average across the board player at peak, but he's going to have to show real hit tool gains pretty soon, or a major power increase if he doesn't want the profile to start looking a bit lackluster. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/17/69/.259/.324/.419/23

64) Edwin Arroyo - CIN, SS, 21.7 - Arroyo underwent shoulder surgery in late March and missed all of 2024, but he made it back for the AFL, so he should be able to have a completely normal off-season and be 100% healthy for 2025. Granted, he didn't hit very well in the AFL with a .642 OPS in 18 games, but he's 2.2 years younger than average, and this is basically his spring training coming off a major surgery. I would only take it as a positive that he is even playing in the league. He’s a switch hitter who hits well from both sides of the plate, he has plus speed, and at a pretty skinny 5'11”, there is definitely room for him to add more power. The hit tool and approach aren't quite good enough to get really excited for this type of profile, but if he can add real power, there is definitely potential for him to put up some super impactful fantasy seasons hitting in Cincinnati. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/17/64/.253/.320/.426/25

65) Tai Peete - SEA, SS/OF/3B, 19.7 - Tai Peete is the same age as many of the high schoolers in the 2024 Draft (he's 1 month younger than Bryce Rainer), and his pure talent can rival any of them (maybe not Konnor Griffin's, but everyone else's). He also already has a pretty strong season at Single-A under his belt with a .269/.343/.408 triple-slash in 115 games. That is a pretty good slash for an 18 year old in full season ball. He hit only 7 homers, but all 7 of them came in his final 59 games, which is the improvement you want to see from a young player as the season goes along. And he has no joke raw power at 6'2'', 193 pounds, so there is a lot more of that coming. He's a really good athlete and he displayed elite base stealing ability with 45 steals in 50 attempts. What I'm trying to say, is that Peete is getting mighty underrated right now. I understand why he's getting rated so low, because the hit tool is a legit problem with a 30.7% K%, but he walked 10.4% of the time too, and you have to take into account his young age for the level. There is definitely still a lot of rawness to his game, but he performed pretty well despite that rawness, so imagine what he can do as he starts to refine his game. I aim for upside in fantasy, and Peete is all upside. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/75/.247/.323/.432/26

66) Staryln Caba - MIA, SS, 19.4 - Caba is a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect with an elite glove at SS and little to no raw or game power, but that doesn't mean he isn't enticing at all for fantasy. His plate skills are elite with both plus contact rates and a plus approach. He put up a 14.4/19.7 K%/BB% in 78 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A. He's also a plus runner who loves to steal with 50 steals in 62 attempts. If he can make enough impact to the baseball, he could be a potent top of the order hitter with BA, OBP and tons of steals. But how much impact he will make is the question. He's not a big guy at 5'10'', he doesn't hit the ball hard with a 83.7 MPH EV at Single-A, and his ground ball rate was around 50%. He's young and has time to get bigger and add power, but just how much he can get to is the question. Guys like Caba generally top out at around Top 75-ish fantasy prospects for me when they are knocking on the door of the bigs, and since Caba isn't knocking on the door of the bigs, he's more of a Top 150-ish prospect. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/12/51/.284/.353/.395/34

67) Angel Genoa - CLE, SS, 20.10 - Genoa will rank higher on real life lists because he has a good glove at SS and a solid all around offensive game, but he's not nearly as exciting for fantasy. The reason I even have him ranked this high is because getting ranked highly on real life lists boosts fantasy trade value, whether rightly or wrongly, and having a good glove also gets you on the field. Opportunity and leash is a big factor for success, and Genoa's glove should give him that. And it's not like he's a zero on offense at all. He slashed .330/.379/.499 with 10 homers, 25 steals, and a 15.5/7.7 K%/BB% in 110 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's a 6 foot switch hitter who should get to average power at peak, and while he's not a burner, he should contribute in steals as well. He's a solid but unspectacular across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/17/74/.268/.323/.428/17

68) David Hamilton - BOS, SS/2B, 27.6 - If I was more certain that Hamilton truly had a stable full time job, I could see liking him a ton for fantasy, but I think Boston views him more as a heavily used utility player, which limits how high I'm willing to go. Kristian Campbell could conceivably win the 2B job out of camp, and Marcelo Mayer is coming soon too. There is just too much competition, and quite frankly, Hamilton just isn't a good enough real life hitter to stave them off. He has a career 85 wRC+ in 113 career MLB games, and he had a 92 wRC+ in 98 games in 2024. He's a solid middle infielder, but he's not so good that his glove is going to truly force him on the field. The last negative is that the hit tool isn't good enough for this type of profile with a .248 BA and 25.2/6.9 K%/BB%. He's a straight demon on the bases with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint and 33 steals (in 98 games), so he can make a fantasy impact in daily moves leagues even without a full time job, and his 5.6% Barrel% isn't bad, so he can pop some dingers too (8 homers), but I just don't see a full time player here long term. - 2025 Projection: 48/8/33/.244/.309/.398/26

69) Max Muncy - OAK, SS, 22.7 - Muncy cracks the 3B list too because there are rumors he could be competing for that open job. Considering he was the 25th overall pick in the 2021 Draft, he's been flying super low under the radar despite strong minor league results throughout his career, especially when you consider age to level. Oakland has been relatively aggressive with him, and he's responded to the challenge every single time, culminating with him putting up a 117 wRC+ in 50 games at Triple-A in his age 21 year old season this year. He doesn't have a standout area in his game, which is likely why the hype has been so quiet, but he's just a good all around player with 8 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.6/8.9 K%/BB%. He has about average power right now which should only tick up in the next few years, he's a very good athlete who should contribute in steals, and he's known as a good defensive SS, so his glove should help him get on the field The strikeout rates have been high throughout his career and there is definitely hit tool risk, so that combined with the fact he doesn't really have standout power or speed makes me hesitant to go higher than this. He still feels underrated to me though. - 2025 Projection: 36/9/43/.226/.289/.392/7 Prime Projection: 72/20/77/.248/.321/.435/12

70) Joswa Lugo - LAA, SS, 18.2 - Lugo signed for $2.3 million in last year's international class with the big tools to back it up at 6'3'', and then he went out and impressed in the DSL, slashing .301/.370/.466 with 5 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.3/7.8 K%/BB% in 53 games. He has power potential written all over him with a smooth and quick righty swing that already packs a major punch. He had no groundball issues with a 35.3% GB%, so he should be able to get to all of his power at peak. He's also a really good athlete who is currently at SS, so while he's likely to fill out and slow down over time, he should be at least be a contributor in stolen bases, along with a possible asset with the glove (or at least not a total nothing). The biggest red flag is that the K/BB rates were pretty weak against DSL competition, so there is still a ton of risk present here, but if he performs well when he comes stateside, he has the type of talent that can explode in a hurry. He's one of my favorite DSL breakouts. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/26/86/.251/.321/.471/12

71) Kellon Lindsey - LAD, SS, 19.6 - Selected 23rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, elite speed is the the 6'0'', 175 pound Lindsey's calling card, and it comes with a good glove at SS and a good feel to hit. There isn't big power in here, and while that should tick up over time, he doesn't really project for big power down the line either. The hit tool is solid, but it's not really in that near elite range and there is some risk with how it will perform against more advanced pitching. He's an excellent athlete who played QB and DB in high school, so there is plenty of upside in here, but going after a speed first guy without huge power and with a good but not great hit tool I think warrants some caution. I know getting drafted by LA and getting Trea Turner comps is exciting, but I'm not sure I'm reaching for Lindsey quite yet. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/15/66/.270/.328/.420/31

72) Tyson Lewis - CIN, SS, 19.3 -  Selected 51st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'2'', 195 pound Lewis is a high upside high school bat with at least plus speed, plus power potential, and a quick and powerful lefty swing. He's not the most refined high school bat, just recently undergoing a swing overhaul, and there are also some hit tool questions as he faces more advanced pitching. On pure upside, he rivals or surpasses Theo Gillen, but his bat isn't as safe and he's just not as refined. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 80/20/78/.259/.322/.438/23

73) Caleb Bonemer - CHW, SS, 19.6 - Selected 39th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bonemer has one of the top power/speed combos in the high school class with plus run times and electric bat speed. He's performed against advanced competition and has a good feel to hit. He doesn't have the smoothest batting stance/swing, which adds some hit tool risk, and he's not one of those obvious giant human beings with a 6'1'', 195 pound frame, but he's far from small. He's a big, physical guy. He's an excellent upside pick who should come at a reasonable price. I like Bonemer a lot - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 80/20/80/.256/.325/.440/20

74) Josuar Gonzalez - SFG, SS, 17.6 - Gonzalez is expected to sign for one of the top bonuses in the class, and he earned that bonus by being a great athlete and doing everything well on the baseball field. He's not a huge guy at 5'10'', 170 pounds, so he's more in the mold of a Jesus Made than a Emil Morales to use two comps from last years class. Of course, that is if everything goes right. If everything doesn't go right, he's more in the mold of a Fernando Cruz or Brando Mayea. He's a switch hitter who looks super smooth, explosive and locked in at the dish. He has a good feel to hit, approach, he can hit it hard, he's fast, and he has a good glove. He's not one of those overtly physical prospects that I really love sticking my neck out for, so I'm not going to fly him up my rankings, but he's definitely exciting. I've been going back and forth in my mind if I prefer the 2nd tier of high school bats from the MLB draft class, or the top tier of international bats, and right now I'm leaning draft bats. But it's close. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 88/18/62/.277/.342/.421/28

75) Elian Pena - NYM, SS, 17.6 - Pena is expected to sign for the top bonus in the class (non Roki Sasaki division), and when you watch his lefty swing, it's easy to see why he has a potentially very exciting hit/power combo. He's only 5'10'', but he already has that sturdy trunk and hard hit ability that portends him being a bruiser in the box. And he combines that power potential with a good feel to hit and excellent approach. I definitely see the middle of the order masher potential, but like Josuar Gonzalez, I'm not sure I'm so blown away that I really want to stick my neck out for him. I'll take him if the price is right, but I'm not going to reach. Maybe I'm being too conservative at the moment, but that is how I would play it right now. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 86/26/91/.273/.348/.475/10

76) Brayan Rocchio - CLE, SS, 24.3 - I've been calling Rocchio a sell for a few years now as he was getting Top 100 Prospect love (and actually like Top 20 prospect love on some lists), and after his rough rookie year in 2024, any trade value he had left is probably gone. He slashed .206/.298/.316 with 8 homers, 10 steals, and a 20.4/10.0 K%/BB% in 143 games. The .275 xwOBA backs up the terrible surface stats. He has a good SS glove, the plate approach is solid, and he he seems to have a lock on the starting SS job, but with an 84.6 MPH EV, 26.8 ft/sec sprint, and 69.5 MPH swing, there really isn't all that much hope for an impact fantasy player. Maybe he can put together some .260/15/15 seasons at peak, but even that would be a high end outcome. - 2025 Projection: 68/11/51/.237/.313/.362/12

77) Thomas Saggese - STL, 2B/3B/SS, 23.0 - Saggese was always a guy who produced above his tools, demanding respect in the prospect world despite being a 5th round pick, but pro ball finally caught up with him at Triple-A. He put up 93 wRC+ with a 23.1/5.9 K%/BB% in 125 games. He then got a cup of coffee in the majors where he struggled hard with a 57 wRC+ and 26.9/3.8 K%/BB% in 52 PA. He just doesn't hit the ball hard enough (87.3 MPH at AAA and 85.7 MPH in the majors), or have good enough plate skills (see K/BB above), or run enough (9 steals) to be too enticing of a fantasy prospect. There also isn't much defensive value, so it's not like the glove will force him on the field. I'm not saying he can't be a solid bat at peak, because I think he can be, I'm just not too enthused about rostering him until it maybe happens. - 2025 Projection: 25/5/29/.237/.293/.389/2 Prime Projection: 66/19/74/.259/.318/.420/8

78) Marco Luciano - SFG, SS/2B, 23.7 - Luciano's prospect star has slowly faded as he's continued to climb the ladder, and it came to a head in 2024 with a terrible year in the majors, and also a very mediocre year at Triple-A. He put up a 59 wRC+ with a 34.6/6.2 K%/BB%, 0 homers, and 0 steals in 81 MLB PA. And at AAA he slashed .250/.380/.380 in 83 games. He's not good on defense, the hit tool is below average at best, and he's not fast with average speed. Power was always his main selling point, and that is still present with a plus 73.7 MPH swing and 89.8 MPH EV at Triple-A, but the launch is relatively low, he doesn't particularly pull it a ton, and SF is just a deadly ballpark for power hitters. He's also been passed on the depth chart, so he doesn't have a clear path to playing time at the moment. Without much defensive value, hit tool problems, little speed, no starting job, and good but not great power, I just don't see him as a very unique or valuable player right now. He's still on the radar, he has legit power, and he's young, so I'm not giving up on him completely, but this is as high as I can go. - 2025 Projection: 28/7/24/.234/.310/.400/2 Prime Projection: 68/24/73/.248/.322/437/6

79) Jefferson Rojas - CHC, SS, 19.11 - I was a bit lower on Rojas than consensus last off-season, because I just didn't see big enough tools to get really excited about him for fantasy, and that played out in 2024 with a mediocre season. He hit 6 homers with 21 steals (in 29 attempts) and a 88 wRC+ in 96 games at High-A. We have to grade on a curve because he was young for the level, and the 15.3% K% was excellent, so it's not like it was a terrible year or anything, it just displayed that he's a better real life prospect than a fantasy one. He can play SS and he gets the ball on the ball, which gives him a very high floor, but the power/speed combo projects to be moderate at best. He's a solid fantasy prospect, but not a truly coveted one at the moment. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/17/71/.273/.326/.421/15

80) Kaelen Culpepper - MIN, SS, 22.3 -  Selected 21st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 185 pound Culpepper is a proven college performer with solid across the board skills. He slashed .328/.419/.547 with 11 homers, 17 steals, and a 14.1%/12.0% K%/BB% in 61 games in the Big 12. He reminds me a lot of Minnesota's 2nd round pick in 2023, Luke Keaschall, who has similar size, speed, and feel to hit. Nothing jumps off the screen, but they get the job done in all facets of the game. Minnesota has had a lot of success with Keaschall, and Culpepper looks to be next with his strong pro debut. He cracked 3 homers with 4 steals, and a 13.4/9.8 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's a nice little "let him come to you" target in off-season prospect drafts right now. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/16/72/.268/.330/.420/18

81) Jesus Baez - NYM, SS/3B, 20.1 - Baez' season ended on July 3rd after undergoing knee surgery for a torn meniscus, but he has showing off a very impressive hit/power combo before going down with the injury. He cracked 10 homers with a 15.7 degree launch, 16.2% K% and 123 wRC+ in 64 games at Single-A, and then he snuck in 8 games at High-A where he proved everything will transfer with 1 homer, a 15.6% K% and a 119 wRC+. He's not a huge tools guy at 5'10'', but he's powerfully built and he surely has a powerful righty swing with a 89.7 MPH EV. He's not particularly projectable and the plate approach isn't great, so it might be someone who sees his production drop, or maintain, as he gets to higher levels, rather than someone who just keeps on improving. I think a reasonable upside projection for him would be an above average hit/power combo, rather than a truly special one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 71/24/79/.263/.321/.441/7

82) Austin Charles - KCR, 3B/SS, 21.4 - Charles was a super raw, super talented project at an uber athletic 6'5'' coming into 2024, and he more or less heads into 2025 with that exact same profile. He was 20 years old and repeating Single-A, which is never a great sign, and while he had a much better season this year with a 121 wRC+, the .257/.353/.386 triple slash with a 25.8% K% and 10 homers in 117 games doesn't exactly look great. You only have to watch him swing the bat once with an insanely athletic, quick, and powerful righty swing to overlook the lackluster statistical profile, and he can certainly lift and pull it with a 35.2% GB% and 60.1% Pull%, so he should be able to get to most of his power down the line. He also has plus speed with 36 steals. The real question is the hit tool, and while it seems the odds are against him hitting enough to be a full time regular, the upside would be considerable if he can figure it out. He continues to hover in that Top 200-ish area for me as a high risk, high reward lotto ticket. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/18/74/.233/.308/.423/19

83) Jhonny Severino - PIT, SS.3B, 20.5 - You only have to watch Severino demolish a homer to completely get his appeal. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 185 pounds with that absolute vicious and athletic righty swing that jacked out 16 homers in 84 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A (6 homers in 28 games at Single-A). He's also a good athlete who stole 16 bags in 20 attempts. He was a 19 year old at rookie ball for his first 56 games of the season, so I was a little skeptical of the 15.9/11.8 K%/BB% at that level, and that skepticism proved correct as he put up a much worse 30.1/6.5 K%/BB% at the more age appropriate Single-A. There is definitely risk with much more refinement needed, but the upside is easy to dream on. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 75/24/82/.242/.313/.448/12

84) Jose Caballero - TBR, 2B/SS/3B, 28.7 - Carson Williams is going to take over Tampa's SS job sooner rather than later, which is going to relegate Caballero to his rightful role as a utility player. He's terrible on offense with a 83 wRC+, .267 xwOBA, an 83.7 MPH EV and a 27.5/5.6 K%/BB% in 139 games. He's good on defense, but he's not that good to overcome that offense. He's a great base stealer, racking up 44 steals, which is the sole area where he derives his fantasy value. He's a bench role player for deep leagues. - 2025 Projection: 48/8/39/.233/.299/.352/26

85) Jeremy Rodriguez - NYM, SS, 18.9 - Rodriguez was one of the top high-floor DSL breakouts in 2023, and he remains a high floor prospect after a solid showing in stateside rookie ball, slashing .282/.355/.400 with 3 homers, 17 steals, and a 17.1/9.7 K%/BB% in 50 games. If you want to get a little crazy with the comp, his swing reminds me more than a bit of Francisco Lindor's, and Rodriguez is basically the same size with the same skillset. Lindor's power was also undersold as a prospect. But Lindor is obviously the stupid ceiling comp. You can also find utility infielders with similar profiles and size. You get the point. He gets the bat on the ball, he's 6'0'' with room for muscle, he's a good athlete, and he has a good glove. He's probably a bit underrated right now if anything. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/17/60/.269/.331/.413/20

86) John Gil - ATL, SS/3B, 18.10 - Gil is a pretty toolsy and projectable 6'1'', 175 pounds, and he's now conquered both levels of rookie ball, putting up a 120 wRC+ in 48 games in the DSL in 2023, and then putting up a 124 wRC+ with 3 homers, 26 steals, and a 16.1/13.3 K%/BB% in 51 games at stateside rookie ball in 2024. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 72 wRC+ in 39 games, but he was barely 18 years old, and the 23.3/11.9 K%/BB% with 14 steals wasn't bat at all. There is definitely room to tack on more mass, and he was lifting and pulling in rookie ball, so he should be able to get to most of his eventual raw power. Gil checks a lot of boxes for a rookie ball player with contact, approach, speed, athleticism, good size, and projection. He's a definite legit breakout candidate in 2025. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/16/58/.273/.336/.419/26

87) Luis Pena - MIL, SS/3B/SS, 18.4 - Pena was the top hit/speed combo breakout in the DSL, slashing .393/.457/.583 with 1 homer, 39 steals, and a 8.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 44 games. He's not a big guy at a relatively skinny 5'11'', but he has an explosive righty swing that can hit the ball hard, there is plenty of room to tack on mass, and he doesn't have any major lift and pull problems, so there is definitely potential for him to develop some level of real power down the line. If he can, that makes for a pretty exciting prospect with contact, speed and power. If he can't, there should still be enough impact there for him to be a enticing hit/speed prospect. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 82/15/64/.272/.331/.425/28

88) Jhonny Level - SFG, SS, 18.0 - Level signed for $1 million in last year's international class, and he then went on to decimate the DSL, slashing .275/.393/.517 with 10 homers, 18 steals, and a 16.7/14.0 K%/BB% in 48 games. He doesn't necessarily have the scouts dream body you can really project on to fly him up rankings, but he's a rock solid and athletic 5'10'', which can certainly work. He excelled in all facets of the game, and while there might not be a true standout tool when he gets to higher levels, he very well might have enough juice to stay very productive across the board. I wouldn't stick my neck out too much, but he's definitely one of my favorite DSL breakouts. He's a fun one. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 81/21/79/.268/.332/.437/15

89) Yolfran Castillo - TEX, SS, 18.2 - Castillo obliterated the DSL with a 8.2%/22.7% K%/BB%, 6 steals, and a 188 wRC+ in 20 games before Texas showed how much they liked the kid by calling him up to stateside rookie. He proved the profile will transfer there too with a 10.6% K% and 4 steals in 15 games. He didn't hit a homer this year, but he's a projectable 6'3'' with good bat speed, so more power is certainly coming down the line. He signed for a solid $647,500, and with how quick Texas promoted him, they are tipping their hand as to how much they value him. He has both floor (elite contact rates with a good glove) and upside (size, projection and athleticism). He's definitely a good target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 85/18/71/.278/.343/.428/18

90) Luke Dickerson - WAS, SS, 19.8 - Selected 44th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 190 Dickerson is a strong kid who won a state championship as as hockey player. You can see that toughness in the box with a powerful righty swing, and he combines that with good athleticism and speed. He signed for $3.8 million, which was the 21st highest signing bonus in the class and tells you how much Washington loved this kid. I do prefer a few other high school bats that got drafted in that 2nd round area over Dickerson, but it's hard to argue with that signing bonus, and his talent is right there with them. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.260/.330/.440/15

91) Tytus Cissell - ARI, SS, 19.0 - Selected 132nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for $800,000, Cissell was a late riser in the draft process, and sometimes those guys that pop up later in the process can have a lag on their value, which is what Arizona is hoping for after they swiped him in the 4th round. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with an absolutely vicious swing. He's a switch hitter and the swing is smoother from the left, but it's truly vicious from both sides. He's also a plus runner and athlete with a good up the middle glove. The hit tool isn't a lock, but if he manages solid contact rates in pro ball, his stock could fly in a hurry. He's definitely an enticing later round target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/19/72/.250/.322/.427/21

92) Dorian Soto - BOS, SS, 17.1 - Soto is the type of international prospect that I love to target. He's not the most hyped guy in his class, but he has that prototypical size at a projectable 6'3'', 185 pounds, and his swing jumps off the screen as uber quick and powerful. He already has big time power and it could end up double plus at peak depending on how he fills out. He's a good athlete but isn't considered a burner, and while he's known to have a solid hit tool and approach, I'm thinking there could be some hit tool risk in here looking at the swing. If he were faster, I might really, really love him, but as is I still really like him as an upside target. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 79/28/88/.250/.322/.469/13

93) Elvin Garcia - BAL, SS, 18.2 - Garcia was a talented international prospect who signed for half a million, and then he went out and produced in the DSL, slashing .294/.439/.505 with 1 homer, 12 steals and a 18.0/19.4 K%/BB% in 36 games. It was good for a 154 wRC+. He's a projectable 6'2'' and he didn't have any groundball issues, so the homer power should come in time, which he will combine with a good feel to hit, speed, and a good glove. With a good showing stateside, and with an uptick in power, he might have the highest real life prospect helium upside of anyone in the Baltimore system outside of Mayo, Basallo, and Kjerstad. He's a good later round target if you can handle the risk. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 78/17/71/.266/.325/.421/23

94) Wyatt Sanford - PIT, SS, 19.4 - Selected 47th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Sanford has baseball bloodlines with his dad playing 19 games in the bigs, and like most baseball bloodlines kids, you can tell. He has a plus SS glove with a natural lefty swing, good feel to hit, and plus speed. While the swing is smooth, the stance isn't all that smooth and is geared more for contact than power. The 6'1'', 185 pound frame definitely has room to tack on more mass, but he's not expected to be a big power hitter down the line. There is a nice combination of floor and upside here, but both the floor and upside aren't quite high enough for me to rank higher than this. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/17/70/.268/.331/.4247/25

95) JD Dix - ARI, SS, 19.6 - Selected 35th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Dix is a 6'2'', 180 pound SS with a simple and quick swing from both sides of the plate, developing power, and some speed. The hit tool is the most standout tool right now, profiling as a solid across the board type at peak. There really isn't anything too remarkable about his profile. Just your classic really good high school prospect with good size, good feel to hit, and good overall athleticism. He's good. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 79/18/72/.273/.338/.429/16

96) Shotaro Morii - OAK, SS/RHP, 18.4 - Morii is the rare Japanese player to come stateside right out of high school, which I think adds some extra intrigue to his profile. He's a two way player with upside on both the mound and at the plate, so it's hard to say where he's going to end up. I'll start with the bat, which I'm pretty damn excited about. He has a vicious lefty swing with quickness, power, and barrel control from a pretty built 6'1'', 180 pound frame. He hit 45 homers in high school. He reminds me a bit of Hideki Matsui if you are looking for a ceiling comp. On the mound he gets up to 95 MPH with a splitter, slider and curve that all need more development. I hope he sticks as a bat, but he has two real paths to be an impact prospect. I'm a fan. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 78/24/83/.268/.333/.445/9

97) David Coronil - SDP, SS, 17.6 - Coronil could sneakily be my favorite international prospect in this SS class. He has that nearly perfect long, lean, and projectable frame at 6'3'', 175 pounds, and he has that smooth and athletic lefty swing that is easy to dream on. If he tacks on more mass while retaining that athleticism, we could be talking about a prototypical hyped prospect here with power, speed and feel to hit. Lastly, he has one of the best SS gloves in the class, which will be a big help to his real life hype. He's definitely one of my top targets in the international class. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 80/20/80/.255/.328/.436/20

98) Walker Martin - SFG, SS, 21.1 - Martin put up a 46.3% K% in 25 games at Single-A after putting up a 37.6% K% in 44 games at rookie ball. As a 20 year old, those K rates are really enough for him to not crack this list, but his talent demands we stay patient for at least one more year. He has a damn smooth, athletic and powerful lefty swing at 6'2'', 188 pounds that most certainly looks the part of a major leaguer. Even with the high strikeout rates, he still performed pretty well with 8 homers, 6 steals, a .391 OBP, and a 108 wRC+ on the season. He was considered a bit more on the raw side when he was drafted, so some of this hit tool risk was expected. He's clearly never going to be an "age to level" guy, but his talent isn't going anywhere, and if he can figure out the hit tool in his mid 20's, there could be a big payoff here. I'm inclined to buy super low, but make sure the price is actually super low. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/23/78/.235/.318/.434/14

99) J.P. Crawford - SEA, SS, 30.2 - While Crawford wasn't able to fully maintain his power breakout from 2023 (19 homers), he actually was able to maintain a large chunk of it, hitting 9 homers in 105 games, which would have put him on pace for the 2nd most homers in his career if he didn't miss time with a fractured finger. His 6.5% Barrel% was also a career high by far. He definitely has grown into more power towards the mid to later stages of his career here. It has come at the cost of some contact though, putting up a 5 year worst 22.6% K% and 20.2% whiff%. His hit tool also bottomed out with a .202 BA, and while some of hit was certainly back luck, not all of it was with a .227 BA. His .245 career BA isn't very good, he still doesn't have more than mid teens power even with the uptick, and he barely runs. Add a star in OBP leagues as he walks a lot, but this is just a very low upside player who might not be a starter for that much longer. - 2025 Projection: 82/14/55/.245/.338/.391/5

100) Orlando Arcia - ATL, SS, 30.8 - Arcia put up a 72 wRC+ with a .218 BA in 157 games, and while some of it was bad luck with a .249 BABIP, the .261 xwOBA and career 78 wRC+ shows it really wasn't all that much of an outlier season. It does strike me as a definite down year, and he should bounce back in 2025, but this is a very low end option with mid teens pop and that is about it. He doesn't hit for a good average, he doesn't run, and he doesn't walk all that much. - 2025 Projection: 69/16/67/.239/.304/.402/2

101) Geraldo Perdomo - ARI, SS, 25.4 - I know that Perdomo has a good glove at SS, and I know he is a clubhouse leader, but I still think he's just keeping the seat warm for Jordan Lawlar. I don't think his bat is good enough to be an MLB starter long term with a .281 xwOBA in 98 games. But having said that, there are some strings you can pull out to hope for future offensive improvement. For one, his surface stats beat his underlying numbers with a 98 wRC+ in 2023 and a 101 wRC+ in 2024. His contact rates are near elite with a 14.9% K%, and he has a good approach too with a 9.3% BB%. If he can start to hit the ball a bit harder as he gets into his mid 20's, I guess it's possible for his bat to be just good enough to be a starting SS, but I don't think good teams want just good enough. They want Jordan Lawlar, and I think Lawlar is coming to take this job. Even if Perdomo does hold him off and hits his peak, the upside just isn't there without power or speed. - 2025 Projection: 74/9/49/.255/.329/.382/14

102) Josh Smith - TEX, 3B/SS, 27.7 - Smith is a super utility player who optimally doesn't play everyday, but he could be next man up at several positions, so injuries/ineffectiveness could end up forcing him into near everyday at bats like it did in 2024. He's the epitome of a good bench player with a solid glove, a solid plate approach (20.4/7.8 K%/BB%), a solid EV (87.8 MPH EV), and solid speed (27.6 ft/sec sprint). It resulted in a .258 BA with 13 homers and 11 steals. The deeper the league, the more value he would have. - 2025 Projection: 57/12/53/.249/.326/.395/9

103) Dylan Moore - SEA, SS/3B/2B/OF, 32.8 - Moore is a heavily used utility player whose most valuable format would be a deeper OBP, daily moves league. There is value in here if you can start him vs. lefites (.762 OPS vs .639 OPS vs. righties). He stole 32 bags in 441 PA, which is where he derives most of his value, and he can also pop some dingers with a 8.8% Barrel% and 22.6 degree launch, leading to 10 homers. The hit tool is brutal with a career .206 BA (.201 in 2024), but the .316 OBP is where he can be decent in OBP leagues. He currently has a full time job, but let's see what Seattle does the rest of the off-season. Even with a full time job, he's still just a medium to deep league role player. - 2025 Projection: 59/14/48/.210/.315/.396/28

104) Brooks Baldwin - CHW, 2B/SS, 24.7 - Colson Montgomery is going to take the starting SS job sooner rather than later, but if Chicago slow plays it, or if he struggles hard, Baldwin could be their best option at SS at the moment, and he has the speed to be fantasy relevant. He has a 29.1 ft/sec sprint and he stole 17 bags in 82 games in the upper minors, and then 4 bags in 33 games in the majors. He doesn't have big raw power with an 87.4 MPH EV, but he puts it in the air a ton with a 26.2 launch, so he can pop some dingers. It's certainly a fun homer/steal combo for fantasy, but the plate approach isn't good (25.6/5.0 K%/BB%), and he doesn't hit the ball hard to take advantage of the flyball rates, so it's a recipe for a super low BA (.211 BA). He's likely a utility infielder long term, but one with some fantasy upside. - 2025 Projection: 41/11/41/.227/.290/.393/14

105) Darell Hernaiz - OAK, 3B/SS, 23.8 - There are rumors Max Muncy could be considered for the 3B job, which tells me that Oakland optimally sees Hernaiz as a utility infielder long term with Muncy, Wilson, and Gelof as the starters, but just because that's the plan, doesn't mean it's going to work out that way. And Hernaiz is good enough to keep the pressure on all 3 of those guys, slashing .333/.376/.493 with 5 homers, 6 steals, and a 14.0/7.6 K%/BB% in 35 games at Triple-A. He struggled hard in the majors with a 50 wRC+, but a 20.0/8.1 K%/BB% with a 87.1 MPH EV isn't that bad. The launch is low and the 27.5 ft/sec sprint is slightly above average, so we aren't talking about a big talent here, but the guy can hit. If he does find himself with full time at bats, he could put up average across the board numbers. - 2025 Projection: 21/3/18/.248/.291/.353/6 Prime Projection: 68/12/51/.266/.324/.388/11

106) Nacho Alvarez - ATL, SS/3B/2B, 22.0 - Nobody is a bigger Nacho fan than me. I named him a super deep sleeper in his FYPD class for deep leagues, and seeing him blossom has been fun to watch, but unfortunately, he's still really only a deep league option. The power/speed combo is just far too lackluster with an 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A and below average speed. He's also not a lift and pull guy, so he can't fall back on that either. The hit tool and plate approach are great with a 15.6/12.8 K%/BB% at Triple-A, but that immediately didn't transfer to the majors with a 31.3/0.0 K%/BB% in 32 PA. He was 21 and it's a super small sample, so I'm not giving it too much credence, but considering the below average power/speed combo, that hit tool/approach needs to be bulletproof. It sure looks like a utility player to me, or a low end regular. - 2025 Projection: 11/2/13/.248/.297/.353/2 Prime Projection: 76/13/62/.276/.338/.411/10

107) Carson DeMartini - PHI, 3B/SS, 22.3 - Selected 130th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, DeMartini was a pro debut breakout, and you know how much I love my pro debut breakouts. He slashed .315/.385/.478 with 2 homers, 8 steals, and a 13.5/8.7 K%/BB% in 24 games at Single-A. And it's not like he wasn't an absolute beast in his amateur career too. He put up a 1.110 OPS his freshman year in the ACC, a 1.048 OPS his sophomore year, and a 1.072 OPS with 21 homers in 54 games his junior year. He's not a huge guy at 6'0'', 197 pounds, but he can hit it hard enough, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's also not a burner, but he knows how to steal a bag. The reason he got drafted so late is that he had a 27.7% K% this year in college, but it came with a 16.8% BB%, and it was much better his sophomore year with a 17.1% K%, so it's not like he has some definite fatal flaw there. The fact that he had a 13.5% K% in his pro debut is also a great sign. He might not be a world beater, but DeMartini is a very, very interesting later round college bat for deeper leagues. He's a definite target late in the draft. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/18/69/.253/.321/.422/12

108) Jack Brannigan - PIT, 3B/SS, 24.1 - Brannigan was a 23 year old at Single-A who had a .238 BA with a 26.1% K%. Odds are the hit tool isn't going to be good enough to be an MLB starter, bit if he can make real improvements to the hit tool, the upside is high enough for him to make an impact. Think something like a Luke Raley type career arc, where he breaks out when he's in his late 20's, but you're still not quite sure if he truly has a lock on a full time job. And like Raley, Brannigan has that type of power/speed combo with 18 homers and 12 steals in 77 games. He can lift and pull, he can hit the ball hard, he's a good athlete, and he has a decent infield glove too. He fits nicely into that reasonably priced, high upside bucket of prospect where you don't have to wait 5 years to see what you have. You will know pretty quickly into 2025 once he hits the upper minors. I'm kinda liking him the more I'm thinking about him during this blurb, but the odds are still that he won't hit enough, a la Joey Wiemer. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.228/.311/.431/9

109) Ricardo Cabrera - CIN, 3B/2B/SS, 20.5 - I want to like Cabrera more, but a 83.9 MPH EV in 105 games at Single-A is super underwhelming. He was only 19, so I'm not saying he can't improve there, he almost certainly will, it's just a very low starting point, and it's hard to bet on him truly hitting the ball very hard in the future. It's also not like he was that great statistically, slashing .252/.333/..399 with 11 homers, 19 steals, and a 22.1/6.8 K%/BB%. He also had a 50.2% GB%. He was a high priced international signing who has hit well in pro ball, which is why I feel the pull to like him more, but objectively, he's just not that unique or special of a prospect. He's fine. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/15/71/.264/.322/.411/13

110) Jansel Luis - ARI, 3B/2B/SS, 20.1 - Luis was a breakout candidate coming into 2024, and while he didn't breakout, he did enough to stay on the future breakout radar. He slashed .265/.337/.414 with 7 homers, 20 steals, and a 20.8/7.6 K%/BB% in 109 games at Single-A. He's a pretty explosive player at 6'0'', 170 pounds with plenty of room to add more raw power down the line, but he's still raw in most aspects of his game. He needs to refine the hit tool, plate approach, base stealing, unlocking more game power and defense. It's a lot, but simply hitting the ball harder would cure a lot of ills and he should naturally hit the ball harder as he ages. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/62/.265/.321/.403/18

111) Carter Johnson - MIA, SS, 19.1 - Selected 56th overall, Johnson is a safe high school bat with plus hit as his best tool. Watching his super easy and smooth lefty swing reminds me of when I was evaluating Mickey Moniak in his draft year (Moniak went first overall, but I didn't have him even close to 1st overall on my FYPD Rankings). Let's hope he ends up better than Moniak though, whose hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball ... and spoiler alert (I wrote that above blurb before Johnson debuted), the hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball with a .221 BA and a 33.1% K% in 28 games at Single-A. He was thrown into the deep end at Single-A as an 18 year old, so I don't want to overrate that small sample, but considering I got visions of Moniak before the debut, it doesn't add confidence. Then tack on the fact that that he doesn't have a big power/speed combo (although at 6'2'', 180 pounds, the hope is that he can get to average power) and I don't trust the Marlins to develop him at all, it's just not the type of profile I like going after. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/17/68/.270/.325/.421/9

112) Kyle DeBarge - MIN, SS, 21.9 - Selected 33rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, DeBarge gets the little man discount at 5'9'', 175 pounds, and he gets the non major conference discount playing in the Sun Belt Conference, but he's a legitimately electric player with a lot to be excited about. He has an explosive righty swing that jacked out 21 homers in 62 games, he has a potentially plus hit tool with a 10.3% K%, he's got speed with 10 steals, and he's young for the class. I wish he had a better pro debut, because I might have went after him this off-season, but I was a little underwhelmed by the hit tool (.235 BA with a 24.3% K%) and power (1 homer in 26 games at Single-A). He wasn't a great base stealer in college, he didn't walk a ton, and his size does limit his ultimate power projection (0 homers in 25 games in the wood bat Cape Cod league as well), so it might not be a huge upside profile, but maybe I'm falling into the little man trap as well. Minnesota took him 33rd overall for a reason. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/16/69/.261/.321/.414/16

113) Cobb Hightower - SDP, SS, 20.0 - Selected 88th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the pretty skinny 6'0'' Cobb swings a quick righty bat that has some thump behind it already. When he starts to fill out, he can definitely end up with some legitimate power. He's a good athlete with plus run times, he has a good feel to hit, and he has the ability to play up the middle. He was a late riser before the draft and San Diego popped him pretty early despite little pre draft hype, which tells you how much they like him. He's old for the class, and the upside doesn't seem huge, but like San Diego thought, he could be a sneaky pick late in first year player drafts. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/15/63/.262/.320/.415/18

114) Andrew Salas - MIA, SS/OF, 17.1 - I can't deny that I'm starting to feel a little worn out/underwhelmed with the Salas family. I was a fan of Andrew's oldest brother, Jose Salas, and liked him as a breakout candidate, but he bottomed out hard in 2023 and 2024. His middle brother, Ethan, has been so insanely hyped for a while now, and his 2024 was underwhelming to say the least. And now here comes Andrew, who is is hit tool/plate approach first prospect with a moderate power/speed combo, which isn't my favorite profile to begin with. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with a quick and controlled swing from both sides of the dish. With those bloodlines, we know he has an advanced feel for the game too. He's a floor over upside type, but it's not like he's devoid of upside, and his floor seems higher than your typical international prospect due to those bloodlines. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/21/77/.262/.326/.423/10

115) Wilfri De La Cruz - CHC, SS/3B, 17.6 - De La Cruz certainly looks the part at a very projectable and relatively broad 6'2'' with a smooth lefty swing that is geared for both average and power. The righty swing isn't as smooth, but you can see he's trying to drive the ball with that one too, not just slap it. He's known to have a good feel to hit and a solid plate approach, but it seems likely to me that this will end up power over hit at peak. He's also a good athlete who should at the very least contribute in steals as he fills out, and maybe more than that. Feel to hit/approach, size, athleticism, projection ... that is basically what you look for in an international prospect. De La Cruz is a good one. - ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 77/23/79/.257/.338/.449/12

116) Manny Cedeno - NYY, SS, 16.8 - Cedeno is one of the youngest players in the class (you are drafting a full child here basically), but you already see the seeds of a grown man righty swing that can potentially punish baseballs. His righty swing is powerful and fast, and he makes it look easy. He also has one of the best hit tools in the class and is a good athlete. He's currently 5'11'', but I guess at his age he could easily grow more, which would make him even more dangerous. I like him. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 72/23/81/.268/.333/.451/9

117) Cristopher Polanco - TOR, SS, 17.3 - Polanco has one of, if not my favorite pure swing in the class. It is a super sweet and smooth lefty swing that is easy and under control. And when he wants to put his back into one, he can really crank it with that same smooth motion. I love it. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'11'', 180 pounds, but I think he's going to have the ability to hit the ball pretty hard at peak, and he's already known for a good hit tool. If he was a bit bigger, I would really love him, but even at his size I think he can be damn good. I'm a big fan. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/18/74/.277/.346/.429/16

118) Isiah Kiner Falefa - PIT\, 2B/3B/SS, 30.0 - Falefa seems to be penciled in as Pitt's SS at the moment, which is not optimal for them. He's a very low end option with an above average glove and below average bat. The below average bat part is what he care about the most for fantasy with a .283 xwOBA in 2024, and he's never put up higher than a .294 xwOBA in his career. He will run a bit with mid teens stolen base ability, making him relevant in medium to deeper leagues if he really can hold onto this job by Opening Day, but I have a hard time believing he is going to be a full time starter at SS all season. - 2025 Projection: 62/8/46/.262/.308/.362/14

119) Ernie Clement - TOR, 3B/SS, 29.0 - There are things to like about Clement, and he has a path to plenty of at bats, but he's really best suited for a utility role. He's already 29 years old and the upside just isn't there for fantasy even if he does have a full time job. The things to like are that he has an above average infield glove, he has elite contact rates with a 9.1% K%, he can lift and pull, and he has speed with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in a .263 BA with 12 homers and 12 steals in 452 PA. That is definitely a serviceable across the board profile if given full time at bats. But it's not the type of player, especially considering his age, where you want him to be a full time starter. He put up a .282 xwOBA, .297 wOBA, a 85.5 MPH EV and 2.4% BB%. It's a light hitting bottom of the order bat that optimally gets 400-500 PA a season, which is what he got in 2024. - 2025 Projection: 58/14/61/.265/.304/.401/13

120) Gage Workman - CHC, SS/3B, 25.5 - The Cubs took Workman 10th overall in the Rule 5 Draft, giving him a leg up on a roster spot, and with 3B currently ticketed for an unproven rookie, Matt Shaw (who I obviously absolutely love, but as we all know, nothing is guaranteed), it's conceivable that Workman ends up fantasy relevant in 2025. There is very real fantasy upside in here too at 6'4'', 202 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He also had a big time year at Double-A, slashing .280/.366/.476 with 18 homers, 30 steals, and a 27.5/11.7 K%/BB% in 126 games. He was 24 years old and the hit tool is a major issue, which is why he was available in the Rule 5, but if he can make enough hit tool gains in his mid to late 20's, which we've seen plenty of toolsy prospects do in the past, he will get interesting in a hurry. He's a lefty who was much better vs. righties than he was vs lefties, but I think that's a good thing in this case, because it means he can end up a very fun strong side of a platoon player. And his 25.2% K% vs. righties was a tad better. I kinda like him in deeper leagues as a proximity play. - 2025 Projection: 17/5/19/.218/.289/.381/5 Prime Projection: 44/11/41/.231/.309/.413/15

121) Max Acosta - MIA, SS/2B, 22.5 - Acosta was a popular international target in his incoming 2021 class (by me as well), and while he's had a solid pro career, it just goes to show you that you are really looking for those rocket ship prospects. 2025 will be going on year 5 of holding him, waiting for him to turn into a likely utility infielder by 24 years old. That's 7 years of waiting for maybe a utility player. This is almost the worst case scenario when you select hot international prospect names. You almost rather them be complete busts where you can just move on, rather than hanging around the fringes, which is where Acosta has been hanging. To be fair to him, he's coming off a damn good year in 2024 with a 119 wRC+ in 104 games at Double-A. He slashed .288/.353/.425 with 8 homers, 26 steals (in 35 attempts), and a 13.4/7.8 K%/BB%. He's not a home run hitter, but he's got some pop in his bat, and he's not a true burner, but he likes to run. The most encouraging part is obviously the contact rates. A guy who gets the bat on the ball that much and has a solid up the middle glove is a very high floor prospect. There is definitely a path for him to be a full time regular, but even in that scenario it's probably a low end one. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/8/41/.263/.318/.391/16

122)  Jared Serna - MIA, 2B/SS, 22.10 - Serna's stats dropped off when he got to the upper minors, slashing .247/.328/.356 with 2 homers, 4 steals (in 7 attempts), and a 20.7/8.1 K%/BB% in 45 games. He's a small guy at 5'7'' with high ground ball rates, so the power upside is very limited. He has speed, but he started to get caught a lot in the upper minors, and the plate skills dropped off in the upper minors too. He's likely a utility infielder, but the Marlins entire infield is far from locked down, so he's on the right team for opportunity. I still think Miami has better options than him though. - 2025 Projection: 18/2/11/.246/.299/.351/6 Prime Projection: 61/9/42/.262/.323/.388/18

123) Mikey Romero - BOS, 2B/SS, 21.3 - Here is what I wrote about Romero in the in-season Dynasty Rundowns towards the end of the season, and my thoughts remain the same: "The Red Sox 1st round pick, 24th overall, in 2022 has been almost completely ignored by everyone, including me, but Mikey is demanding our attention right now after calmly jacking out his 4th homer in 7 games since getting called up to Double-A as a 20 year old. He had 10 homers in 59 games at High-A. The reason he has been ignored is because he doesn't have big raw power, he doesn't have speed (1 steal all season), and his hit tool/plate approach isn't particularly good either with a 21.9/5.0 K%/BB% in 60 games overall. Those deficiencies still make me pretty lackluster on his future potential, but production matters, and the guy is no doubt producing while being super young for the level. Maybe he can lift and pull his way into like Connor Norby type territory." ... He closed out the season at Double-A with 6 homers and a 33.8/2.7 K%/BB% in 16 games. That K rate is scary, but he was just 20 years old getting a taste of the upper minors. It was much better at High-A with a 21% K%. He's getting no love, but the guy was picked 24th overall, he reached Double-A by 20 and showed he can do damage against upper minors pitching. I don't think he's a major dynasty asset either, but show the guy just a little bit of love, will ya. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/17/71/.245/.303/.412/3

124) William Bergolla Jr. - CHW, 2B/SS, 20.5 - I really liked Bergolla's hit/speed/bloodlines combo in his international signing year, and while the hit was most certainly there with elite contact rates, he wasn't running at all. That changed this year with him stealing 27 bags in 33 attempts at High-A. He combined that with a 10.6/8.1 K%/BB%, a .300 BA and a 114 wRC+ in 89 games as a 19 year old. He truly has special contact ability. There is absolutely zero power in here with 1 homer in his entire 168 game career, and he's a small guy without much raw power, so he isn't going to grow into much more either. It's likely a utility infielder profile, but those contact rates are elite, and if he hits his way into the lineup, he should steal enough bases with it to be interesting for fantasy. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/7/38/.283/.332/.371/23

125) Nieves Izaguirre - PHI, SS, 17.3 - Izaguirre is Acuna's cousin, so how could I leave him off this list. He's more Luisangel than Ronald though, but that ain't bad either as I like Luisangel a lot. Like Luisangel, he's not a big guy, but he has a big righty swing that looks pretty damn electric, and he combines that with a good hit tool and speed. I think he can definitely follow in Luisangel's footsteps. Don't expect Ronald's footsteps though. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 81/14/57/.266/.331/.388/28

126) Cameron Cauley - TEX, SS/2B, 22.2 - Every year that Cauley doesn't improve the hit tool makes it less likely that it's ever going to really happen. He once again put up a 29.2/8.4 K%/BB% in 93 games at High-A, which just isn't going to get the job done. But he remains on the back of this list because he's a true talent. He's lightning fast with 27 steals in 29 attempts, and he has both raw and game power with 12 homers. He also has a potentially plus up the middle glove. His glove and pure talent should eventually get him on an MLB field, but it's likely a case where the hit tool isn't good enough until his mid to late 20's, if it ever gets good enough at all. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 51/14/46/.226/.300/.415/23

127) Conrad Cason - BOS, SS/RHP, 18.8 - Selected 237th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for $1.25 million, Cason is a two way player whose future is likely on the mound. He was a multi sport star as well, so this is a guy who can do just about anything athletically at a high level, and the hope is that when he finally focuses fully on one thing, he can really thrive. That one thing seems to be pitching as his fastball already sits mid 90's and can touch upper 90's, to go along with a changeup that flashes plus and a solid slider. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with an athletic delivery, and while all areas of his game still needs refinement, he's still just 18 years old. If pitching doesn't work out, he can give hitting a go with plus speed, above average power potential, a good glove, and decent hit tool. He also needs refinement in all areas of his hitting, so that is why it seems his pitching is a bit farther ahead, and where the most upside lies. You are basically drafting the athlete here, and seeing where the chips fall, just like the Sox did. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.13/1.29/141 in 150 IP

128) Sammy Stafura - CIN, SS, 20.4 - I know that I go on and on about pro debuts, but Stafura is a good example of someone who had a terrible pro debut and then turned it around the next season. After putting up a 7 wRC+ with a 43.4% K% in 12 rookie ball games in 2023, he then hit pretty well in full season ball in 2024, slashing .270/.387/.412 with 8 homers, 31 steals, and a 24.7/15.2 K%/BB% in 92 games at Single-A. I give respect where it's due, and his value definitely rose from last year, but he's still not really all that enticing of a prospect, so I don't think the poor pro debut rankings drop led you in the wrong direction. The 85.9 MPH EV was low and the 24.7% K% was high. That's not a great combo, and he's really not all that electric of an athlete at 6'0'' with good but not great athleticism. It's just not that unique or enticing of a profile. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/16/63/.251/.325/.412/23

129) Griff O'Ferrall - BAL, SS, 22.2 - Selected 32nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Baltimore followed up their super risky pick of Honeycutt, with a super safe pick of O'Ferrall. Griff is a low upside college bat without much power, so while the real life profile of up the middle defense, contact, and some speed is enticing, it's less so for fantasy. He hit only 5 homers in 63 games in the ACC this year, and he hit only 8 homers in 186 career college games. He didn't hit a single homer in his 20 game pro debut in the lower minors. He did make a lot of contact with a 14.4% K% and he ran a bit with 2 steals in 6 attempts. The deeper the league, the more enticing he becomes, but even in deeper leagues I'm not super excited. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/9/58/.268/.324/.392/21

130) Daiber De Los Santos - MIN, SS, 18.6 - De Los Santos was a big time international prospect, signing for $1.9 million, and he went out and proved he deserved that money in his pro debut, slashing .301/.384/.460 with 5 homers, 17 steals, and a 31.0/8.9 K%/BB% in 47 games in the DSL. He's an excellent athlete at a projectable 6'1'' with a powerful and athletic righty swing to go along with plus speed. He also lifted and pulled a ton, so he should get the most of his raw power. The big red flag is obviously the 31% K%, which is way too high for the DSL especially. He's a very high risk, very high reward DSL breakout. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 70/23/76/.238/.309/.438/19

131) Jose Perdomo - ATL, SS, 18.6 - Perdomo received the highest signing bonus in the international class at $5 million, but unfortunately he was limited to just 8 games in the DSL due to a hamstring injury. He didn't do much in those 8 games with a 66 wRC+, but the 18.2/9.1 K%/BB%, 37.5% GB%, and 2 steals all look fine, so basically the sample is too small to say anything. We have to give him a mulligan and run it back in 2025. He's known for his excellent hit tool with the ultimate power/speed combo still in some question. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but it seems he's trending towards power over speed right now. There is plenty of time for him to change his body in multiple ways, so we'll see which way he decides to go. I'll split the difference for now and assume it will end up a hit tool first profile with a moderate power/speed combo, but there is still so much mystery here. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 78/18/72/.268/.327/.429/15

132) Johan De Los Santos - PIT, SS, 17.5 - De Los Santos is the brother of Yordany De Los Santos, who went through this process only a few years ago and also signed with Pitt. Yordany was one of the first misses for this SS list, but his younger brother cracks it, because the name of this game is finding the lotto ticket that pays off big, not the one you have to hold for 7 years in order to get a utility infielder out of it (not saying Yordany is doomed to that fate, it's just the long and slow development process is not what you are looking for when you draft a 17 year old). De Los Santos could easily end up in the same bucket as his older brother, but his bonus is expected to double his brother's, so maybe he has a cleaner path in pro ball too. His lefty swing definitely looks the part. It looks super natural with both feel to hit and the intent to do damage. As he adds more strength at 6'0'', 175 pounds, the hope is that the power comes. And like most of these kids, he has a good feel to hit and speed. He's pretty electric though, and that electricity does stand out a bit amongst his peers. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/17/68/.258/.319/.413/24

133) Jose Pena - BAL, SS, 16.8 - I can't find any video of Pena, probably because he has such a common name, which is a shame because it seems like he could be someone I really like. I will keep an eye out though and I'm sure I'll find a video that pops up eventually, in which time I could change his ranking here. He's one of the youngest players in the class and has one of the best frames at a projectable 6'2'', 155 pounds. He supposedly swings a quick and explosive bat (which I haven't seen) and he's fast. I know you could say that seeing a few swings isn't that big of a deal, but I don't know, I've had a ton of success picking out my favorite international prospects based on watching their swings and movements, so without seeing that, I can't really say he's a target for me yet. I'm just going to keep my eye out for that video, which I know is clearly out there somewhere. I just can't find it. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 78/18/72/.260/.320/.425/28

134) Juan Sanchez - TOR, SS, 17.7 - Sanchez is another one I can't find video on (see Jose Pena above too), again probably because his name is just too common, but I will continue to keep my eye out and I'm sure I'll find some eventually. He definitely has the build and tools you are looking for though at 6'3'', 200 pounds with power and speed. That's a big boy with athleticism. When I find the video, I will add more. Not much more I can say until then. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 71/23/79/.245/.317/.448/10

135) Josh Kasevich - TOR, SS, 24.3 - Kasevich is a hit tool/defense play, which doesn't excite me for fantasy, but he hits the ball hard enough, and runs just enough to remain kinda interesting. And unlike some other fringy prospects on the Jays, his glove might actually get him on the field. The hit tool is damn good with a 11.8% K% and .296 BA in 128 games in the upper minors. He put up an 89.6 MPH EV at Triple-A, which is pretty good, and he was 13 for 14 on the bases with solid speed. The deeper the league, the more value he will have, but if the hit tool transfers to the majors, he could end up having value in most league sizes. - 2025 Projection: 9/1/10/.259/.305/.357/2 Prime Projection: 73/9/58/.276/.323/.382/11

136) Joshua Kuroda-Grauer - OAK, SS, 22.2 - Selected 75th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Grauer has been a contact machine everywhere he's played, putting up a .428 BA with a 7% K% in 53 games in the Big Ten his Junior year, and then stepping right into pro ball and doing the same with a .324 BA and 7.1% K% in 28 games at Single-A, High-A, and Triple-A. Even the fact he made it to Triple-A shows how fast Oakland thinks he can contribute. He combines the elite contact rates with speed (5 steals in pro ball and 24 steals in college), a solid plate approach, and decent hard hit ability. He won't hit many homers with very high groundball rates (5 homers his junior year and 0 homers in pro ball), but he doesn't need to aim for homers with his profile. He's probably best suited for a utility role on a good team, but his contact/speed profile can definitely make an impact if he works his way into an everyday job. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/7/42/.268/.327/.376/19

137) Franyerber Montillo - DET, 2B/SS/3B, 19.11 - I'm not sure Montillo deserves to crack this list after how hard he struggled once he got the call to Single-A. He was already 19 years old, so seeing him put up a 42 wRC+ with a 31.6% K% in 20 games is not a good sign. He looked really good in rookie ball with a 136 wRC+ and above average across the board production, but those numbers don't look as impressive after the immediate drop off at the more age appropriate Single-A. The reason he does crack this list though is because I just like the look of him at the plate. He's a pretty electric player at 6'0'' with some power and athleticism. He can also lift and pull it, so he should be able to get the most out of his power. And he's walked a ton in his career, even at Single-A with a 15.2% BB% at that level. I'll give him a pass for the struggles in full season ball because it's not like he was ancient at a relatively recently turned 19, and regardless of age, there is an adjustment period humans often have to make to tougher levels, new teams, cities, coaches etc ... Hard to say he's too sought after of a prospect, but there is something here that I definitely like a lot when watching him. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/17/66/.250/.330/.418/18

138) Ayden Johnson - OAK, SS, 17.2 - It's always a little crazy to me watching some 14 year olds workout video and evaluating them for dynasty baseball, hah, but here we are, and Johnson put together a fire training video. He also shows a body transformation of going from a chubby kid to ripped. At one point his trainer says, "Can you believe this kid is just 14 years old?" ... hah, and I mean, you can't help but laugh and say, "no." ... but I'm just being tongue in cheek, I already talked about not going down that path of disbelieving everyone's age. It is what it is. He already speaks perfect English, which I guess is considered a good thing? Does that really matter though? I'm not so sure. Okay, on to things that really matter, which is that he has a ton of the traits you look for in a hyped international prospect. He's a rock solid 6'2'', 180 pounds with a quick and powerful righty swing that should have plenty of power potential at peak. He's also a good athlete and has a good feel to hit. And he's quite clearly a hard worker. It seems to me his future is as a power hitting bruiser if it all works out. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/24/79/.259/.324/.456/9

139) Paul DeJong - FRA, SS/3B, 31.8 - DeJong shouldn't be a starter, but I could have said that last off-season and he was a starter for a large chunk of the season, so maybe he can once again find a job this off-season. He still accrued only 482 PA by the end of the season, so 400-500 PA is probably a best case scenario. He's a lift and pull and nothing else guy, leading to 24 homers with a 32.4/4.8 K%/BB%. I shouldn't say nothing else, because he also has a very good glove, which is how he found a job last year. If he can do the same in 2024, he'll hit dingers but hurt you everywhere else. - 2025 Projection: 41/16/43/.221/.287/.412/2

140) Max Schuemann - OAK, SS/3B, 27.9 - Schuemann is a super utility player who has some fantasy friendly skills with speed (14 steals in 459 PA), lift (16.6 degree launch) and OBP (10.2% BB%), and Oakland has an open-ish job at 3B, so he can easily rack up a ton of at bats in 2025. The hit tool is the biggest issue with a 25.9% K% and .220 BA. He lifts it a lot, but he doesn't pull it enough with a 36.4% Pull%, and the 91.8 MPH FB/LD EV isn't great, so that is a recipe for a very low BA. The 89 MPH AVG EV and 5.6% Barrel% isn't bad though, so he definitely has some pop (7 homers). He's 27 years old and the K rates and hit tool were a problem even in the minors, so I don't think his supporting skills are good enough to overcome the at least below average hit tool. But if the hit tool can improve, and/or he finds his way into everyday at bats, he can definitely end up fantasy relevant. - 2025 Projection: 46/8/35/.227/.309/.366/13

141) Jadher Areinamo - MIL, 2B/SS/3B, 21.4 - Areinamo is probably a utility infielder long term with one of the wackiest swings I've ever seen. I imagine if they ever drew Micky Mouse playing baseball, they would have him swing something like Areinamo. It's amazing that he has elite contact rates with that swing, but he does with a 11.1% K% and .301 BA in 110 games at High-A. He doesn't have big raw power with only 10 homers at 5'8", and he's not a burner despite 32 steals, so I don't think his fantasy value is huge. But if the elite contact rates stick in the upper minors, he'll be interesting for deeper leagues. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/9/42/.268/.321/.387/16

142) Yairo Padilla - STL, SS, 17.9 - Padilla signed for $760,000 in last years international class, so he was certainly a legit prospect, and then he went out in the DSL and played well, slashing .287/.391/.404 with 1 homer, 22 steals, and a 17.9/10.5 K%/BB% in 35 games. He's a smooth operator in all facets of the game at an athletic and projectable 6'0''. More power should definitely be coming down the line, he has a good feel to hit, he has a really good glove at SS and he has speed. He didn't exactly blow the doors off DSL pitching, but he hit well, and he's still only 17 years old. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/17/69/.261/.320/.416/24

143) Raymer Medina - TBR, SS, 17.5 - The thing that stands out about Medina to me is that the ball jumps off his bat from a very controlled and powerful swing from both sides of the plate. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but he's got the right kind of strength/thickness, and he definitely packs a punch with that swing. I think more power is coming, which he can combine with a good feel to hit and athleticism. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/20/77.255/.316/.433/12

144) Ty Southisene - CHC, SS, 19.9 - Selected 120th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signed for $1 million, Southisene is a small guy at 5'9'', 160 pounds, and he's on the older side for the class, but Chicago didn't pay him over slot for nothing. He's the quintessential little man discount as he's raked and been a standout performer everywhere he's been. There isn't much power potential in the bat, but he has a potentially plus hit/speed combo which can certainly be impactful for fantasy. Utility infielder is probably the most likely relatively good outcome scenario, but if you love betting on the underdog who just keeps on raking while not getting enough love (although he just made one million dollars at 19 years old, so he's doing just fine ;), that's Southisene. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/9/48/.268/.323/.372/24

145) Warel Soriano - TBR, SS, 17.7 - Soriano has a vicious righty swing that is fast and made to do damage, which is what I love to see from these prospects, and he's also fast and projectable at a skinny 6'0'', 165 pounds. It's so hard to say how these kids are going to mature and end up physically, but there is definitely a path for him to develop a truly impact power/speed combo down the line. It's not like he's 6'3'', so I'm not going to say it's super high upside, but this is definitely an upside pick, and the hit tool is solid too. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 71/22/77.251/.314/.442/16

146) Trey Snyder - NYM, SS, 19.6 - Selected 144th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for $1.32 million, the first thing that jumps out about Snyder is how much bat speed he can generate from such a simple swing, and at a solid 6'2'', 195 pounds, there is power behind it too. The swing is more geared for average than power right now, but he has plus speed too, so that profile can work even if he doesn't try to lift and pull more down the line. He made his pro debut in 2024, and while he didn't perform well with a 58 wRC+ in 6 games, he was thrown right into Single-A, and the 23.1/15.4 K%/BB% was actually pretty encouraging. He has the potential to be a solid across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/16/61/.264/.329/.416/18

147) Ronny Cruz - CHC, SS, 18.8 - Selected 90th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for an under slot $620,000, Cruz is 6'1'', 170 pounds with a big righty swing that has power potential written all over it. The swing mechanics are still raw, there is hit tool risk, and he's not a burner, so I wouldn't necessarily circle him as a later round target right now, but he's young for the class, and the Cubs popped him relatively early, so they obviously like him even if part of the reason was the under slot bonus. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 71/23/78/.244/.317/.441/8

148) Juan Cabata - CHC, SS, 16.11 - Luis Pena of the Brewers is what you hope that Cabata can duplicate in 2025. He has one of the best hit tools in the class with a very smooth, easy and fast lefty swing. He's not a big guy at 5'11'', 165 pounds, so power likely isn't going to be a big part of his game, but the hope is that it can get to average. And he's got some speed and base stealing ability. He could be one of the top hit/speed combo coming out of the DSL if things go right. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/14/59/.266/.325/.412/23

149) Brayan Cortesia - WSH, SS, 17.4 - Cortesia hit a growth spurt of late, which yes, that is what boys do from the ages of 13 years old to 16 years old ha, growing to 6'1'', and those extra inches gives him that added boost of upside to combine with his good feel to hit, good glove, and plus speed. If the power really starts to come down the line, there is potential for him to be a complete prospect, and his righty swing definitely looks the part (quick, powerful, athletic, launch). - ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 79/18/69/.266/.326/.423/24

150) Ramcell Medina - KCR, SS, 17.5 - Medina has a perfect combination of refinement, history of production, and now size/projection. He's grown to 6'2'', 180 pounds, and he looks pretty damn physical in the box already. He could end up with real power to go along with an advanced feel at the plate and solid athleticism. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/22/77/.262/.334/.434/7

151) Juan Tomas - CHC, SS, 17.4 - Tomas has that prototypical build you are looking for at a projectable 6'3'', and he's a switch hitter with a quick and powerful swing from both sides of the dish. He has that Alonso Soriano type athleticism, and like Soriano, he has the potential for an impact power/speed combo if it all comes together. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/20/74/.250/.318/.436/20

152) Jacob Gonzalez - CHW, SS, 22.10 - Gonzalez cracks this list purely for pedigree (15th pick in the 2023 Draft), glove, and opportunity. Chicago actually isn't that weak in the infield anymore, but that is only theoretical as nobody is established, so Gonzalez should certainly get some opportunities to battle for playing time in the near future. When you take a guy 15th overall, you generally want to give him a look, no matter how mediocre the pro career has been, and it's been damn mediocre. He just put up a .225/.284/.321 triple slash with 5 homers, 10 steals, and a 14.0/6.9 K%/BB% in 94 games at Double-A. He gets the bat on the ball and he has a solid infield glove and that is about it. He's only relevant in probably like 30 teamers, but the opportunity I forsee him eventually getting is why he barely cracks the list. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/12/48/.252/.321/.392/10

153) Warren Calcano - KCR, SS, 17.6 - Calcano simply checks a lot of boxes as a switch hitting SS with projection (6'1'') and an ease about all aspects of his game. He looks like a natural at the dish and in the field with good athleticism. Nothing really sticks out too much in his profile, but he seems to have a high floor (relative to the international class), and there is definitely some upside in here too. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 78/15/63/.265/.335/.415/15

154) Liberts Aponte - CIN, SS, 17.5 - You are hoping for a Starlyn Caba type rise for Aponte. He has a standout glove at SS, so if the contact rates are strong and he steals some bags, the real life hype can be the driver of his value. His BP is pretty unimpressive, but he's obviously young, so if he gets stronger and bigger as he ages, combined with his other skills, there can definitely be some hype coming down the line on the back of the glove. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 73/10/51/.262/.323/.365/21
