1) Vladimir Guerrero Jr. - TOR, 1B, 25.6 - We can finally put the "Vlad has only had a great year in a minor league ballpark" narrative to rest. His 165 wRC+ this year was almost identical to the 166 mark he put up in 2021. Granted he hit 48 homers in the minor league park and only 30 this year, but still. His underlying numbers were screaming that he was legitimately elite despite the relatively mediocre surface stats in 2023, so his big year really isn't that surprising. I don't have a fancy bat speed + contact rate stat to give you, but if I did, Vlad, Yordan, and Soto would be the cream of the crop. Vlad swung a 75.9 MPH bat with a 13.8/10.3 K%/BB%. And he crushes the ball with a 93.8 MPH EV. The 7.4 degree launch is still subduing the homer power a bit, and he doesn't run much with only 2 steals, so I wouldn't quite call him a truly elite dynasty asset, but he's not far off. - 2025 Projection: 99/32/109/.308/.383/.528/4

2) Bryce Harper - PHI, 1B, 32.5 - You can find some things here and there which maybe can look like small red flags in hindsight if Harper does start to decline, like a nearly career worst in xwOBA (.361), Barrel% (10.6%), and sprint speed (27.4 ft/sec), but I think that is simply slicing and dicing the numbers too much when it comes to a proven stud like Harper. And none of those marks were too bad or too far off from career norms. His 145 wRC+ was a 3 year high and slightly better than his 142 career wRC+. He crushes the ball with a 91.1 MPH EV and he has a strong plate approach with a 21.9/12.0 K%/BB%. It doesn't seem like we can count on more than a handful of steals anymore (7 steals), but he strikes me as the type who could rake well into his late 30's. I wouldn't be thinking about selling Harper off quite yet. - 2025 Projection: 98/33/99/.287/.382/.520/10

3) Matt Olson - ATL, 1B, 31.0 - What goes up, must come down. After putting up a career year in 2023 with 54 homers, Olson nearly bottomed out with the 2nd worst year of his career in 2024 with a 117 wRC+. While I didn't see him falling that far, I saw the fall coming, writing in his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "2023 strikes me as a career year, but Olson is one of the premier power hitters in baseball." And now I can follow up that blurb with "2024 strikes me as a down year, and Olson is still one of the premier power hitters in baseball." He dominated to close out the season with 16 homers and .949 OPS in his final 63 games. He still hit the ball very hard with a 12.4% Barrel% that was right in line with career norms. It was just a down year. He remains one of the best power hitters in the game. - 2025 Projection: 93/36/115/.253/.348/.517/1

4) Pete Alonso - FRA, 1B, 30.4 - Alonso's BA unsurprisingly bounced back from a .205 BABIP induced .217 BA in 2023, rising to .240 with a .276 BABIP in 2024, which is right around his career norms. The ebbs and flows of a baseball career are always interesting, with luck being such a big part of the game. Make sure to keep that in mind when evaluating Alonso's career low 34 homers this year too. His 14.4 degree launch was 3.8 degrees lower than last year, so there might have been a conscious attempt to balance out his profile, but 34 homers is a really nice floor to have. And that is basically a reasonable floor with a 95.3 MPH FB/LD EV and a 75.3 MPH swing that is the 16th fastest swing in baseball amongst qualified hitters. Seeing how fast he swings the bat gives added confidence that his skills are not going to tank in his 30's. This is a special talent who should be ripping dingers deep into his mid 30's. - 2025 Projection: 92/37/115/.248/.339/.507/3

5) Freddie Freeman - LAD, 1B, 35.7 - The decline has to come one day, right? And as we saw with Paul Goldschmidt, when it comes for a player around this age, their dynasty value falls off a cliff very quickly. If I owned Freeman, even in win now mode, I would be mighty tempted to cash my chips in this off-season, even if the offer isn't like a godfather type offer. He had another excellent year in 2024 with a 137 wRC+, 22 homers, 9 steals, and a 15.7/12.2 K%/BB% in 147 games. His .370 xwOBA was a career low, but it was still in the top 6% of baseball, which just shows how great of a career he's having. He should have a gentle decline, but even a gentle decline will tank his trade value. It's better to sell a year early than a year late. I think this is the year to pull the trigger. - 2025 Projection: 92/25/102/.290/.384/.501/10

6) Spencer Steer - CIN, 1B/OF, 27.4 - Good luck trying to predict stolen bases. Steer was quite bad at stealing bases in the minors, and barely ran. He went 0 for 1 in his 28 game MLB debut in 2022. And then over the last two years he's become one of the better base stealers in the majors. He went 15 for 18 in 2023 and then 25 for 28 in 2024. His 28.2 ft/sec sprint speed is definitely plenty fast enough to steal bags if you are good at it, and it seems Steer has been putting in the work on that part of his game. It's a big deal for his fantasy value, because he already had a strong plate approach and above average game power. He had a 20.9%/11.0% K%/BB% with an 88 MPH EV, 17.4 degree launch, and a 44.4% Pull%. With the newfound stolen bases, that should make him a perennial .250/20+/20+ guy for the next several years. And if he can find just a hair more raw power in his late 20's, there could be a big career year or two mixed in there. Defense is his biggest problem as he isn't good anywhere on the field, but he has versatility (he can play every position but CF), and he's not terrible at any of them either. I'm not really concerned about his playing time at all. I've been high on Steer since his breakout in the upper minors in 2022, and I'll continue to be high on him. - 2025 Projection: 81/25/90/.253/.339/.456/21

7) Triston Casas - BOS, 1B, 25.3 - Casas missed 4 months of the season after suffering torn cartilage in his ribs in late April. I've had two pretty big rib injuries in my life, once playing tackle football with my knucklehead friends when we were like 18 years old (no pads, just pickup tackle), and once playing flag football in my law school league. I guess maybe the lesson is that tackle football isn't anymore dangerous than flag football ;) ... but point being, when you hurt your ribs, any movement at all can be extremely painful. It's not surprising that he was rusty when he returned in mid August, but by the end of the season, he was starting to hit his stride with 5 homers and a 1.026 OPS in is final 12 games. The rib injury was a small bump in the road, but that was all it was as he's still on the path to being one of the top slugging 1B in baseball. He swings a double plus 74.6 MPH bat, which is really all you need to know about how legit his power is. His 90.2/95.8 MPH AVG/FB EV also backs up how elite his power is, and he's never had any launch issues in his career, so there are zero worries there either. The only worry is that the hit tool ends up below average with a 32.2% whiff%, but it was better in 2023 (28.1% whiff%), and even with a below average hit tool, he will still be a beast with high OBP's (12.3% BB%). Buy any discount you can on Casas, especially in OBP and 6+ hitting cat leagues. He's going to be a monster. - 2025 Projection: 86/32/94/.253/.348/.514/1

8) Josh Naylor - CLE, 1B, 27.9 - Naylor crushed a career high by far 31 homers in 152 games, and while my first reaction is that he got lucky and this isn't sustainable, it actually might not be all that far off from his true talent level. For one, he played in a career high games by far too (122 games was his previous career high). And he hits the ball damn hard with a 94.3 MPH FB/LD EV. He's not a huge lift and pull guy, but his 11.1 degree launch with a 41.6% Pull% is fine, and he puts the ball in play a ton with a 16.6% K%. Sure 31 homers is on the high side, but it's not like it's some crazy total he couldn't possibly repeat. And on the flip side, his .243 BA was unlucky with a .246 BABIP (career .282 BABIP). He finished 30th overall on the Razzball Player Rater and is currently going 92nd overall in NFBC drafts, so that tells me that everyone is expecting regression, but I think there is a real chance he could put up a few really big seasons in these prime man muscle late 20's years. I'm not saying to target him, I'm just saying don't totally discount the possibility of him putting together some really big career seasons in these next few years. 2025 Projection: 81/27/92/.269/.335/.473/7

9) Samuel Basallo - BAL, C/1B, 20.7 - Basallo didn't quite obliterate the upper minors like he did the lower minors, slashing .278/.341/.449 with 19 homers, 10 steals, and a 21.1/8.6 K%/BB% in 127 games, but when you take into account that he was 19 years old for the vast majority of the season, it gets a lot more impressive. He was also much better at Double-A with a 134 wRC+ in 106 games than he was at Triple-A (62 wRC+ with a 31.4% K% in 21 games), so I think we can give him a pass for an adjustment period with a new team, coaches, teammates, league, home park etc ... Even at Triple-A, the sweet lefty swinging, 6'4'' Basallo put up a 91.1 MPH EV. He's always put up solid contact rates in the minors, but the spike at Triple-A could also be an indicator that we shouldn't expect the highest BA at least early in his career. He puts the ball on the ground a decent amount, but with his type of double plus power, he's launch proof. I don't know where he fits in defensively with Adley behind the plate, and plenty of competition at 1B (Mayo and Mountcastle), but long term there seems to be plenty of room for all of them. He's a special power bat. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/35/.241/.300/.430/2 Prime Projection: 84/30/97/.268/.337/.505/6

10) Vinnie Pasquantino - KCR, 1B, 27.6 - As much as I want to keep calling for the big Vinnie breakout, and as enticing the contact/EV combo is, he now has 1,112 career PA with a slightly above average 7.6% Barrel%. It's actually declined every year of his career, so you can't even say it's headed in the right direction. His home ballpark is straight up death on lefty homers with a 68 HR Statcast Value. That HR Park factor is by far the worst for both lefty and righty splits (a 72 for Giants righties is next to last). While he crushes the ball with a 91 MPH EV, his FB/LD EV's haven't been nearly as impressive with a 92 MPH FB/LD EV in 2022, a 92.1 MPH mark in 2023, and finally a 93.7 MPH mark in 2024. That 2024 mark is his best yet, and he did close out his season by hitting 8 homers in his final 27 games before going down with a thumb injury that required surgery. If not for the injury, he was on pace to hit 20+ homers. If he played in a better ballpark for lefty homers, his 12.8% K%, 14.6 degree launch, and 47.2% Pull% might be capable of putting up some truly special seasons, but in the very worst park for lefty homers by far, it seems mid 20's is a fair expectation. And hopefully that thumb surgery doesn't keep popping up in 2025. 2025 Projection: 73/24/92/.269/.333/.455/1

11) Cody Bellinger - CHC, OF/1B, 29.9 - When you have a 90.6 MPH FB/LD EV with a 17.4 degree launch, you are going to be highly dependent on how juicy the baseballs are in any given season (I talked a lot about this last year, and I think nobody really knows how each season's baseballs are going to play exactly, including MLB executives, until they roll them out and see), and with the baseballs not being as juicy in 2024 as they were in 2023, Bellinger's homer totals dropped from 26 in 130 games in 2023 to 18 in 130 games in 2024. His Barrel% and FB EV were very close to identical, so it was as perfect of an example of the balls as can be. The good news is that his much improved contact rates from 2023 transferred completely with a 15.6% K%, so that helps both his BA and homer power play up. He didn't run much last year with only 9 steals in 11 attempts, but he's still fast with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint, so that is on the low end of expectations. After such an insane start to his career, it is a bit underwhelming to see him settle in as a solid across the board contributor in his "prime" years, but that is what he is. 2025 Projection: 75/22/83/.263/.321/.444/14

12) Christian Walker - FRA, 1B, 34.0 - Christian Walker's real legacy will be to give every Quad-A, 1B masher hope that they too can become a perennial 30 homer, late career breakout bat, when the reality is that they probably won't be. But hey, you never know, it could happen (I'm looking at you, Luken Baker). As for Walker, he once again had an excellent season with a .351 xwOBA, 119 wRC+, and 26 homers in 130 games. His 75 MPH swing is straight elite, and with how much contact he generally makes, of course he's a beast. That is a special bat speed/contact combo. His strikeout rate did jump 4.9 percentage points to 24.1%, but his whiff rates were actually down a tad, so I don't see need to worry there. He's 34, and father time never loses, so every year is now a bit of a roll of the dice as to when the decline hits, but as of now, there are zero signs of decline. 2025 Projection: 80/32/94/.250/.331/.485/4

13) Jake Burger - MIA, 1B/3B, 29.0 - Burger simply crushes baseballs with a near elite 74.7 MPH swing that produces big time exit velocities (91.3/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV). He doesn't do anything else particularly well, but as long as he makes enough contact (his 25.9% K% was a career best and it's been improving every year of his career), and gets on the field (he doesn't have any concerns there in Miami), he will be a major asset in our game of fantasy. He has a career BA of .251 in 1,344 PA, and as I laid out, his power is no joke. Burger deserves to be treated as a pretty coveted fantasy asset. Don't underrate him. 2025 Projection: 73/32/89/.251/.308/.480/1

14) Bryce Eldridge - SFG, 1B, 20.5 - Let me just pump the brakes on Eldridge a little bit ... hold up ... don't kill me quite yet. I love Eldridge. He is so clearly a beastly power bat at 6'7'', 223 pounds with 23 homers in 116 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. But let me just bring up a few reasons why maybe not quite enough risk is being factored into his current humongous fantasy hype. For one, his hit tool is a legitimate risk with a 25.3% K%, and it was high in the AFL too with a 34.8% K% in 10 games. Sure he made it to the upper minors as a 19 year old, and while he didn't embarrass himself or anything, he didn't dominate either with only 1 homer in 17 games. His FB rates and launch are fine, but he's not exactly a launch machine. And lastly, San Francisco is death on lefty homers. Eldridge has the power to overcome that, so I'm not going too crazy there, but combined with the swing and miss and moderate launch, that is a trifecta of negatives which tells me to maybe have just a small amount of restraint here. Again, I love Eldridge. He's a special power bat. I just give this negatively tinted blurb relative to the monster hype he's already getting, and maybe something to at least keep in mind when you are dealing in trade talks involving him this off-season from either direction. 2025 Projection: 29/10/36/.227/.301/.423/2 Prime Projection: 88/32/97/.258/.342/.495/6

15) Salvador Perez - KCR, C/1B, 34.11 - I keep trying to predict Perez' decline, and he keeps chugging along just fine, finishing as the 3rd best catcher in fantasy in 2024. As usual, he ripped dingers with 27 homers, a 91.1 MPH EV, and 19.0 degree launch. He also managed to actually improve his plate approach with a 6 year best 19.8% K% and career best 6.7% BB%. He still chases a ton with a 42.9% Chase%, but a 73.2 MPH swing is firmly plus, so the cliff ain't here yet. Father time is obviously undefeated, so the decline will come soon, but it sure seems like he has some more good seasons in him yet. I just still feel hesitant to be the one left holding the bag when it does happen. - 2025 Projection: 59/26/83/.258/.307/.451/0

16) Michael Busch – CHC, 1B, 27.4 – Busch is a mixed bag of things you really want to buy into, and things that make you hesitant to buy in too hard. On the positive side, his 11.2% Barrel%, 89.9/95.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, and 17.2 degree launch makes you think he can truly be a preeminent power hitter in this game. But those numbers only resulted in 21 homers in 152 games last year, and his expected homer totals were right in that area too, so he wasn’t really unlucky there. His below average 70.3 MPH swing it really the thing that makes me hesitant to start projecting perennial 30+ homer seasons. The true top power hitters in the game generally swing a much, much quicker bat, and while that bat speed doesn’t preclude him from hitting 30+, I think it does make mid 20 homer projections more reasonable moving forward, which would make him a good fantasy first baseman, but not a truly great one. And of course the most obvious downside is the swing and miss with a 28.6% K%, leading to a .248 BA and .217 xBA. I’m not expecting his BA to bottom out, but I think the risk is there. Add a star in OBP leagues as his plate approach is excellent with a 11.1% BB% and well above average 23.2% Chase%. 2025 Projection: 77/25/83/.244/.330/.458/2

17) Michael Toglia - COL, 1B/OF, 26.8 - Tyler Soderstrom is my 2024 version of Mark Vientos, because Vientos "came out of nowhere" and Soderstrom fits that a bit better, but Toglia is most definitely one of my top power bat targets for 2025. He put up a 17.3% Barrel% in 116 games. I mean, I could honestly end the blurb right there. Go get this man ... but I'll continue. His 92.1/95.7 MPH AVG/FB EV is beastly, which he combines with a 15.1 degree launch. He swings a quick bat with a 73.2 MPH swing, and it's not very long either at 7.5 feet. The hit tool is definitely an issue with a 32.1% K%, 34.9% whiff%, and .218 BA, but Coors Field will give him all the help he can get there, and his .244 xBA isn't bat at all. The hit tool risk is also fully factored into his current price, and I would argue overly factored in. He also stole 10 bags in 11 attempts (in only 116 games), which is an nice little bonus to offset the low BA. And in OBP leagues he's an even bigger target with an 11.8% BB%. I'm willing to take on the batting average risk when the power upside is so high. I'm going after Toglia. 2025 Projection: 77/31/89/.232/.320/.475/9

18) Spencer Torkelson - DET, 1B, 25.7 - Torkelson swings a quick bat with a 73.6 MPH swing, he hits the ball hard with an 89 MPH EV, he lifts it with a 20.2 degree launch, he doesn't chase with a 23.2% Chase%, and he gets the bat on the ball with a very respectable 26.6% whiff%. I mean, that really should work as a legitimate impact power bat. And obviously he already does have one big power season under his belt with 31 homers in 159 games in 2023. He struggled hard in 2024 with only 10 homers and a 92 wRC+ in 92 games, getting sent down to the minors mid season, but when he returned to the bigs, he was much better with 6 homers and a 125 wRC+ in his final 38 games. The hit tool is definitely very shaky (.233 career BA), and he has one of the worst ballparks for righty homers, so there are reasons to have some restraint, but there are enough positive signs here to lead me to believe he is in for a bounce back 2025. He might not end up the bat we hoped for when he got selected 1st overall in 2020, but there should be plenty of impactful power seasons to come. 2025 Projection: 71/27/84/.233/.312/.443/2

19) Nick Kurtz - OAK, 1B, 22.1 - Selected 4th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Kurtz had one of the best pro debuts in his draft class with 4 homers in 7 games at Single-A, and a 129 wRC+ with a 20.0/13.3 K%/BB% in 5 games at Double-A. It was a just a continuation of the 3 years of dominance in the ACC. He's a large man at 6'5'', 240 pounds in the mold of a Jim Thome, country strong type. But he's not just brute strength, he has electric bat speed that led to 61 homers in 164 career games in college. He combines the at least plus power with an extremely patient plate approach and good feel to hit (16.2%/30% K%/BB%). He also has some sneaky athleticism, evidenced by a perfect 11 for 11 on the bases in his college career. The ceiling here is your classic complete hitting first baseman with power and patience. And it looks like the Athletics intend to fly him through the minors, so it might not even be crazy to see him break camp with the team, even if I wouldn't bet on that. The biggest downside is that his season ended on August 24th with a hamstring injury, and injuries have plagued him throughout his career, so I think it's something that has to be taken into account unfortunately. He returned in time to obliterate the AFL (1.058 OPS in 13 games), so there are no longer term concerns with this specific injury. - 2025 Projection: 48/16/57/.247/.323/.439/4 Prime Projection: 87/28/93/.269/.357/.490/7

20) Tyler Soderstrom - OAK, 1B, 23.4 - Soderstrom hit 2 homers in 26 games at home vs. 7 homers in 35 games on the road. Sacramento is a well below average hitter's park for Triple-A, but I would be surprised if it didn't play at least neutral, and maybe much better than that in relation to major league parks, while Oakland was one of the worst parks for homers. For a pure power hitting prospect, getting out of Oakland is a major upside boost for his value, and with how hard Soderstrom hits the ball, he's actually a major target for me this off-season. He's my Mark Vientos of 2025. The dude smokes the ball with a 91.9/97.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, resulting in a near elite 14.6% Barrel%. That is truly beastly power. Like Vientos, that is really the only attribute he brings, but near elite power conquers all, and the hit tool and plate approach were very encouraging as well, relatively. He put up a very respectable 24.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 61 games. On the downside, a 30.1% whiff% shows the hit tool isn't completely out of the woods yet, and he's also a true 0 in stolen bases. He might not end up as underrated as Vientos by the time draft season rolls around, but there is little chance his power will get the respect it deserves with the ballpark upgrade coming. Nick Kurtz is charging quickly for the 1B job, but I find it hard to believe that Oakland will be crowded enough to push Soderstrom out if he's raking (he should get some run at catcher too, possibly gaining eligibility during the season), and I'm betting on him raking. Go after him. - 2025 Projection: 69/27/81/.248/.323/.465/1

21) Paul Goldschmidt - FRA, 1B, 37.7 - When a 36 year old puts up the worst offensive season of his career by a large margin, you better believe their dynasty value is going to fall off a cliff. I agree that you don't want to underrate really, really good win now pieces just because they are in their 30's, but Goldy is a good reminder that there is a cost to that as well. When the decline comes, any hope of recouping their value for future pieces goes out the window. So if you are a Goldy owner, at this point, you might as well continue to ride this thing into the ground. And the good news is that you may just be able to squeeze another year or two of production out of him. He was definitely on the unlucky side with a .310 wOBA vs. .329 xwOBA, although that xwOBA was also a career low by far. But most importantly, he still absolutely crushed the ball with a 91.2/96.5 MPH AVG/FB EV. As long as you hit the ball that hard, you are going to produce no matter how much the plate approach diminishes. And the plate approach is where we are seeing the decline with a 26.5/7.2 K%/BB%. At 37 years old, it's possible we see another step back, but if a team is willing to give him a starting job (which I think will happen), and if the price is right, I wouldn't have a problem rostering him as a win now team. I'm just worried the name value is too high for the price to be right for me. 2025 Projection: 75/24/83/.259/.331/.440/11

22) Rhys Hoskins - MIL, 1B, 32.0 - Hoskins was definitely a diminished version of himself coming back from ACL surgery that wiped out his entire 2023 season. He had career lows in EV (88.7), xwOBA (.301), wRC+ (100), and K% (28.8%). But it's not like he was all that far off from career norms taken all together. His 12.7% Barrel% was excellent, his 26.3% whiff% was right in line with career norms (which helps alleviate some of the BA concerns from this year) and he still hit 26 homers in 131 games. With a full normal off-season to get further removed from that surgery, and at "only" 32 years old, I can see a few more prime years in the tank here. Or maybe he's getting older and more injured, and this is the new normal. That uncertainty is what is keeping his price low, and I'm inclined to take a shot on him as a win now team who wants to target a reasonably priced, proven power bat. 2025 Projection: 72/29/85/.233/.320/.452/3

23) Christian Encarnacion-Strand - CIN, 1B, 25.4 - Strand's season ended on May 7th with ligament damage in his right hand which required season ending surgery, but the good news is that he was able to get healthy enough in time for the AFL where he put up a .930 OPS in 8 games. It's a good sign that he should be healthy for 2025. My initial gut reaction is to call him a buy low as his rookie year (13 homers with a 111 wRC+ in 63 games) was much better than his 2024 even before the injury (33 wRC+ with 2 homers in 29 games), but when I dig in a little more, there are a few things that concern me. His 71.3 MPH swing isn't special, it's about average, and it comes with a poor 29.4% whiff% and horrific 40.5% Chase%. That is really not a trifecta of skills that you want to have. He doesn't provide defensive value, he's never walked much in his career, and he doesn't provide value on the bases. Seeing his 220 ADP in NFBC Drafts, I'm concerned he might be a hair overrated at the moment. He has a long history of hitting for power, Cincinnati is one of the best ballparks in the league, and the India trade seems to alleviate any playing time concerns, but I really thought I was going to like Strand a lot more before digging into him for this blurb. I think I'm kinda lukewarm on him right now. 2025 Projection: 68/26/79/.245/.304/.449/2

24) Heston Kjerstad - BAL, 1B/OF, 26.1 - Baltimore didn't seem very interested in giving Kjerstad a real shot in 2024, but they were a very deep team who had World Series aspirations, so I understand not feeling pressure to truly break Kjerstad into the majors last year. But with Santander a free agent, and Baltimore generally not known as being big spenders (and if they do spend, they should almost certainly spend in their rotation), Kjerstad looks to be the favorite for the starting RF job on Opening Day. And he deserves it with an excellent season at both Triple-A and the majors. He smoked Triple-A with 16 homers, a 26.0/12.4 K%/BB%, and a 152 wRC+ in 56 games. It came with a 90.7 MPH EV and 16.8 degree launch. And then he was really good in the majors with 4 homers, a 116 wRC+ and 90.2 MPH EV in 114 PA. The swing and miss was on the high side with a 31.3% whiff% and 28.9% K%, but neither of those are too bad, and he also chased a lot with a 35% Chase%, so he needs to refine the plate skills, but that is to be expected with such little MLB experience. He's not a great defensive player, so he's definitely going to have to rake to hold down a job, but if he doesn't rake, it doesn't matter for us anyway. He's setting up to be a really good target this off-season with relatively subdued hype, because I love betting on the pedigree (2nd overall pick in the draft), history of production, opportunity, and hard hit ability. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/81/.250/.328/.444/3

25) Jac Caglionone - KCR, 1B, 22.2 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Caglionone's pro debut was on the disappointing side, and with how tightly packed the talent is in the FYPD Top 10, he's sliding down my rankings towards the bottom of that Top 10 area. He had hit tool and chase questions coming out of the draft, and hitting .241 with a 20.6/5.6 K%/BB% in his 29 game pro debut at High-A did nothing to quell those issues. He put up a lowly 94 wRC+ with 2 homers, which isn't what you want to see from an elite college bat in the lower minors. He then went to the AFL where the pitching was so bad this year, they are actively trying to figure out how to improve the pitchers in that league in future years, and he still couldn't dominate with a .749 OPS in 21 games. Tons of hitters were putting up just wacky numbers in that extreme offensive environment. He did jack 5 homers, and there is zero doubt about his massive power, so there is no doubt he has a carrying tool even if the hit tool and plate approach take time to adjust to pro pitching. He's built like an NFL tight end at 6'5'', 250 pounds, and he obliterated the SEC with 75 homers in 165 career games. It took him some time to improve his plate skills in college as well, making big improvements his junior year with a 8.2/18.4 K%/BB% (18.2/5.3 K%/BB% his sophomore year), so the hope is that he can do the same in the majors. KC's ballpark is death to lefty homers, and while I am factoring that in a bit, he has the type of power to not get too hung up on it. Even though the pro debut does have him sliding down the rankings a bit, it's almost more because of how much comparable college talent there is at the top of this class to begin with. He's still a very exciting power bat. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/32/96/.251/.332/.503/6

26) Kyle Manzardo - CLE, 1B, 24.8 - Manzardo struggled in his first taste of the bigs, putting up a .571 OPS in his first 30 games and then got sent back down. But he was a new man when he got called up again in September, smashing 5 homers with a .873 OPS in 23 games. He carried that over into the playoffs with a 138 wRC+ in 9 games. Manzardo has average to above average raw power with a good feel to hit, strong plate approach and a lift and pull profile. He didn't really standout in any one area against major league pitching (except the lift part with a 22.1 degree launch), but he wasn't bad in any area either with a 89.2 MPH EV, 27.6% whiff% and 27.7% Chase%. Considering this was his first go around, those numbers should only improve. He isn't going to wow you with bat speed or hard hit ability, but he hits the ball often enough, and with enough power, and at the right angles to put up some very impactful fantasy seasons. He's not good on defense and he struggled vs. lefties in the majors (.566 OPS), so a strong side of a platoon role is unfortunately still on the table as a possible outcome, but I don't think he's doomed to a part time role forever as he hit lefties better in the minors. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/79/.248/.321/.447/2

27) Xavier Isaac - TBR, 1B, 21.4 - Isaac was always a power over hit prospect, but his hit tool risk shot into the stratosphere this year. He put up a 30.1% K% in 71 games at High-A, and then it got even worse at Double-A with a 40.6% in 31 games. It didn't look any better in the AFL with a 40.3% K% in 15 games. He clearly has a major problem. He wasn't nearly this bad in 2023 with a 21.3% K%, so while this didn't come completely out of nowhere, it's definitely much worse than expected. He crushes the ball with 18 homers in 102 games, he's a good athlete with 15 steals in 18 attempts, he gets on base with a 13.3% BB%, and he's very young, so he's still a very exciting prospect, but it prevents him from jumping into that elite or near elite tier coming into 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/28/91/.244/.327/.478/10

28) Luis Arraez - SDP, 1B/2B, 28.0 - If you've read me for any length of time, you know that Arraez just isn't the type of fantasy player I go after. He's a special contact hitter with an absurd 4.3% K%, which was a career best this year, and he has a career .323 BA, but the power/speed combo is just super lackluster. 4 homers with 9 steals in 150 games just isn't worth the BA bump, and neither are the 129 combined Runs and RBI. He always gets valued considerably higher than I would be willing to take him, so I never end up with him on my teams. 2025 Projection: 84/8/51/.318/.357/.420/8

29) Ralphy Velazquez - CLE, 1B, 19.10 - Velazquez was one of my top FYPD targets last off-season, ranking him 21st overall, and he more than delivered with a big season at Single-A. He cracked 10 homers with a 20.1/15.0 K%/BB% and 131 wRC+ in 82 games. He struggled when he got to High-A with a 54 wRC+ in 19 games, but considering he started the year as an 18 year old, that isn't a big deal. Cleveland moved him off catcher to 1B, which isn't surprising and is a good thing for fantasy. One of the reasons I loved him so much last off-season was because when a smart team takes a 1B prospect so high (23rd overall), you know they absolutely love the bat, and at 6'3'', 215 pounds with a smooth and powerful lefty swing, it's hard not to love his bat. He profiles as a classic middle of the order slugger. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/30/92/.258/.345/.500/6

30) Josue Briceno - DET, C/1B, 20.6 - As the world's foremost expert on Josue's, I presented you with the first zero hype Josue to pick up as quick as possible in 2022 (Josue De Paula), and then knowing a good Josue when I see one, I did the same for the 2nd zero hype Josue in 2023 (Josue Briceno). Both of their hypes have grown considerably since then, and if not for a knee sprain knocking out 2 and a half months of Briceno's season, his hype could have been even more. But he's making up for lost time right now in the AFL, winning the MVP award with 10 homers and a 1.376 OPS in 25 games. Even with the knee injury and not really having a good regular season, he still ended up with a 123 wRC+, 89.8 MPH EV and 14.8/12.5 K%/BB% in 40 games at Single-A. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with a potentially special hit/power combo. He's likely a 1B long term, which is perfect for his type of bat. Even with his profile rising, it's still not enough. He remains a major target for me this off-season. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.275/.350/.488/3

31) Ryan Mountcastle - BAL, 1B, 28.1 - Baltimore moving the LF fences back in somewhat will be a major benefit to Mountcastle after his homer totals tanked to 13 in 124 games in 2024, but he still doesn't really have the profile to fully take advantage of it with a 10.4 degree launch and 27.9% Pull%. Those numbers were much better earlier in his career before they moved the fences back, so maybe he goes back to lifting and pulling more. He definitely has the hard hit ability to take advantage if he does with a 45.2% Hard Hit% and 90.8 MPH EV. It's not just the fences though, he also has major competition for his job, so the leash is going to be very short, and his lack of defensive value and low OBP isn't going to help there. I was 100% out on Mountcastle before the fence news, and while I'm still not going after him, he's at least a bit more interesting now. 2025 Projection: 66/22/78/.268/.318/.446/3

32) Pavin Smith - ARI, 1B/OF, 29.2 - Christian Walker is a free agent, so the 1B job in Arizona currently belongs to Pavin Smith, and with the year Smith just had in 2024, Arizona may very well be happy to let him have the job. He was a straight beast in 60 MLB games with a 142 wRC+, 14.7% Barrel%, 13.1 degree launch, 90.2/96.2 MPH AVG/FB EV, and a 19.6/11.4 K%/BB%. It resulted in an elite .395 xwOBA. He can also play the OF, so even if Arizona brings Walker back, there are other avenues for him to get in the lineup. He always had an excellent plate approach, but we were waiting on the game power to tick up, and boy did it tick up this year. He looks like a great candidate for a late career breakout, and is a no doubt target. 2025 Projection: 76/24/82/.268/.342/.457/2

33) Deyvison De Los Santos - MIA, 1B/3B, 21.9 - De Los Santos is a one tool player, but that tool is so massive and so important, that it just might overcome that he does nothing else well on a baseball field. And that thing is of course double plus power. He's a power hitting bull at 6'1'' with 40 homers and a 90.6 MPH EV in 137 games in the upper minors. He swings and misses a lot (24.6% K%), he doesn't walk (5.8% BB%), he hits the ball on the ground way too much (50%+ groundball rates), he's bad on defense, and he doesn't steal bases. There is actually one other thing going for him, which is that he's been very young for the upper minors in 2023-24, and he'll still be just 21 years old for almost half of the 2025 season. There is time for him to improve his plate skills and launch. If he can, he has the upside to be one of the best power hitters in baseball, but even if he can't, there is a role for a guy who can hit 30+ homers even if that is all he does well. Miami should also have plenty of opportunity for him if he's raking. - 2025 Projection: 27/10/35/.228/.280/.426/0 Prime Projection: 73/31/88/.256/.314/.495/2

34) Nolan Schanuel - LAA, 1B, 23.2 - I wasn't high on Schanuel this off-season because as you guys already know, hit tool/plate approach first guys without a big power/speed combo is just not my bag, and what Schanuel did in 2024 is why they aren't my bag. He hit 13 homers with 10 steals, 62 Runs, and 54 RBI in a full 607 PA. Even his .250 BA wasn't good, because often "hit tool" guys don't actually hit the ball hard enough to have a truly great hit tool. You need power for that too. His 86.1/89.2 MPH AVG/FB EV is super low, he's slow as dirt with a bottom 24% sprint speed, and his 65.2 MPH swing was 5th worst amongst qualified batters. He's also not really a lift and pull guy with a 46.1% GB% and 40.4% Pull%. Now having said all that, this was his first full year of pro ball and he put up an above average 104 wRC+. That is pretty impressive. He's 6'4'', 220 pounds, so there is no way that there isn't more power in here if he ever decides to actually swing harder, which may or may not impact his elite contact rates (14.4% whiff%). He can certainly be a useful fantasy bat at peak, and there is some semblance of power upside purely because of his size, but you can't own everyone, and Schanuel is just not the type I ever own. - 2025 Projection: 79/15/68/.270/.356/.402/9

35) Andrew Vaughn - CHW, 1B, 27.0 - I guess it's definitely time to give up hope on the breakout. Vaughn now has 2,258 career PA of being a very average hitter. But damn if there still aren't a few things here that I don't want to completely give up on. He raised his launch 4.4 degrees to a career high 16.6 degrees. He put up a career best 9.3% Barrel%, which is pretty damn good. He hits the ball hard with a 90.3 MPH EV. And he gets the bat on the ball with a 22% whiff%. That should result in more than 19 homers in 149 games, but then you see the below average 70.8 MPH swing, and you go "aha," now it makes sense. The new bat speed data has been providing that missing piece to so many players for me this off-season, and that explains Vaughn right there. He's coming into his age 27 year old season, and as I laid out, there are still some things to like, so I'm not going to tank his value, but I'm finding it hard to think a breakout is coming. 2025 Projection: 68/22/79/.250/.310/.431/1

36) Zach Dezenzo - HOU, 1B, 24.11 - Houston is planning on using Dezenzo at 1B and LF in 2025, which works just fine because Houston has opportunity at both positions currently (pending any free agent/trade acquisitions). He also has an offensive profile that I am super excited about. He's going to have to earn it every step of the way, so he's not the type of target I am going to stick my neck out for, but he is 100% a "let him come to you" target for me. He's 6'5'', 220 pounds with an elite 75.4 MPH swing and a well above average 28.3 ft/sec sprint. We are talking about an absolutely elite, electric athlete here. He wasn't great in his MLB debut with a 33.8/4.6 K%/BB% and 84 wRC+ in 19 games, so the hit tool is definitely a risk, but his 31.7% whiff% wasn't too bad, and he dominated Triple-A with a 149 wRC+ and 22.1/13.3/ K%/BB% in 25 games. I'm willing to take on that extra risk for the type of athlete he is. Don't reach, but definitely put a big star next to Dezenzo's name and hope he falls right into your lap. 2025 Projection: 62/15/69/.248/.312/.422/9 Prime Projection: 83/20/79/.262/.337/.444/15

37) Ben Rice - NYY, 1B, 26.6 - I'm a simple man. I see a .340 xwOBA vs. a .269 wOBA in 50 games and I'm going to buy that 9 out of 10 times. And it's not just xwOBA. The individual components back it up too. He put up a 15.6% Barrel% with a 90 MPH EV, 17.7 degree launch, 25.8% whiff%, and 20.6% Chase% in his rookie year. Sure he was already 25 years old, but it was still his first taste of the bigs, and those are super impressive marks despite the poor surface stats (.613 OPS). He also utterly decimated the upper minors with a 155 wRC+ in 49 games at Double-A and a 174 wRC+ in 30 games at Triple-A. His lefty bat is made for Yankee Stadium with a lift, pull, and crush the ball profile. He doesn't have defensive value and he hits righties better than lefties, but his bat is too good to not give a real shot to in 2025. The Yanks 1B job is currently open, but that could very easily change in the near future. I'm hesitant to go too hard after him if he isn't going to have a job, but if the Yanks make it through the off-season without a 1B, or with only a veteran stopgap, I'm going to love Rice. He's another let him come to you target. 2025 Projection: 63/19/66/.241/.328/.433/4 Prime Projection: 82/25/82/.259/.342/.457/6

38) Ryan Clifford - NYM, 1B/OF, 21.8 - After hitting only 1 homer in 31 games in New York's tough High-A ballpark (although he didn't hit any homers on the road either), Clifford got the call to Double-A as a still 20 year old and lived up to his big power profile. He jacked out 18 homers with a 133 wRC+ and 28.9/15.6 K%/BB% in 98 games. Even at High-A he put up a 124 wRC+, which is the sign of a good player who can still produce when the homers aren't coming (or it's a sign that High-A pitchers just didn't want to pitch to him with a 23.5% BB%). Clifford was one of my favorite targets in his first year player draft class because he looked like a sure bet to become an exciting power hitting prospect, and that is exactly what he's become. The strikeouts are too high to really put him into that elite tier, but I wouldn't rule out him improving there at a still young 21 years old. Even if he can't, the power will play on any level. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/31/90/.239/.324/.491/4

39) Yandy Diaz - TBR, 1B, 33.8 - Yandy was unsurprisingly unable to keep up his career high 22 homers in 2023 with it dropping back down to 14 homers in 145 games in 2024. When you have a 5 degree launch, literally everything has to go perfectly, and all the stars have to align to put up impactful homer seasons. He crushes the ball with a 92.2 MPH EV, he makes tons of contact with a 15.3% K%, and he gets on base with a career 11.3% BB%, but he has a bottom 10% of the league sprint speed, so he really can't even take full advantage of those skills. And now he's officially in his old man years at 33/34 in 2025. The upside isn't really that high to begin with, BA first plays are not my thing, he's not good on defense, he provides 0 steals, and I really don't want to be the one left holding the bag here. Diaz isn't someone I'm going to own anywhere, but he can definitely still be solid for a win now team. 2025 Projection: 80/15/75/.284/.361/.438/1

40) Nathaniel Lowe - TEX, 1B, 29.9 - No surprises here. Lowe had his usual wet napkin fantasy season. He hit only 16 homers with 2 steals in 140 games. He had a 121 wRC+ on the back of a 12.6% BB%, but even in OBP leagues, a combined 131 Runs and RBI is lackluster. He's just not a very impactful fantasy player. In 5x5 BA leagues, he's super lackluster, and in OBP and 6+ hitting category leagues he's mediocre at best. Very deep leagues are where he would hold his most value, but even there it's not like he's a league winner. He's a placeholder until you can find a better option. 2025 Projection: 76/18/76/.265/.360/.425/2

41) Jeimer Candelario - CIN, 3B/1B, 31.4 - Candelario got a monster ballpark upgrade in Cincinnati, and he did in fact hit a career high homers (on a per game basis) with 20 homers in 112 games. He's never been a huge EV guy, so he definitely needed the ballpark boost to continue to be a 20+ guy. The bad news is that the BA and OBP tanked to .225 and .279. A career worst 29.1% whiff% and 34.6% Chase% backs that up. The bottom line is that he is just an average hitter no matter how you slice it. He has a career 100 wRC+ in 858 career games. The India trades seems to lock him into a full time job, and as usual, he has the chance to be a solid but not really an impact fantasy bat. 2025 Projection: 70/22/79/.237/.308/.431/6

42) Tyler Locklear - SEA, 1B, 23.8 - Locklear's hit tool fell off a cliff in his MLB debut with a .156 BA, 40.8% K%, and 37% whiff% in 49 PA. It's a small sample, and you have to give him time to adjust to the highest level, but it's really not what you want to see. He's not the type of prospect that is just going to be handed a job, so he's going to have to start hitting pretty quickly if he wants to lock in a full time role anytime soon. He's also in a terrible hitter's park, which will subdue his offensive stats to begin with. He has plus power with 16 homers in 111 games in the upper minors, and he even had an above average 8% Barrel% in the majors, so he can certainly make an impact, but the power isn't really off the charts. Combined with the ballpark and hit tool issues, the reasonable ceiling here is likely more of a solid fantasy bat than a great one, and that is assuming he can win a job eventually. Seattle currently has opportunity at both 1B and DH, so he could earn that opportunity in 2025. 2025 Projection: 35/11/42/.230/.302/.402/2 Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.251/.332/.448/5

43) CJ Kayfus - CLE, 1B, 23.5 - I just realized that I have the same birthday as CJ Kayfus! Let's go Scorpios! That has to be worth at least a few spots in the rankings ;) But you don't need to have the same birthday to appreciate the season Kayfus just had. He obliterated High-A (188 wRC+ in 40 games), and then he proved the skills will transfer to Double-A with 10 homers, a 139 wRC+ and 28.2/12.1 K%/BB% in 67 games. He has one of the sweetest lefty swings out there which helps his solid but not great raw power play up at 6'0'', 192 pounds. He's not an extreme lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull it. The strikeout rate jumping so high at Double-A is a little concerning, because he doesn't have big defensive value, and like I mentioned, the raw power isn't off the charts. He's a good 1B and he can play some corner outfield, so there is at lest some defensive value there. He has the type of bat you want to bet on, but Cleveland has a ton of competition for at bats at his positions, and his profile isn't bulletproof enough to completely overlook that. He's a fringy Top 100 prospect for me. - 2025 Projection: 16/5/19/.239/.308/.407/1 Prime Projection: 75/23/79/.252/.331/.447/6

44) Tre’ Morgan - TBR, 1B/OF, 22.9 - The only stop of Morgan's career where he had less than a .316 BA was when he got to Double-A in late August. He put up a .211 BA in 21 games. His K% also jumped up to 18.7% from 7.8% at High-A. There isn't high upside here with a moderate power/speed combo at best, so seeing him immediately struggle harder than he ever has the first time he faced advanced competition isn't great. Don't get me wrong, I still think he can be a solid MLB bat, but if the hit tool is only good and not great, I just don't see how he can be a true impact fantasy player. He also struggled hard vs lefties (.521 OPS), so especially with Tampa, it looks likely he will be in a platoon role. This blurb ended up being much more negative than even I expected, because at the end of the day, I do believe this guy is going to hit at any level. I'm just worried about the upside. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/14/66/.280/.336/.422/13

45) Jake Cronenworth - SDP, 2B/1B, 31.2 - Cronenworth bounced back from a down 2023, but it's still not a fantasy friendly profile at all. He hit .241 with 17 homers and 5 steals in 155 games. He has plus plate skills and he can lift it, but he doesn't hit it hard enough in the air to fully take advantage of it. It's average to below average across the board, which is fine, but nothing to be excited about. 2025 Projection: 74/16/74/.238/.320/.394/6

46) Luke Raley - SEA, 1B/OF, 30.6 - Raley is a strong side of a platoon bat who just put up his 2nd straight season of a 119 wRC+. He has a very fantasy friendly power/speed combo with a 90.1/95.1 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.5 degree launch, and 28.9 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in 22 homers and 11 steals in 455 PA. The problem is that the plate approach is awful (29.7/5.9 K%/BB%), the 116 combined Runs and RBI is lacking, and he just doesn't get enough playing time to be a coveted fantasy player. In weekly lineup leagues, he's tough to use ever. In daily lineup leagues at least you can play the matchups, and he could be more than useful there. 2025 Projection: 58/20/61/.240/.315/.448/12

47) Jonathan Aranda - TBR, 1B, 26.10 - Aranda looks to be headed to a strong side of a platoon role at best, which makes it hard for him to be very enticing for fantasy, but his bat definitely started to get mighty comfortable in the majors last year. He put up a .362 xwOBA with a 16.5% Barrel% and 91.9/98.1 MPH AVG/FB EV in 44 games. It only resulted in 6 homers because he hits the ball on the ground too much with a 50.5% GB%, and he has zero speed with a bottom 14% of the league sprint speed. The plate approach is also only average with a 22.4/8.4 K%/BB%. When you hit the ball that hard, you're interesting, but there are enough other deficiencies here that make me hesitant to buy in too hard. 2025 Projection: 56/15/59/.252/.329/.430/0

48) Ryan O’Hearn - BAL, 1B/OF, 31.8 - O'Hearn is a strong side of a platoon bat who doesn't hit quite enough homers, or hit for quite a high enough average to overcome the cap on plate attempts. He hit .264 with 15 homers in 494 PA. He's a really good hitter with a .351 xwOBA, and the plate skills took a big step forward in 2024 with a career best 14.0/9.3 K%/BB%, so there is certainly value here in daily leagues, but you also have to take into account the massive playing time pressure with Mayo, Basallo, and Kjerstad all ready to break in. He's a nice fantasy bench bat in medium to deeper leagues. 2025 Projection: 52/15/56/.270/.327/.439/3

49) Tyler Black - MIL, 1B, 24.8 - Black didn't play a single game at 2B this year, telling me they have given up on playing him at that position, and he only played 9 games at 3B and 12 games in the OF. He spent the majority of his time at 1B and DH. And the bottom line is that low EV 1B/DH don't really exist, especially ones who have a good but not great hit tool. He put up an 83 MPH EV with 0 barrels, a .561 OPS and a 29.8% K% in his 57 PA MLB debut. The EV sat at 85.7 MPH at Triple-A. He also doesn't have the type of extreme lift and pull profile to really pull that off, but it doesn't go in the extreme the other way either, so he can definitely pop some dingers. If he had a viable position, I wouldn't mind the speed, OBP, good BA, some pop profile at all, but he doesn't have a position, and I don't think the upside is high enough to really wait to find out if he can find one. - 2025 Projection: 33/5/24/.245/.306/.383/9 Prime Projection: 77/13/61/.263/.332/.415/24

50) Andres Chaparro - WAS, 1B, 25.11 - I fear that Chaparro ends up a good but not great short side of a platoon 1B/DH considering the .551 OPS in 87 PA vs righties in his MLB debut, but Washington doesn't have a deep system, and they also have opportunity at 1B/DH depending on what they do this off-season. Chaparro also has a good enough contact/power profile to make a fantasy impact if he does get the playing time. He hit 23 homers with a 17.9% K% in 105 games at Triple-A, and then he held his own in the majors with 4 homers and a 18.2% K% in 132 PA. He doesn't crush the ball, but he hits it hard enough, and he has a lift and pull profile to get the most out of his power. It's most likely a bench bat long term, but if he makes it through the off-season with a job, he's not the worst guy to have on your team. - 2025 Projection: 41/13/50/.241/.316/.430/2

51) Luken Baker - STL, 1B, 28.1 - With the news of Contreras moving to 1B, that takes a lot of the wind out of Baker's sails in terms of playing time projections. It doesn't seem like St. Louis is interested in him as anything more than a power bench bat. Which is understandable considering his age and hit tool risk, but it's still unfortunate as far as fantasy goes, because the guy is a home run machine. He hit 33 homers in 84 games at Triple-A in 2023 and then hit another 32 homers in 108 games this year. He smashes the ball with a 91.1 MPH EV and he lifts it with a 17.5 degree launch. He hasn't exactly kicked the door down when he's gotten his small shots in the majors, which is what a bat like this has to do, but the power has most certainly transferred with a 92.3 MPH EV and 16.6 degree launch in 148 career MLB PA. It's come with a .198 BA though, and even though his 22.4% K% this year looks good, the 33% whiff% doesn't look good. He not only hits for power, he walks a ton too with a 14.3% BB% in the majors, so I thought he was worthy of getting a shot at an everyday job, but it's not to be. He'll have to Kool Aid Man the door down, and at 6'4'', 285 pounds, he just might. 2025 Projection: 31/11/36/.228/.321/.427/0 Prime Projection: 63/20/68/.236/.331/.462/1

52) Spencer Horwitz - TOR, 1B/2B, 27.5 - It seemed like Toronto gave up on the idea of using Horwitz at 2B in the 2nd half of last season, which makes his hold on playing time very, very tenuous. That lack of defensive value was a big reason why I was never high on him. The other reason why I was never high on him was his lack of power, and while he still doesn't have a ton of power, he outdid my expectations in that department. He proved his bat will play in his rookie year, slashing .265/.357/.433 with 12 homers, 0 steals, and a 18.4/11.0 K%/BB% in 97 MLB games. The 8% Barrel% was above average, and the 88.2 MPH EV was solid. The problem is still that he's a 1B/DH with moderate power at best and a good but not great hit tool. The bat speed is well below average and the sprint speed is in the bottom 7% of the league. He's also already 27 years old. I still see a bench bat here, and even if he does get full time playing time, the upside isn't very high. 2025 Projection: 58/13/52/.260/.338/.417/2

53) Jose Miranda - MIN, 3B, 26.9 - 1B is so light this year, and with Miranda seemingly ticketed for a large share of Minnesota's 1B job, I'll make an exception to the 20 GP qualification I'm using and include him. He has an average-ish hit/power combo with a 15.4% K%, 88.9 MPH EV, and 15.5 degree launch. It only resulted in 9 homers and a 5.9% Barrel% in 121 games, so that is very lackluster power output for a 1B, especially one who doesn't walk (4.2% BB%). He put up a 115 wRC+, but the .306 xwOBA shows there was good luck in play there. He's not an MLB starter long term, and even short term I'm sure Minnesota is hoping someone can take this job from him. 2025 Projection: 40/11/48/.262/.312/.418/2

54) Jonathon Long – CHI, 1B, 23.2 – I’m a hawk for great pro debuts coming right out of the draft, and Long’s great pro debut in 2023 certainly got my attention. Despite getting picked 266th overall as a college bat (he signed for slot value, so there were no complicating signing bonus factors), I messed around and placed Long on my Top 1,000 Rankings, writing in part, “Long makes for an interesting late round target in deeper leagues … He has a very quick and powerful swing that looks relatively legit to me, and he hits the ball hard. Obviously don’t expect a league winner, but I think he’s a real prospect.” He then went out and proved in 2024 that he is most certainly a legit prospect, to say the least. He slashed .340/.455/.528 with 7 homers and a 16.5/17.5 K%/BB% in 46 games after getting the call to Double-A. He then went to the AFL and obliterated the league with a 1.088 OPS and 6 homers in 18 games. He’s still a mostly 1B prospect (he can play some 3B too) whose reasonable projection is more of a good bat than a great one, so he’s still more of a deeper league guy, but he most certainly backed up that great pro debut. He’s a close to the majors bat who can make a fantasy impact if he can work his way into the lineup. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/20/76/.257/.326/.441/1

55) Pablo Guerrero - TEX, 1B, 18.8 - Pablo Guerrero is Vlad Guerrero's son and Vlad Guerrero's brother. He has the power of a Guerrero with 7 homers and a 119 wRC+ in 51 games in rookie ball, but he doesn't have the contact rates of a Vlad with a 30.0%/8.0% K%/BB%. He closed out the season at Single-A as a barely 18 year old and struggled with a 64 wRC+ and 1 homer in 27 games, but considering his age, I wouldn't put too much stock into that. It's super fun to bet on a Guerrero, and at 6'2'', 200 pounds with the patented Guerrero family swing, he most certainly has a carrying tool in his power. Even with the shaky hit tool, I'm apt to go after him. I think he's a bit underrated, which is hard to believe considering the bloodlines. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 72/28/85/.247/.322/.473/2

56) Blake Burke - MIL, 1B, 21.10 - Burke was selected 34th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, which is relatively high for a DH/1B bat to get drafted, which means Milwaukee really believes in Burke's bat. And why not, as Burke is a 6'3'', 240 pound masher who hit 50 homers in 182 career games in the SEC (20 homers in 72 games this season). He's had hit tool and chase issues throughout his career, but a 14.9/10.8 K%/BB% this year shows he's capable of improvement. He played in only 5 games at High-A in his pro debut for reasons I am unsure of. He didn't hit a homer, but a 22.2/11.1 K%/BB% is a good sign that the hit tool won't blow up in a bad way in pro ball, and we know the power is in there. He's not a good defensive 1B, so there is a ton of pressure on his bat to become more than a part time power hitter, but for fantasy especially, why not take the shot here. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/23/79/.250/.322/456/2

57) Josh Bell - FRA, 1B, 32.8 - Bell put up a negative 0.1 WAR in 2024 and a 0.4 WAR in 2023. He's put up about average wRC+'s over the last two years. His .310 xwOBA was a career low by far. He should be a veteran bench bat at this point in his career, but it's definitely possible he ends up finding an everyday job. He still hits the ball relatively hard, he has above average contact rates, and he was much better in the 2nd half of 2024 with a .885 OPS post break. The deeper the league, the more value he has, but there isn't a guarantee he will find a team to hand him a full time job. His value will rise or fall depending on where he lands. 2025 Projection: 60/18/73/.254/.331/.420/0

58) David Fry - CLE, C/1B/OF, 29.4 - Fry underwent surgery to repair a ligament in his elbow in early November with a 6-8 month timeline. That puts May as his earliest possible return date, and it could go into the 2nd half. That doesn't give him much of a shot to lock in a starting job, or at least a near everyday utility job. He's not a good defensive player, so he was always going to have to prove it every step of the way, and this surgery just seems like a terrible roadblock considering he's already 29 years old. The swing speed is below average, and the 90.3 MPH FB EV is also lackluster. He has 505 career MLB PA with a 124 wRC+, but some of that was luck with a career .341 wOBA vs. a .326 xwOBA. I was already torn on if he could truly be a full time player, and with the injury, it has me leaning towards mostly needing to see him healthy and raking again before truly placing a high value on him. - 2025 Projection: 34/8/38/.252/.330/.426/2

59) Billy Cook - PIT, 1B, 26.3 - Cook is a 26 year old who just put up a 38.8/0.0 K%/BB% in his 49 PA MLB debut, and his strikeout rates have been anywhere from the mid 20's to upper 30's in the minors, so the hit tool probably isn't good enough to be an MLB starter, but he's quietly kinda interesting. He put up a 92.6/97.1 MPH AVG/FB EV in the majors, and he's a launch machine with a 28.6 degree launch. Neither of those numbers were quite as extreme in Triple-A, but this guy is going to hit homers, and he hit 3 in his 16 game MLB debut (17 homers in 115 games in the minors). He's also really fast with a 29.3 ft/sec sprint, and he's a good base stealer with 26 steals in 32 attempts. The final cherry on top is that Roster Resource currently has him penciled in as Pitt's 1B, and while I doubt he makes it all off-season holding that spot, Pitt traded for Cook at the deadline from Baltimore, so they obviously like him. In deeper leagues, he's a really fun proximity play, and even in shallower leagues he's worth a looksie if you see him getting full time at bats at some point in 2025. 2025 Projection: 41/11/45/.225/.298/.416/7

60) Creed Willems - BAL, C/1B, 21.10 - Willems isn't a good defensive player, he chases a lot, and there is hit tool risk, so playing time is always going to be an issue, but if he does get his bat in the lineup, he's going to hit dingers. He has plus raw power and he gets to all of it with very high flyball rates, jacking out 13 homers in 82 games at High-A and 4 homers in 16 games at Double-A. It's a good sign that his K% didn't explode at Double-A with a 18.8% K% (20.9/10.7 K%/BB% at High-A), although it came with a 2.9% BB%. He's almost certainly going to need a trade to find a full time job, so he should be solid trade bait at the deadline. And if he ends up on a team who needs a power bat, Willems could fill that role. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/22/75/.238/.312/.441/2

61) Rafael Flores - NYY, C/1B, 24.5 - Flores' power took a big step forward in 2024, and it resulted in him destroying Double-A, slashing .274/.359/.519 with 15 homers, 6 steals, and a 26.7/10.3 K%/BB% in 65 games. He also so easily passes the eye test at 6'3'', 220 pounds with a smooth righty swing that looks like an MLB swing. I mean, his offensive power upside is no joke. He's already 24 years old, the hit tool has risk as you can see from that strikeout rate, and he's not a particularly good defensive player, but it's so easy to fall in love watching his swing. I like him, but a bench bat is probably his most reasonable outcome. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/18/65/.241/.317/.437/3

62) Abimelec Ortiz - TEX, 1B, 23.1 - I was never the high guy on Ortiz, and I kinda wrote him off after his poor first half of the season, but he redeemed himself in the 2nd half, slashing .308/.406/.570 with 15 homers, 2 steals, and a 21.1/14.2 K%/BB% in his final 60 games. He's 5'10'', 230 pounds with a howitzer of a lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. He's not a good defensive player and he was bad vs. lefties (.623 OPS in 107 PA). Tack on the hit tool risk, and it's still not a player I'm going to be super high on. But there is no doubt power in his bat, so if he does get the playing time, he's going to pop dingers. 2025 Projection: 9/3/13/.224/.291/.409/0 Prime Projection: 61/21/74/.246/.318/.451/2

63) Yohandy Morales - WAS, 1B/3B, 23.6 - The Nationals are really weak organizationally at corner infield, and they selected Morales pretty high at 40th overall, so he's in the right situation to get as much opportunity as he can handle. And he's done nothing but produce in pro ball, putting up a 119 wRC+ in 69 games at Double-A this year. It only came with 5 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.5% K%, so it was more underwhelming than the wRC+ would lead you to believe, but still. He's a big guy at 6'3'', 225 pounds with big raw power. He's not as finished of a product as you would hope for a college bat, needing to improve his game power and hit tool, but there is power potential in here, and there is a path to playing time. 2025 Projection: 16/3/18/.221/.289/.377/1 Prime Projection: 68/17/74/.244/.312/.414/5

64) Jared Thomas - COL, OF/1B, 21.9 - Selected 42nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Thomas gets the Coors bump, and he has enticing fantasy upside, but he also feels like the type of guy that Colorado never really gives a full chance to become a full time player. He performed well in his two years in the Big 12, slashing .349/.435/.635 with 16 homers, 18 steals, and a 20.6%/10.7% K%/BB% in 60 games in 2024. He's 6'2'', 190 pounds with room to tack on some more muscle, and he's a good athlete with above average speed and plus defense at 1B (he also can play CF, again showing off his athleticism). Add a star for being young for the class, and another another star for having a strong pro debut with 2 homers, 1 steal, a 19.4% K% and 146 wRC+ in 8 games at Single-A. 15/15 with 20/20 upside is in the cards here, and the hit tool will get as much help as possible in Coors. I like him relative to his lack of hype. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/71/.254/.325/.428/16

65) Cole Mathis - CHC, 1B, 21.8 - Selected 54th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Mathis is 6'1'', 210 pounds and he looks big and physical in the box with a strong and controlled righty swing. He didn't play in a major conference (CAA), but he dominated the competition put in front of him, slashing .335/.472/.650 with 14 homers, 14 steals, and a 12.6/18.1 K%/BB% in 52 games. Maybe most impressively, he obliterated the wood bat Cape league too, slashing .318/.381/.667 with 11 homers, 0 steals, and a 17.0/8.2 K%/BB% in 38 games. He's a really good all around hitter with the ability to hit for power and average, and while he's not a burner, he's definitely a good athlete. He's a good pitcher too, and while his future is likely with the bat, I wouldn't rule out a return to pitching if he doesn't develop as hoped. He didn't make his pro debut yet, he didn't face the toughest competition in college, and I prefer my 1B bats to have big time game power already, but there is plenty to like here. And despite those negatives, a smart organization took him pretty high, although I suspect part of that reason is because pitching might not end up on as much of the back burner as we think, which isn't great for fantasy. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 71/18/73/.263/.329/.427/9

66) Luis Merejo - CLE, 1B, 18.10 - Merejo put up a 147 wRC+ in the DSL in 2023, a 123 wRC+ in stateside rookie in 2024, and then finally a 145 wRC+ in 30 games at Single-A to close out the season as a barely 18 year old. The guy does nothing but produce, and at a well built 6'2", he definitely looks the part as well. He's not really excelling in any one way with a 24.8% K%, 3 homers and 3 steals in 30 games at Single-A, but with a 30.6% GB%, the power should only tick up from here. I generally like my 1B prospects to already have big game power, and his K rates, even in rookie ball, are on the high side, but his age, production, size, and lift all point towards a possible blowup in future years. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/22/79/.255/.333/.446/7

67) LaMonte Wade - SFG, 1B, 34.3 - Wade is a strong side of a platoon bat who is nearing the end of his fantasy usefulness at 34 years old. He hit .260 with 8 homers, 45 Runs and 34 RBI in 401 PA. He still put up a very good .354 xwOBA on the back of a 22.4/15.5 K%/BB%, so there are no signs of decline quite yet. He's a deep league, daily moves option only really, and add a star in OBP leagues. 2025 Projection: 56/14/48/.255/.350/.410/2

68) Carlos Santana - FRA, 1B, 39.0 – Santana hit 23 homers with a 114 wRC+ in 150 games in 2024, so even at 39 years old, he just might find a starting job. The underlying numbers back up that he's still good with an 89.2 MPH EV, 16.1 degree launch, .330 xwOBA, and 16.7/10.9 K%/BB%. Let's see where he lands. No matter what, he's obviously still a low end win now piece in medium to deeper leagues, and he's better in non 5x5 BA formats. 2025 Projection: 65/20/69/.235/.318/.417/3

69) Will Simpson - OAK, 1B, 23.7 - The good pro debut strikes again. Granted, this one slipped by even me, but Simpson isn't slipping by me anymore. He was a 15th round pick in 2023, but he stepped right into pro ball and raked with 6 homers and a .910 OPS in 36 games at mostly Single-A. In 2024, he just kept on producing, but this time he did it in the upper minors, slashing .348/.408/.493 with 2 homers, 1 steal, and a 23.7/9.2 K%/BB% in 18 games at Double-A. He destroyed High-A too with 16 homers and a 142 wRC+ in 109 games. He's 6'3'', 225 pounds with a powerful righty swing, and he can lift and pull it, so his power is legit. The bat has a high bar to clear, making the most reasonable projection as a part time power bat, but if he does get playing time, he can hit homers. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/16/64/.245/.318/.438/3

70) DJ LeMahieu - NYY, 1B/3B, 36.9 - LeMahieu is a 36 year old coming off a season where he just put up a 52 wRC+ in 67 games. He put up a 99 wRC+ the year before. Not to be Mr. Obvious, but I would say the decline has arrived. The underlying numbers have declined right along with the surface stats with a .299 xwOBA in 2024. He still gets the bat on the ball with a 15.4% K%, and the 5.8% Barrel% isn't terrible, so he can still be a solid part time player. 2025 Projection: 51/8/42/.250/.328/.385/2

71) Justin Turner - FRA, 1B, 40.4 - Turner has had a very slow and gentle decline, and I gave him a decent rank last year as a 39 year old at 354th overall, but I think this is the year where I'm not too interested even in win now mode. His BA dropped down to .259, and the .252 xBA backs that up. The power was way down too with 11 homers and a career low 87.1 MPH EV in 139 games. The 4.6% Barrel% was also a career low. He still put up a 117 wRC+, which is just a testament to how good he is, but at 40 years old, there is no guarantee he can even find a full time job. Even if he does land one, he's a very low end option. 2025 Projection: 68/15/68/.265/.340/.430/2

72) Ty France - FRA, 1B, 30.0 - I've been low on France basically every year of his career, and that came to a head in 2024 with Seattle finally pulling the plug on him being their starting 1B, designating him for assignment in July. Cincinnati picked him up out of desperation due to injuries, and even with the biggest ballpark upgrade possible (from Seattle to Cincy), he actually managed to get worse with an 82 wRC+ in 52 games. He's not a starting 1B. He's here just on the off chance he does find a starting job. He has a career .263 BA with 0 speed and about mid teens homers. Not much here. 2025 Projection: 48/11/55/.255/.322/.398/1

73) Juan Yepez - WSH, 1B, 27.1 - Roster Resource has Yepez penciled in as Washington's starting 1B, but he just isn't an MLB starting 1B. He far outperformed his underlying numbers in 2024 with a 113 wRC+ vs. a well below average .295 xwOBA. His 86.6/89.6 MPH AVG/FB EV is just bad, he didn't lift it with a 8.5 degree launch, and while the contact rates were above average, he has below average walk rates. And he's not good on defense. He's just a flier, even in super deep leagues. 2025 Projection: 41/10/44/.255/.322/.419/2

74) Niko Kavadas - LAA, 1B, 26.6 - Kavadas is likely a very low BA, bench power bat, but his power is huge enough, and he's close enough to the majors to crack this list. It's not hard to envision him becoming fantasy relevant if injuries hit, because the guy will rip dingers. He smoked 17 homers with a 92 MPH EV and 18.8 degree launch in 83 games at Triple-A, and then he hit 4 homers with a 91.7 MPH EV and 27.3 degree launch in 30 MLB games. He had a 33.4% K% at Triple-A and a 38.7% K% with a .183 BA in the majors, so the BA will tank you. He walks a ton though with a 17.3% BB% at AAA and 10.4% BB% in the majors, so in deep OBP leagues, he definitely has a chance to be useful. 2025 Projection: 23/8/26/.208/.309/.416/0

75) Blaze Jordan - BOS, 3B/1B, 22.3 - I wasn't sure Jordan deserved to crack this list with his 2nd straight year of poor performance at Double-A (98 wRC+ in 89 games), but that 12.1% K% is still pretty impressive. He has good raw power despite hitting only 7 homers, and being 21 years old at Double-A is still on the slightly young side. He doesn't have much defensive value, but he can play a decent 3B, so it's not like he doesn't have any at all. I doubt he finds a role on the Red Sox, but I'll take a shot on his contact/power combo at this point in the rankings. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/18/76/.266/.315/.421/3

76) Ethan Anderson - BAL, C/1B, 21.6 - Selected 61st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Anderson cracks this list more on the back of how weak of a catcher class it is in first year player drafts this year. I have to grade the position on a curve, and while staying away from it completely even in deep leagues is reasonable, it's nice to know your best options. Anderson is one of those options after raking all 3 years he's played in the ACC with a good feel to hit and good pop. He hit .341 with 28 homers in 178 career minor league games, and then he stepped into pro ball and kept on producing there too. He put up a 125 wRC+ in 14 games at Single-A and a 155 wRC+ in 5 games at High-A. He's a switch hitter and he's young for the class, two things that can portend a bit more potential than a typical college selection, and he's got good size at 6'2'', 215 pounds with a swing geared towards lift. There is no guarantee he can stick at catcher, but there are definitely things to like about Anderson. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 55/14/55/.263/.329/.411/4

77) Edward Florentino - PIT, 1B/OF, 18.5 - Florentino is a big dude at 6'4'', 200 pounds, and he signed for a not bad $395,000 in last year's international class. He played a bunch of CF along with 1B, so while his glove isn't expected to be an asset, he could end up a solid corner outfielder. And of course, we are buying the bat here with big raw power and excellent production in his pro debut in the DSL. He slashed .260/.432/.459 with 5 homers, 8 steals, and a 18.9/20.0 K%/BB% in 49 games. He put the ball in the air a ton with a 30.5% GB%. He's setting up to be your classic three true outcome slugger. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/26/83/.246/.328/.453/6

78) Justin Gonzales - BOS, 1B/OF, 18.3 - Like Florentio, Gonzales is a big dude at 6'4'', 210 pounds, and he signed for $250,000 in last year's international class despite limited defensive value. That means the Red Sox liked his bat a lot, and I'm sure they like it even more after his excellent pro debut in the DSL, slashing .320/.391/.517 with 5 homers, 8 steals, and a 10.4/9.9 K%/BB% in 47 games. He hit the ball on the ground too much to fully get to his big raw power, but his contact/power combo is impressive. Obviously so much risk with DSL guys and lack of defensive value, but the upside on the bat is good enough to slot in here. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 74/22/81/.266/.326/.447/6

79) Seth Brown - OAK, 1B/OF, 32.9 - Brown is in a strong side of a platoon role, but I think his time is coming up on even that. He's not a good defensive player, he's going to turn 33 during the season, and he put up his 2nd straight season with a 91 wRC+. That isn't a starter. He still hits the ball hard with a 90 MPH EV, which can keep him relevant, but the contact rates and plate approach are poor. It's time to give the kids a shot. 2025 Projection: 35/12/41/.228/.290/.419/4

80) Jonah Bride - MIA, 1B, 29.3 - McBride was Miami's starting 1B/DH in the 2nd half of the season, and despite putting up a 123 wRC+ with 11 homers in 71 games, and despite him currently penciled in for the job, I'm not buying. His .297 xwOBA and 87.1 MPH EV tell a different story, and with a mediocre 11.8 degree launch, it's not like there are going to be a ton of homers. The 20.2/11.0 K%/BB% is solid, but the .224 xBA shows you can't count on a high BA either. He's a bench bat at best. De Los Santos is going to take that 1B job possibly from opening day. 2025 Projection: 31/9/36/.243/.317/.410/1

81) Anthony Rizzo - FRA, 1B, 35.9 - Rizzo's career is nearing it's end, or is possibly at it's end. He has never been the same after his concussion in late May 2023. He put up a 84 wRC+ in 92 games in 2024 with the career low 4% Barrel% to back it up. I don't see why a team would give him a starting job, but he's here on the chance he finds one. 2025 Projection: 36/9/33/.235/.308/.394/0

82) Nathan Martorella - MIA, 1B, 24.1 - Italian Snack couldn't keep up his production in the upper minors with a 104 wRC+ in 127 games at Double-A, and with a 1B bat like this, that is basically a death knell for his prospect status. Your bat needs to be bulletproof. But he still displayed a solid hit/power combo with 18 homers and a 18.2/9.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, so he'll get the most out of his above average raw power, and there is opportunity in Miami. He's only a deep league option right now though. 2025 Projection: 15/3/17/.243/.302/.381/1 Prime Projection: 38/10/41/.258/.320/.425/3

83) Damiano Palmegiani - TOR, 3B/1B, 25.2 - Maybe Palmegiani doesn't deserve to crack this list with a 82 wRC+ in 123 games at Triple-A as a 24 year old, but the power upside is in here if he works his way into a shot, which would make him fantasy relevant. He hit 19 homers with an 89.3 MPH EV, 19.4 degree launch, and a 53.6% Pull%. The .210 BA and 28.1% K% is why the wRC+ was so low, and that probably does limit is reasonable upside projection to a bench bat. He's a righty that didn't hit righties that well either (.648 OPS), so it's also a short side of a platoon bench bat. First Base seems especially weak to me up and down the rankings, so he also cracks this list purely on scarcity. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.218/.292/.400/0 Prime Projection: 36/12/42/.231/.316/.436/2
