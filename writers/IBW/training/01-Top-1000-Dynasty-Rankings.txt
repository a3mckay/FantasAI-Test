1) Shohei Ohtani - LAD, RHP/DH, 30.9 - Ohtani was the no brainer #1 overall dynasty asset in the game before he tore his non pitching shoulder in the World Series. Now it's not so easy. He's expected to be ready to DH by Opening Day, but it will push his pitching debut into May at the earliest. Shoulder surgery which takes your rehab right up to the start of the season is also not a great recipe for success in general. Considering he's 30 years old, it has me teetering on whether he deserves this top spot, but he's just so far out ahead of the pack assuming full health, that I can't move off him. He just went .310/54/59 as a hitter only, finishing as the #1 fantasy player in the game by a country mile (shouldn't the expression be a city mile? Try driving a mile in New York City, it will take you about 30 minutes. In the country? 50 seconds). And now in 2025, the throwing elbow is expected to be fully healthy after undergoing an internal brace procedure, or whatever super secret elbow surgery he underwent. His elbow was healthy enough to even hear murmurs he could have pitched this post-season. And when healthy, he is a true ace with a 3.01 ERA and 31.2/8.9 K%/BB% in 481.2 career IP. It's his 2nd major elbow surgery in 5 years, but I'm not betting against a super human talent like Ohtani, and the same goes for the shoulder surgery. I just can't bring myself to bet against the true GOAT. Health is clearly a risk, but even factoring in that extra risk, he is so far and away the best fantasy player in the game that he still lands at #1. - 2025 Projection: 105/40/101/.283/.371/.562/25 // 9/3.41/1.19/142 in 120 IP

2) Bobby Witt Jr. - KCR, SS, 24.10 - In leagues where Ohtani can't be used as both a pitcher and hitter (weekly leagues or leagues where Ohtani is split into two players), age does start to become more of a factor, so in those leagues, Bobby Witt Jr. would be crowned the #1 dynasty player in the game. Coming off his rookie season in 2022, he improved in almost every facet of the game in 2023, and then he once again improved in every facet of the game in 2024. Someone tell Bobby that development isn't linear, because his development is a straight line. He put up career bests in Barrel% (14.3%), EV (92.7 MPH), Max EV (116.9 MPH), xwOBA (.413), K% (15%), and BB% (8.0%). His 74.7 MPH bat speed is elite, which makes his contact rates even more impressive, because that bat speed/contact combo is in even more rarified air. He's also the fastest man in baseball by a good margin with a 30.5 ft/sec sprint. It all resulted in a .332/32/31 season, and seeing how he's only gotten better every single season, there might just be another level in here. 40/40 here we come. - 2025 Projection: 118/35/104/.315/.379/.555/39

3) Elly De La Cruz - CIN, SS, 23.3 - Risk? What risk? I laugh in the face risk, ranking Elly 9th overall last off-season, and finishing his blurb by writing, "I always say, 'if you can’t take risks in fantasy, where can you take risks,' and I’m not even sure Elly is as risky as people think. I’m all in." That not so risky risk paid off in a huge way in 2024 with Elly going .259/25/67. Those 67 steals led the league by a large margin, lapping most of the field. He's one of, if not the most electric player in the game at 6'5'' with an elite 75.2 MPH swing (his lefty swing is super elite, while his righty swing is more near elite) and 30.0/sec sprint speed. He crushes the ball with a 91.8 MPH EV, he brought his launch up as expected to a respectable 9.7 degrees, he brought his chase down to an above average 26.9%, and he kept his strikeout rate in a reasonable enough range (31.3%) to let the insane talent shine. And this is just the beginning. If he can continue to improve his plate skills and raise that launch, which I wouldn't see why that isn't the expectation at just 23 years old, I shutter to think about what kind of numbers are possible. - 2025 Projection: 110/31/89/.267/.348/.515/59

4) Gunnar Henderson - BAL, SS, 23.9 - Henderson massively improved on basically the only three weaknesses of his game in 2024, which easily propelled him into a Top 5 dynasty asset. He put up a .829 OPS vs. lefties in 2024 after a notching a lowly .618 OPS in 2023. I never let Gunnar's struggles vs. lefties hold his ranking back, even when it was a major point of contention in is his prospect years, and I think it's something to keep in mind when evaluating lefty hitting prospects. You often don't get that many reps against lefties, so you often see that skill develop over time when they get into the majors. Don't let it scare you off. He also improved his base stealing, nabbing 21 bags in 25 attempts after stealing only 10 bags in 2023. Granted this one was more a fantasy skill than a real life skill, as he was an excellent base runner overall in both years. And finally, he improved his hit tool, putting up a 22.1% K%, 24.4% whiff%, and a .281 BA. He combined all of those improvements while continuing to smash the ball with a 92.8 MPH EV, leading to 37 homers. He still doesn't steal quite enough to pop him over Witt or Elly, but he is right there with those guys, and if steals are devalued in your league, like in points or 6+ hitting category leagues, Gunnar would slid in ahead of Elly. - 2025 Projection: 116/35/99/.280/.370/.535/18

5) Juan Soto - NYM, OF, 26.5 - Soto didn't give the Yanks even the slightest bit of deference, going to the highest bidder in the New York Mets, signing for 15 years and $765 million (the Yanks reportedly offered 16 years for $760 million). He's just a subway ride away from his new digs ... or more accurately, just a chauffeured ride away ... or probably even more accurately, just a helicopter ride away. For a super elite hitter like Soto, ballpark doesn't really matter, but the most interesting part of this move is how much he changed his hitting profile for Yankee Stadium's short porch.  He put up a career high by far 45.1% Pull% (38.9% in 2023), and it led to a career high 41 homers. The Yanks were the 3rd best park for lefty homers last year, while the Mets were 10th worst. Will Soto continue to pull the ball that much? Or will he decide to go back to his career norms? My guess is that he keeps on pulling it, because he actually hit one more homer on the road than he did at home. It seems Yankee Stadium gave him the push to unlock more homer power regardless of ballpark, and I don't see why he would want to go back. His 19.7% Barrel%, 94.2 MPH EV, and 57% Hard Hit% were all career highs. His Statcast expected homer totals were 46 for Yankee Stadium and the exact same 46 for Citi Field, again underscoring that he is ballpark proof. The only thing he doesn't do is steal bases with only 7 steals, and that is what keeps him just a smidge behind Witt, Elly and Gunnar. 2025 Projection: 118/35/105/.289/.418/.539/9

Shadow5) Shohei Ohtani - LAD, DH only/Weekly Leagues, 30.9 - This is where I would rank Ohtani in weekly lineup leagues or as a hitter only. Without the pitching to put him over the top, the age does come into play here a bit. And it's hard not to have that shoulder surgery in the back of your mind too. - 2025 Projection: 2025 Projection: 105/40/101/.283/.371/.562/25

6) Corbin Carroll - ARI, OF, 24.7 - Back when Carroll was in the throes of his awful start, I made a decree by Fantasy Law to not sell low in one of my Dynasty Baseball Rundowns, writing, "'The captain goes down with the ship.' That’s just Maritime Law. Now, I’m no sailor, but as the world’s foremost expert on Fantasy Law, there are some players that you are required to go down with the ship for, and Corbin Carroll is most certainly one of those players. I’ve seen a ton of panic and sell low offers for Carroll, but all of the warning signs could be flashing red, the sirens could be blaring, and you are still legally obligated to not sell low on an established elite dynasty asset like Carroll." He continued to struggle for a bit after writing that, but before long, he did indeed turn that ship around, slashing .258/.351/.577 with 20 homers, 20 steals, and a 10.6/11.3 K%/BB% in his final 71 games. He smashed the ball with a 91.3 MPH EV and 14.6 degree launch over that time. I would say any lingering concern over his shoulder injury can be put to rest, cementing Carroll as a truly elite dynasty asset with standout contact, approach, power, and speed. He's the total package. Don't be scared off by the poor first half. - 2025 Projection: 119/28/84/.270/.357/.519/42

7) Kyle Tucker - CHC, OF, 28.2 - A fractured shin knocked Tucker out for half the season, but he put up a 1.041 OPS in 18 games after returning, so there is zero concern about the injury long term. I guess the one area of his game where maybe you can get a little nervous about is stolen bases. He only stole one bag in those 18 games, and he put up a career low 26.0 ft/sec sprint, which is in the bottom 18% of the league. He's never been fast but he's always been an excellent base stealer, so I'm not sure I'm extra worried about it, but he does kinda feel like the type of player who may not steal as much as he gets into his 30's. He's not there yet at only 28, but it might be something to keep in mind. Steals aside, he does feel like the type of player who will rake deep into his 30's. He only played in 78 games, but it was the best year of his career with a 180 wRC+ that came on the back of a career high by far 16.5% BB% (11.9% in 2023). He also hit 23 homers with 11 steals, and if you double that over a full season pace, that is 46 homers with 22 steals if my math is correct ... carry the 1. He's been one of the most consistently great players of his generation. Almost too consistent as he semes to get taken for granted. - 2025 Projection: 102/34/109/.285/.378/.533/24

8) Aaron Judge - NYY, OF, 32.11 - In pure win now mode, I can see ranking Judge 2nd overall, but with him turning 33 years old just one month into the 2025 season, age starts to move a little more to the forefront of my mind. 33 years old is generally the number for me when I maybe start to explore sell opportunities if I want to rebuild or retool, so while I'm not saying to sell Judge, it's the reason why he isn't ranked even higher coming off his massive season. His 218 wRC+ was the best in baseball by a massive margin. The only players to put up a higher wRC+ in a season are Barry Bonds (3x), Babe Ruth (3x), Ted Williams (2x), and Roger Hornsby (1x). I mean, do I need to say more? No. No I don't. - 2025 Projection: 112/50/128/.293/.422/.661/10

9) Fernando Tatis Jr. - SDP, OF, 26.3 - Tatis proved without a shadow of a doubt that he is not going to fade into mediocrity after his relatively down 2023 season coming off the PED suspension and multiple surgeries (not that I had much doubt, ranking him 6th overall last off-season). He demolished the ball with a 93.5 MPH EV, 14.5% Barrel%, .393 xwOBA, and a 55.1% Hard Hit% which was in the top 1% of baseball. Not only were his power metrics in prime form, but his 21.9% K% was a career best. He missed over two months with a stress reaction in his leg, which I guess you can add to his "injury risk" pile, but he was fine when he returned in September, and he went nuclear in the playoffs too with 4 homers in 7 games. It all resulted in 25 homers with a .280 BA in 109 games (including the playoffs). That is about a 35 homer pace over a full season. The one area where the injuries did seem to take their toll was on the bases. He only stole 11 bases on 14 attempts and his sprint speed tanked to 28.4 ft/sec (29.3 in 2023). Maybe you can blame the leg injury, but he wasn't running much before that injury, and I'm not sure how you can blame the wrist/shoulder injuries for him getting slower, especially since he was fine in 2023. How much he's going to run in the future is the wild card in this profile, and that question, along with some continued injury risk, is enough to nudge him just outside of the of that Top 5-ish area into the Top 10 area. - 2025 Projection: 96/33/89/.283/.348/.529/18

10) Ronald Acuna Jr. - ATL, OF, 27.3 - Acuna tore his right ACL in 2021 and now he's torn his left ACL in 2024. Since that first torn ACL, he's been in the process of slowing down with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint in 2021, a 28.5 ft/sec sprint in 2022, a 28.0 ft/sec sprint in 2023 and finally a 27.7 ft/sec sprint in 2024. And now coming off this 2nd ACL tear, I don't think there is any question at all that Acuna is not going to be the athlete he was in his prime. Even with the lowest sprint speed of his career, he still stole 16 bases in 49 games, which is about a 48 steal pace, so I don't think he is all of a sudden going to stop running, but let's see how he looks coming off this 2nd major knee injury. He was also in the midst of the worst season of his career before going down with the injury. He hit only 4 homers with a .716 OPS. He was definitely getting unlucky as he was crushing the ball with a 92.2 MPH EV, but even his .348 xwOBA was a career low by far. He wasn't able to maintain any of the contact gains from 2023 with his K% jumping back up to 23.9% (11.4% in 2023). After the first ACL tear, Acuna's first year back wasn't particularly great with 15 homers and a 115 wRC+ in 119 games in 2022, so keep that in mind for 2025. He had a historic season in 2023 of course, so the hope is that he can do the same eventually after this one, but this one will be his 2nd, and it's hard for me to completely ignore it. He's also expected to miss about a third of the season in 2025. Acuna is the type of talent you want to keep betting on no matter what the circumstances are, but I'm definitely a little concerned. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/63/.272/.363/.524/20

11) Julio Rodriguez - SEA, OF, 24.3 - The Slow Start King is going to give his dynasty owners a massive coronary event if he gets off to yet another slow start in 2025. He seriously needs to figure something out this off-season. Treat Spring Training like it's the regular season? Ramp up earlier? I don't know the answer because I don't know what his off-season routine is, but he needs to do something differently. He put up a .616 OPS in his first 87 games before exploding after that, slashing .318/.371/.543 with 13 homers, 7 steals, and a 23.3/6.5 K%/BB% in his final 56 games. He's far too talented to be too scared off by the slow starts. His 76.3 MPH swing is the 9th fastest in baseball. He crushes the ball with a 91.7 MPH EV and he has elite speed with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint. The one area of his game which is preventing him from joining the true elites, especially as a real life hitter, are his plate skills. It's yet to improve at all in his 3 years in the majors with a 30.9% whiff% and 37.4% Chase% (25.4/6.2 K%/BB%). He can thrive in fantasy especially even without that improving at all, but if that can take a step forward, we may not have seen the best of Julio yet. - 2025 Projection: 100/31/100/.281/.342/.490/32

12) James Wood - WAS, OF, 22.7 - I don't need to do any deep victory lap philosophizing when it comes to if James Wood is a hit for me (see my 19 Dynasty Baseball Strategies/Thoughts for 2025 for more thoughts on victory lapping in dynasty), because I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I can victory lap the hell out of James Wood. I named him a major First Year Player Draft Target in his draft year, and then I ranked him all the way up at 68th overall in the 2024 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings. I couldn't help but buy into that beastly power/speed combo from a 6'7'' frame, and the swing was always short enough to bet on the hit tool ending up good enough. And that is exactly how it played out in his rookie year with an elite 92.8/96.9 MPH AVG/FB EV, a plus 28.7 ft/sec sprint, a well above average 21% Chase%, and a not in the true danger zone 29.6% whiff%. It resulted in 9 homers, 14 steals, a .264 BA and a 120 wRC+ in 79 games. The 2.4 degree launch subdued the homer power a bit, but he hits the ball so hard that he's launch proof, and that number is certainly coming up in the future. He's basically Elly De La Cruz with better plate skills and half as many steals. Do not even think about valuing Wood as anything but a near elite dynasty asset this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 89/24/87/.251/.346/.474/26 Prime Projection: 105/32/105/.268/.364/.518/28

13) Jackson Chourio - MIL, OF, 21.1 - I spent most of my waking hours last off-season agonizing over who to place as the #1 prospect in baseball between Chourio, Holliday and Langford. And honestly, it wasn't only waking hours, I was dreaming of a Chourio 20/20 rookie season in my sleep. I trusted the voices I was getting from the baseball gods, placing Chourio first overall on my prospect rankings, and projecting his 2024 stat line for 21 homers, 22 steals, 75 RBI, a .320 OBP and a .469 SLG in my 2024 Top 1,000 Rankings. And as we know, he ended up outdoing Langford by a solid amount and Holliday by a city mile, hitting 21 homers with 25 steals, 79 RBI, a .327 OBP and a .464 SLG. Damn, it's almost like I really did see his future stat line in my dreams (and yes, I'm not mentioning batting average or runs because I didn't nail those ha). He hit the ball very hard with a 89.7 MPH EV, he had elite speed with a 29.7 ft/sec sprint, and he had a slightly above average 21.1% K%. And all of those numbers include his rough first 2 months of the season. If you just look at his last 4 months, which is reasonable considering he was a 20 year old rookie just finding his MLB sea legs, his numbers get even more impressive, slashing .305/.360/.527 with 16 homers, 15 steals, and a 18.4/7.3 K%/BB% in his final 97 games. There is some room for improvement with his plate approach (below average 31.9% Chase%) and launch (7.6 degrees), but neither of those are too bad to begin with, and he has the profile to make that work even if he can't improve it. But he'll barely be 21 years old next season, so I don't see why we wouldn't expect all areas of his game to improve. Wood vs. Chourio is a coin flip for me, but I gave the edge to Wood because he hits the ball harder and chases less. - 2025 Projection: 93/26/89/.285/.339/.488/28

14) Wyatt Langford - TEX, OF, 23.5 - Langford's surface stats don't jump off the page with a .253 BA, .740 OPS, 16 homers, and 19 steals in 134 games, but his underlying skills were jumping off the page all season, and it finally showed in September. He went bonkos to close out the season, slashing .289/.372/.579 with 9 homers, 7 steals, and a 19.0/10.2 K%/BB% in his final 32 games. Even if you pull it back to June 3rd, he had a .804 OPS with 15 homers and 18 steals in his final 98 games. And like I mentioned, the underlying skills are super impressive. He hits the ball very hard with a 9.3% Barrel% and 89.6 MPH EV (91.3 MPH EV in those final 32 games). He lifts it with a 16.6 degree launch, he has elite speed with a 29.8 ft/sec sprint, he has above average contact rates (22.9% whiff% and 20.6% K%), and he has an above average plate approach (23% Chase% with a 9.2% BB%). The cherry on top is that his 74.5 MPH swing is nearly elite, and it's a short swing too with 7 foot length. That swing speed/length combo is special. Only Heliot Ramos swings a faster bat with a shorter swing. He's going to explode in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 89/26/93/.274/.352/.481/24

15) Jackson Merrill - SDP, OF, 21.11 - Merrill's ability to raise his launch angle considerably, while not losing even a smidge of contact prowess, is nothing short of incredible. He went from putting up a 59.9% GB% with a 19.2% K% at Single-A in 2022 to putting up a 35.9% GB% with a 17% K% in the majors in 2024. Justin Crawford better be blowing up his celly round the clock to get some pointers on how he did it. It resulted in Merrill having one of, if the not the best rookie season in baseball, slashing .292/.326/.500 with 24 homers, 16 steals, and a 17.0/4.9 K%/BB% in 156 games. The underlying numbers back it all up with a 11.3% Barrel%, 90.4 MPH EV, and a .376 xwOBA. The only area of his game to quibble with is that he's never walked a ton, and he chased a lot with a 34.4% Chase%. He's also never been a huge base stealer in his career, but I don't think him stealing 20+ bags is out of the question at all. He's an easy elite dynasty asset, and he's in a tier with James Wood, Jackson Chourio, Paul Skenes, and Wyatt Langford as the top rookies in the game. - 2025 Projection: 86/25/92/.288/.336/.492/19

16) Yordan Alvarez - HOU, OF, 27.9 - Yordan had to go ahead and put his surgically repaired knees back in our mind right at the end of 2024, tweaking his knee after sliding into 2nd base on September 22nd, which ended his regular season. He returned for the playoffs, so it's not a big deal, but any knee injury is going to have our minds racing, thinking about if they are going to become a concern as he starts to age. The good news is that he's only 27 years old, so I wouldn't worry about it quite yet. He's as consistent as they come with beastly season after beastly season. He slashed .308/.392/.567 with 35 homers, a career high 6 steals, and a 15.0/10.9 K%/BB% in 147 games. There are zero concerns about him over the short term, but I do think the knees are something to at least keep in the back of your mind down the line. - 2025 Projection: 91/35/100/.303/.405/.579/3

17) Vladimir Guerrero Jr. - TOR, 1B, 25.6 - We can finally put the "Vlad has only had a great year in a minor league ballpark" narrative to rest. His 165 wRC+ this year was almost identical to the 166 mark he put up in 2021. Granted he hit 48 homers in the minor league park and only 30 this year, but still. His underlying numbers were screaming that he was legitimately elite despite the relatively mediocre surface stats in 2023, so his big year really isn't that surprising. I don't have a fancy bat speed + contact rate stat to give you, but if I did, Vlad, Yordan, and Soto would be the cream of the crop. Vlad swung a 75.9 MPH bat with a 13.8/10.3 K%/BB%. And he crushes the ball with a 93.8 MPH EV. The 7.4 degree launch is still subduing the homer power a bit, and he doesn't run much with only 2 steals, so I wouldn't quite call him a truly elite dynasty asset, but he's not far off. - 2025 Projection: 99/32/109/.308/.383/.528/4

18) Jose Ramirez - CLE, 3B, 32.6 - Ramirez had the quietest 39/41 season of all time. Barely heard about it. The pomp and circumstance around Ohtani was too loud for anyone else to get their fair due. Or maybe it's because he doesn't play in a large market that Ramirez' entire spectacular career doesn't really get the respect he deserves. He's only 5'9''. He doesn't smash the ball like the true giants of the game. He doesn't have elite speed. He doesn't swing the fastest bat. He's an everyman who quietly goes about his business with elite season after elite season. He does it with elite contact skills (12% K%), elite lift (19.6 degree launch) and elite pull ability (52.8% Pull%). He also hits the ball plenty hard with an 89.2 MPH EV. The only question is how long can he do it for at 32 years old. He obviously showed zero signs of slowing down in 2024, and like I mentioned in the Aaron Judge blurb, 33 years old is really the first year I start to seriously consider selling elite players like this. I'm not going to dock him for his age too much. He's an elite win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 102/33/106/.280/.344/.520/33

19) Paul Skenes - PIT, RHP, 22.10 - While this is far from the most impressive part of Skenes game, I've just been having a lot of fun diving into the new bat tracking data, and of course Skenes ranks towards the top of those leaderboards as well. The disparity amongst pitcher's induced swing speed is obviously much less than the disparity between hitters, but I still find it interesting. Skenes had the 8th best swing speed against amongst qualified pitchers at 70.9 MPH. The only qualified starter to induce slower swings was Chris Sale, and Will Vest led of all baseball amongst qualified pitchers. That's just the cherry on top of his elite profile. He throws a 6 pitch mix, and all of them range from above average to elite. His 94 MPH sinker was the most valuable sinker in baseball with a +18 run value. His 98.8 MPH 4-seamer notched a +6 run value, the curveball notched a +2, the sweeper was at +5, the changeup at +2, and while the slider was his only negative value pitch at -2, that was only because he got unlucky on the pitch with a .229 xwOBA. He combined that filth with plus command which led to a 1.96 ERA and 33.1/6.2 K%/BB% in 133 IP. He's the easiest #1 dynasty pitcher in the game ranking I've ever made since  ... 2024. Spencer Strider was a damn easy call last off-season, and he's a perfect example of the only thing that can go wrong, injuries. Pitchers break, and pitchers who throw upper 90's seem to break even more. You can't play scared, and you need good pitchers to win, but it's why I can't rank any pitcher higher than around Top 20-ish overall on the Dynasty Rankings. They are just inherently too risky. - 2025 Projection: 15/2.77/0.98/227 in 185 IP

20) Bryce Harper - PHI, 1B, 32.5 - You can find some things here and there which maybe can look like small red flags in hindsight if Harper does start to decline, like a nearly career worst in xwOBA (.361), Barrel% (10.6%), and sprint speed (27.4 ft/sec), but I think that is simply slicing and dicing the numbers too much when it comes to a proven stud like Harper. And none of those marks were too bad or too far off from career norms. His 145 wRC+ was a 3 year high and slightly better than his 142 career wRC+. He crushes the ball with a 91.1 MPH EV and he has a strong plate approach with a 21.9/12.0 K%/BB%. It doesn't seem like we can count on more than a handful of steals anymore (7 steals), but he strikes me as the type who could rake well into his late 30's. I wouldn't be thinking about selling Harper off quite yet. - 2025 Projection: 98/33/99/.287/.382/.520/10

21) Mookie Betts - LAD, 2B/OF, 32.6 - Betts is the leader of the Slow Bat Speed Kings with a 69 MPH swing that is 442nd "best" in baseball (minimum 50 swings). But he proves swinging an electric bat isn't the only path to success. He had another great season which was only interrupted by a fractured hand in mid June, slashing .289/.372/.491 with 19 homers, 16 steals, and a 11.0/11.8 K%/BB% in 116 games. He has 4 dingers in 11 post season games and counting. The 11% K% tied a career best, and his 16 steals tied for a 6 year best. The 26.7 ft/sec sprint was a career low and in the bottom 30% of the league, so while there certainly seems to be some physical decline, it hasn't impacted his stats quite yet. Like I've been saying with elite players like this, 33 years old is when I start to think about selling, so I'm running it back in 2025 with Mookie. 2025 Projection: 110/32/100/.290/.370/.525/18

22) Francisco Lindor - NYM, SS, 31.4 - Lindor gutted it out with a back injury to close out the season and into playoffs, requiring extra injections to get back on the field, and while I respect the hell out of his heart (130 wRC+ in 13 playoff games), I do hope it's something that doesn't come back to bite him early in 2025. Sometimes things like that can throw off your normal off-season routine, creating an uphill battle all season. While it's something to think about, it would be much too cautious to plan on Lindor being anything other than a stud next year. After going 31/31 in 2023, he followed that up in 2024 with a 33/29 season. His 137 wRC+, 13.6% Barrel% and .382 xwOBA were all career highs. As long as the back isn't an issue, I don't see why he wouldn't go 30/30 again. If the back is an issue, there is a chance he doesn't run quite as much. 2025 Projection: 103/31/94/.268/.340/.485/26

23) Jarren Duran - BOS, OF, 28.7 - Duran's hit tool and plate approach have improved every year of his 4 year career, and considering how electric of a player he is, that is all he need to go nuclear. He slashed .285/.342/.492 with 21 homers, 34 steals and a 21.8/7.3 K%/BB% in 160 games. He has elite speed with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint, he hits the ball very hard with a 90.8 MPH EV, and he has plus bat speed with a 73.6 MPH swing. There is absolutely nothing in the underlying numbers to say this year was a fluke, and with how he's improved every year of his career (48 wRC+ in 2021, 77 wRC+ in 2022, 120 wRC+ in 2023, 129 wRC+ in 2024), who is to say he can't do it again in 2025. I'm all in. 2025 Projection: 101/23/83/.280/.341/.476/33

24) Oneil Cruz - PIT, OF/SS, 26.6 - Saying that Cruz' 95.5 MPH EV is elite would be an understatement. It is in all time great territory, trailing only Judge and Ohtani, two all time greats. His 78.6 MPH swing speed is also super elite, trailing only Giancarlo Stanton's 81.2 MPH swing (Stanton laps the field, with nobody even close to him). And he also has double plus speed with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint speed. This is an extremely special talent. Yes, there is hit tool risk with a 34.1% whiff% and 30.1% K%, but I really don't think it's as risky at it seems. He hit .259 this year with a .266 xBA, and in 1,009 career PA he has a .250 BA. He can clearly thrive with the elevated swing and miss. He put together a strong year in 2024 with 21 homers and 22 steals in 23 attempts in 146 games, but he is merely just scratching the surface of what he's capable of. He was a major target coming into the year, and he turned into an elite dynasty asset. Make sure you treat him like one this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/92/.255/.328/.474/26

25) CJ Abrams - WAS, SS, 24.6 - Washington sent Abrams to his room at the end of the season like an unruly teenager to think about what he's done after partying at a casino until 8 AM when he had a 1 PM game. Maybe he was exhibiting this type of behavior all season and it was a long time coming. But maybe this is also what a normal 23/24 year old does, and at that point of the season, the Nationals were so far out of it. I say give the kid a break, but either way, I'm not letting it impact his considerable dynasty value. His power has been slowly but surely ticking up with a 90.9 MPH FB/LD EV in 2022, followed by a 92.6 MPH FB/LD EV in 2023, and finally putting up a very respectable 93.6 MPH FB/LD EV in 2024. It resulted in his first 20 homer season in 138 games, and at a still wiry 6'2'' with a 15.1 degree launch, this is just the beginning of his power ascension as he enters his mid 20's. He wasn't as good on the bases this year as he was in 2023 (31 for 43), but he finished the season 17 for 19 on steal attempts in his final 52 games, so I think that was just a small sample aberration. And really his biggest demerit is that the plate skills haven't shown any improvement since he broke into the majors with a 21.3/6.6 K%/BB% and 35.4% Chase%. He can be an easy top 50 dynasty asset even if the plate approach never improves, putting up several 20/30 seasons, but if he wants to take the next step into elite status, he needs to improve in that area. And entering his age 24 year old season, I don't see why we shouldn't expect improvement there. Abrams is just getting started. - 2025 Projection: 89/23/76/.263/.329/.450/35

26) Trea Turner - PHI, SS, 31.9 - Turner has two big red flags as he gets deeper into his 30's. The first one is that speed first players don't tend to age as well as power first players. The second one is that he also chases a lot with a 33.9% Chase% and 5.0% BB%, and high chase players also don't tend to age well. His 71.7 MPH swing speed is very slightly above average, so if that starts to fall, along with his foot speed as he gets older, it could spell trouble. The reasons to not panic too much are that while he's a speed first player, he also hits the ball hard with an 89.1 MPH EV. He's always had above average K rates with a 18.2% K%, the speed is still elite with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint, and he strikes me as the type of elite base stealer who will be stealing bases until they rip the uniform off him. He's also only 31 years old, so we are still a few years away from really getting worried about a skills decline. If you're rebuilding, Turner definitely makes sense to explore trade possibilities on, but if you are only getting low ball-ish offers, I wouldn't be pressed to sell. I would wait for him to be putting up big numbers in 2025, and then explore the trade market again at that point. - 2025 Projection: 98/25/79/.290/.339/.472/28

27) Jazz Chisholm - NYY, 3B/OF, 27.2 - I ranked Jazz 34th overall on the 2024 Top 1,000, absolutely refusing to fade a player with such a beastly power/speed combo, and named him a major target, writing, "Buy the injury discount. His proven upside is way way way too high to let your fear control you. He was on a 30/30 pace this year. The hit tool isn't great, but he has 1,193 PA with a .245 BA. That is a large enough sample where I'm not too worried about the bottom falling out. If you want to shy away from mediocre talents due to injury concern, that is fine with me. Even shying away from good talents is reasonable. But you don't shy away from near elite talents like Chisholm." And what he just did in 2024 is why you don't fade this kind of talent. He slashed .256/.324/.436 with 24 homers, 40 steals, and a 24.5/8.5 K%/BB% in 147 games. He was playing well with the Marlins, but he exploded when he got the Yanks with 11 homers, 18 steals and a 132 wRC+ in 46 games. It's not even that he hit particularly well at Yankee Stadium, it just seemed to light a fire under him, but for sure it's also a big home field upgrade for him. And the most important thing of all is that he stayed healthy. Health is the main reason why people faded him, and unfortunately, it still has to be taken into account in his price. Staying healthy one season is good, but he needs to go back to back healthy seasons for me to take "injury risk" off his resume, or at least have it downplayed. We saw Robert stay basically healthy in 2023, only to again miss a large chunk of the season in 2024. Jazz could easily follow that same path. If not for injury risk, Jazz has an argument for Top 15 status, so this ranking does factor in a bit of risk. - 2025 Projection: 87/25/84/.252/.323/.455/33

28) Tarik Skubal - DET, LHP, 28.4 - I was all in on Skubal's 80.1 IP explosion in 2023, ranking him 59th overall on the 2024 Top 1,000, and placing a futures bet on him to lead the league in strikeouts ($10 to win $800). He not only led all of baseball with 228 strikeouts, but he was also the #1 fantasy pitcher in the game with a 2.39 ERA and 30.3/4.6 K%/BB% in 192 IP. His 96.8 MPH fastball was up another tick from last year and was the 4th most valuable 4-seamer in the game. His changeup is elite with a 46.1% whiff%. His 96.6 MPH sinker was the 24th most valuable sinker in baseball. And his slider was above average. Tack on elite control and you have one of the very best pitchers in baseball. It really wouldn't be crazy at all to have him above Skenes as the top dog. - 2025 Projection: 16/2.82/0.96/220 in 185 IP

29) Garrett Crochet – BOS, LHP, 25.9 – Paul Skenes is the no doubt #1 dynasty pitcher in the game. I’m not arguing that … buuuuuuuuuuuut … what if Crochet is actually better than him? He put up a better K% (35.1% vs. 33.1%), BB% (5.5% vs. 6.2%), Chase% (33.5% vs. 30.9%), and a much better whiff% (33.0% vs. 28.7%). His 97.2 MPH 4-seamer put up a 31.4% whiff% while Skenes’ 98.8 MPH 4-seamer put up a 24.2% whiff%. Crochet’s cutter put up a 32.7% whiff% while Skenes’ sinker notched a 29.3% whiff%. Crochet’s sweeper notched a 42.7% whiff% while Skenes’ sweeper notched a 22.6% whiff% and his curve notched a 33.7% whiff%. They are both beastly athletes. I described the 6’6”, 245 pound Crochet as a WWE Ballerina in my March Mailbag Podcast. With Chicago, he couldn’t touch Skenes in wins, but he’s in Boston now, and just judging who is the better pitcher, I wouldn’t be so sure the answer is Skenes. Now, Skenes dusted him on ERA (3.58 vs. 1.96), and even though their xERA’s were much much closer (2.83 vs. 2.50), I do think that matters. Crochet also has more of a track record of control problems than Skenes does. Like I said, Skenes is the undeniable #1 dynasty pitcher in the game … but maybe … he won’t be at the end of 2025. – 2025 Projection: 15/3.03/1.03/230 in 170 IP

30) Austin Riley - ATL, 3B, 28.1 - Riley seemingly had a down year on the surface with a 116 wRC+ in 110 games, but there is not a single thing to be worried about. His .366 xwOBA was much better than his .338 wOBA, and was in the top 8% of baseball. He was also in the midst of bringing up his season numbers to career norms with a .942 OPS in his last 57 games before his regular season ended with a right hand fracture in mid August. His 93.3 MPH EV and 53.4% Hard Hit% were actually career highs by a good margin, so he's never hit the ball harder. Have zero concern about Riley moving forward. He'll do his usual .275 BA with 35 homer thing in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 96/34/94/.273/.339/.513/2

31) Rafael Devers - BOS, 3B, 28.5 - Devers is consistently one of easiest evaluations in the game. He consistently smashes the ball with elite EV and a swing that is geared for both power and average. You can bank on about .270+/30+ every single year. Just call him Dollar Bill Devers, because you can take him to the bank. But there is one thing sticking in my craw this year, which is that he battled shoulder issues in both shoulders this season. His season ended in late September with shoulder inflammation. There was no structural damage and he won't require surgery, but shoulders are damn important for hitting, and it's a concern that this shoulder "inflammation" can keep popping up down the line. He's going to be 28 next year, which is still smack dab in his prime, but he is starting to creep up there a bit. I'm not dinging him too much for it, but it's why he's ranked here and not 10 spots higher. - 2025 Projection: 90/31/98/.274/.354/.510/3

32) Logan Gilbert - SEA, RHP, 27.9 - While everyone was focused on George Kirby, waiting for Kirby to turn into a true ace, Gilbert was putting in the work in the shadows, and he emerged as the one to enter true ace territory in 2024. He put up a 3.23 ERA with a 27.4/4.6 K%/BB% in 208.2 IP. He led all of baseball in IP. His 31.7% whiff% is in elite territory for a starter, and his walk rate was in the top 5% of baseball. Elite control, swing and miss, and durability is a Teflon combination. And that isn't even it. He throws gas with a 96.6 MPH fastball. His splitter is insanely elite with a 50.6% whiff% and .137 xwOBA. His most used pitch is a plus to double plus slider with a 36.8% whiff% and .264 xwOBA. And he has yet another plus secondary in his curve with a 35.4% whiff% and .210 xwOBA. He also throws a useful cutter, giving him a very diverse pitch mix. He straight up doesn't have a flaw. He has a very very real case to be the top fantasy pitcher and the game, and also possibly the top dynasty pitcher in the game. - 2025 Projection: 15/3.18/0.98/209 in 200 IP

33) Roki Sasaki - LAD, RHP, 23.5 - Sasaki and his people pulled whatever back room deals that needed to be pulled and got him coming stateside this season, which is insanely exciting, because there is little doubt that he will be a true ace right from the get go, and possibly the best pitcher in all the land. He's better than Yamamoto, and you saw Yamamoto's seamless transition, other than the shoulder injury. But that injury might have pushed LA to a six man rotation, which works just fine for Sasaki. His fastball sits in the upper 90's and regularly hits over 100 MPH. The splitter is truly elite and the slider is plus. He has prototypical size at a projectable and athletic 6'2'', 187 pounds, and he has plus control/command of his stuff. He's been so insanely dominant in Japan that he has basically already hit legend status with so many crazy feats, and he's only 23 years old. He put up a 2.35 ERA with a 28.7/7.1 K%/BB% in 111 IP this year. He was even better in 2023 with a 1.78 ERA and 39.1%/4.9% K%/BB% in 91 IP. As you can see, the biggest and only red flag is injuries, as he has a career high of 129.1 IP. He battled an oblique injury in 2023 and right arm discomfort in 2024. The right arm discomfort is particularly concerning because his stuff was actually down a tick or two this year. It was still beastly, but would any of us be surprised if Tommy John/internal brace surgery was right around the corner? You can't be too scared off by that, because even if he needs it, he should still return as an ace. He's so easily the top pick in my Top 146 2025 First Year Player Draft Rankings (Patreon), and while I don't think he's a no brainer for #1 overall prospect in the game, how can you not put a ready made ace in the top spot, injury risk be damned. He's my top dog in the Top 500 2025 Prospects Rankings (Patreon). - 2025 Projection: 12/3.06/1.04/175 in 150 IP Prime Projection: 16/2.72/0.92/240 in 185 IP

34) Corbin Burnes - ARI, RHP, 30.5 - When it comes to proven veteran studs, I think you can get into more trouble than it's worth to slice and dice the numbers too much. Burnes just completed his 5th straight season of legit ace production with a 2.92 ERA and 23.1/6.1 K%/BB% in 194.1 IP. His K rates are in steep decline, falling from the 36.7% and 35.6% marks he put up in 2020 and 2021, but this is the part where I don't want to over evaluate a proven year after year elite ace. His 28.6% whiff% is still well above average, so I would be surprised if the K rates didn't bounce back somewhat in 2025, and his 3 secondaries (curve, slider, change) are all whiff machines, so he could rack up more strikeouts if he wanted to. He was content to dominate with plus control of the 2nd best cutter in baseball with a +20 run value (only Emmanuel Clase topped that with a 23 Run Value). No matter how you slice it ... or dice it ... Burnes is a true ace, just don't expect the days of mid 30% K rates anymore, obviously. - 2025 Projection: 15/3.13/1.05/205 in 194 IP

35) Luis Robert - CHW, OF, 27.8 - Robert is in super juicy buy low territory right now. This one feels like it's served up on a silver platter. He had a down year in 2024 with a career worst 33.2% K% and .224 BA, but he has a 1,944 career PA track record with a 27% K% and .267 BA. He's smack dab in the middle of his prime at 27 years old, and he has near elite bat speed with a 74.5 MPH swing. His 28.8 ft/sec sprint speed was a 4 year high, and he hit the ball very hard with a 90.1 MPH EV. There is no physical decline, and there is a huge track record which says this was simply a down year. And even in a down year he hit 14 homers with 23 steals in 100 games (about a 21/35 pace). It's as easy as could be to buy the bounce back in 2025, but the one real area of concern is injuries. He once again missed a large chunk of the season with a hip injury. He's played in over 100 games just once in his career (2023), and even that year his season ended with a sprained MCL which would have kept him out for a couple months had it not been the end of the season. The White Sox are also terrible, which can't help the motivation, let alone Runs and RBI. Those reasons are why he can't really be in elite or near elite asset territory, but there is easy 30/30 upside in here if he does stay healthy, and that is worth trying to acquire on a discount this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 82/23/72/.254/.312/.470/28

36) Riley Greene - DET, OF, 24.6 - With how volatile development can be, it's always nice when a talented prospect has a nice and smooth upward trajectory. Greene put up a 98 wRC+ in 2022, a 121 wRC+ in 2023 and finally a 135 wRC+ in 2024. He raised his launch (12.2 degrees), improved his whiff% (26.8%) and improved his Chase% (23.1%). That is all he needed to explode with how hard he hit the ball already (13.4% Barrel% with a 91.3 MPH EV) and how fast he swung the bat (elite 74.5 MPH swing). He slashed .262/.348/.479 with 24 homers, 4 steals, and a 26.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 137 games. Even if this is where he tops out, that would be a very good player, but I think he has at least one more level in him. I would be surprised if he can't get that strikeout rate down into the low 20's at true peak, resulting in several seasons of plus to double plus hit/power production.. - 2025 Projection: 86/28/92/.276/.359/.498/7

37) Yoshinobu Yamamoto - LAD, RHP, 26.8 - The only blemish on Yamamoto's excellent first season stateside was a shoulder injury that knocked him out for almost 3 months, limiting him to just 90 IP. It might have been the straw that broke the camels back to push the Dodgers over the edge to go to a 6 man rotation in 2025. Or maybe it's that Ohtani is coming back from his 2nd major elbow injury. Or that Glasnow can only throw 130 IP during a season. Or that Gavin Stone will likely miss all of 2025 with a shoulder injury. Or that Buehler took all season to start looking like himself coming off his 2nd Tommy John. Or that Bobby Miller was a shell of his former self. Or that River Ryan underwent Tommy John that will keep him out for all of 2025. Or that ... I can honestly keep going on and on. Roki Sasaki is likely to get added to the mix too, and he's had his own injury problems which is another reason to go 6 man. Point being, we might have to put a cap on how many innings all Dodgers starters will be able to pitch, but if it keeps them healthy, who wouldn't be for that. And a healthy Yamamoto was a true ace with a 3.00 ERA and 28.5/6.5 K%/BB% in 90 IP. The fastball sat 95.5 MPH and while it wasn't a dominant pitch, it was firmly above average. The famed splitter lived up to the billing with a 38.6% whiff% and .227 xwOBA. And the curveball was plus too with a 33% whiff% and .252 xwOBA. He also mixes in a cutter, slider and sinker every now and then. And he has plus control over that impressive arsenal. He fully lived up to the hype, shoulder injury notwithstanding. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.17/1.12/195 in 170 IP

38) Corey Seager - TEX, SS, 30.11 - Seager underwent hernia surgery in late January 2024, which was supposed to keep him out for a portion of 2024, but he ended up being ready on opening day, which might have been a mistake, because his season then ended on September 2nd after undergoing hernia surgery again. He was also battling some hip trouble at the end of the season. I'm no doctor, but maybe giving his first hernia surgery more than 2 months to heal before returning to real games would have been prudent. At least on this 2nd hernia surgery he will have no choice with all off-season to heal. And sandwiched between the two surgeries was Seager having yet another tremendous season. He jacked 30 homers with a 140 wRC+ and 18.0/9.9 K%/BB% in 123 games. The underlying numbers back up him being one of the best hitters in the game with a .394 xwOBA which was the 10th best mark in baseball. He's starting to get up there in age, and the injuries are starting to pile up a bit, but with zero signs of slowing down so far, I don't want to get too concerned. He should continue to be one of the best hitters in baseball for the next few seasons, and he's also a candidate to be a major producer deep into his 30's. - 2025 Projection: 88/33/97/.288/.362/.528/2

39) Matt Olson - ATL, 1B, 31.0 - What goes up, must come down. After putting up a career year in 2023 with 54 homers, Olson nearly bottomed out with the 2nd worst year of his career in 2024 with a 117 wRC+. While I didn't see him falling that far, I saw the fall coming, writing in his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "2023 strikes me as a career year, but Olson is one of the premier power hitters in baseball." And now I can follow up that blurb with "2024 strikes me as a down year, and Olson is still one of the premier power hitters in baseball." He dominated to close out the season with 16 homers and .949 OPS in his final 63 games. He still hit the ball very hard with a 12.4% Barrel% that was right in line with career norms. It was just a down year. He remains one of the best power hitters in the game. - 2025 Projection: 93/36/115/.253/.348/.517/1

40) Pete Alonso - NYM, 1B, 30.4 - Alonso's BA unsurprisingly bounced back from a .205 BABIP induced .217 BA in 2023, rising to .240 with a .276 BABIP in 2024, which is right around his career norms. The ebbs and flows of a baseball career are always interesting, with luck being such a big part of the game. Make sure to keep that in mind when evaluating Alonso's career low 34 homers this year too. His 14.4 degree launch was 3.8 degrees lower than last year, so there might have been a conscious attempt to balance out his profile, but 34 homers is a really nice floor to have. And that is basically a reasonable floor with a 95.3 MPH FB/LD EV and a 75.3 MPH swing that is the 16th fastest swing in baseball amongst qualified hitters. Seeing how fast he swings the bat gives added confidence that his skills are not going to tank in his 30's. This is a special talent who should be ripping dingers deep into his mid 30's. - 2025 Projection: 92/37/115/.248/.339/.507/3

41) Michael Harris - ATL, OF, 24.1 - It's an absolutely no brainer to stay (almost) fully in on Harris. I say almost because his stolen bases and speed dropped off considerably in 2024 with 10 steals and a 28.3 ft/sec sprint in 110 games. He had a 29.4 ft/sec sprint in 2022. Some of it could be blamed on a hamstring injury that knocked him out for 2 months, but not all of it could be blamed on that. It seems like the reasonable hope is for him to get to around 20+ rather than 30+, which is still very valuable. And steals can be extremely hard to predict because it often is just a choice of how much a player wants to run, so I wouldn't rule anything out. His plate approach also hasn't improved at all in his 3 years in the bigs with a 39.6% Chase%, and finally he hasn't improved his launch at all with a 7.5 degree launch. Honestly after writing that all out, even I'm questioning if maybe I shouldn't still be all the way in, but when I look at his elite 74.7 MPH swing, 10% Barrel%, 90.5/95.3 MPH AVG/FB EV, 47% Hard Hit%, and 20% K%, I realize there is no way I'm betting against this guy. That just screams electric player, and keep in mind all of those above stats were accumulated in his age 21-23 year old seasons. I don't think we've seen his prime yet, and just a few incremental improvements in a few area could result in absolutely beastly seasons. His development hasn't gone exactly like planned, which is why I wouldn't consider him in that Top 20 ish dynasty asset area, but he's easily still a Top 50 guy. - 2025 Projection: 88/23/77/.282/.328/.467/23

42) Lawrence Butler - OAK, OF, 24.9 - Butler put all of his faithful followers loyalty to the test when he got sent down to the minors after putting up a .555 OPS in his first 41 games of the season. He pulled the dynasty baseball version of "if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best." I'm not gonna lie, after naming him a target this off-season, I did drop him in one league after he got sent back down, but I never let him leave my mind, and when he got called back up and hit a dinger or two, I spent large amounts of FAAB because I simply couldn't bear to watch him breakout on someone else's team, and that proved prudent as he was a beast the rest of the way. He slashed .291/.330/.565 with 20 homers, a perfect 15 for 15 on the bases, and a 21.8/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 84 games. The reason I was so quick to stick my neck out to pick him back up (and shouldn't have dropped him in the first place) is that the underlying numbers were screaming that he was getting unlucky earlier in the season, and the underlying numbers don't lie (well, sometimes they lie, but not in this case). He smashes the ball with an 11% Barrel% and 91.1 MPH EV, he's an excellent athlete, and his hit tool has continually improved throughout his career, with the improvements sticking in the majors with a respectable 26.8% whiff% and 27.3% chase%. And to top it all off, he's about to get a major ballpark upgrade in 2025 and beyond. He had a .866 OPS on the road vs. a .753 OPS at home this year. I've been super high on him, and I'll continue to be super high on him. Even this ranking might be too low. - 2025 Projection: 84/28/82/.255/.326/.487/20

43) Zach Neto - LAA, SS, 24.2 - I was Zach Neto's biggest fan, ranking him 3rd overall in his FYPD class, far above consensus, and even I couldn't foresee him stealing 30 bags this year. He stole only 5 bags in 84 games in 2023, and his 27.7 ft/sec sprint wasn't that impressive. He actually got faster in 2024 with a 28.2 ft/sec sprint, which shows he made it a point to improve in that area last off-season, and he just decided to run more with 40 steal attempts. He wasn't particularly successful, so it just goes to show how hard it is to predict steals. It can simply come down to how much a player chooses to run. Considering he wasn't all that successful though, I think we have to consider what he did in 2024 a ceiling. Even if that drops down to 20, he has enough power and feel to hit to be a perennial 20/20 player with a solid BA. His 23 homers, 88.5/94.2 MPH FB/LD EV, 12.3 degree launch and 23.3% K% shows a player that can hit for both power and average. He's still young and was thrown into the fire with the Angels aggressively promoting players, so I wouldn't be surprised to see an uptick in both contact and power. His 6.5% BB% is low, but I see that definitely rising as he gains more experience. All of that above analysis assumes he will be healthy for 2025, and that now isn't a guarantee with him undergoing shoulder surgery in early November which puts his rehab timeline right up against Opening Day. Even if he is ready in time, major surgery like that that takes all off-season to rehab is not a recipe for a big season. I'm bummed about it, but long term, I'm not going to let it shake me too much.- 2025 Projection: 74/21/78/.257/.324/.441/18 (assuming he misses some time in 2025) Prime Projection: 90/25/90/.271/.335/.465/25

44) Dylan Crews - WAS, OF, 23.1 - Crews' dynasty value/hype has seen some fluctuations since being drafted, but the thing that was quietly flying under the radar, was how good he was on the bases, and for fantasy, that has a major impact on his value. He stole 25 bases in 100 games in the upper minors, and then he stole 12 bags with a double plus 29.3 ft/sec sprint in his 31 game MLB debut. He only stole 6 bases in 71 games his junior year of college, and then went 3 for 7 in his pro debut, so I can't blame anyone for not expecting it, but it's clearly a real skill he has, and it makes Crews insanely exciting for fantasy again. He combines the speed with above average contact rates (19.7% K%), above average chase rates (26.6%), and plus power (94.7 MPH FB/LD EV in the majors and a 90.2 MPH EV in the minors). The only quibble in his profile is the low launch (8.8 degrees), but he has the skillset to make that work, and he only needs to raise it a bit higher to be in a completely fine range, which I'm betting he will. The Langford vs. Crews debate might not end up as easy as we thought, and with Crews not really being considered in that lofty tier anymore, there could be a buy window here this off-season. If you can buy off the relatively subdued hype and .641 MLB OPS, I would be all over it. He's a Top 50 dynasty asset in my book. - 2025 Projection: 81/21/76/.259/.334/.448/26 Prime Projection: 94/27/97/.278/.359/.481/28

45) Jasson Dominguez - NYY, OF, 22.2 - The Yankees didn't want to unleash Dominguez in the majors this year, and his .617 OPS in the 67 PA he did receive isn't super impressive, but make no mistake, Dominguez is still on the superstar path. His 75.4 MPH swing is straight elite, which proves right there that his talent really wasn't that overhyped as an international prospect. His 23.4% whiff% was comfortably above average, which is pretty huge to see, and his 28.1% Chase% was slightly above average. Tack on plus speed, and Dominguez' beastly potential was even able to shine through despite the Yanks refusing to unleash him. And oh yea, he destroyed the upper minors immediately after returning from Tommy John surgery in mid May with a 135 wRC+, 11 homers, 16 steals (in 17 attempts) and a 20.0/8.8 K%/BB% in 58 games. Is he really 22 years old and not 26 years old? Beats me. But I don't care when it comes to a talent this huge (I gave my thoughts on MLB cracking down on players' lying about their ages in the 19 Dynasty Baseball Strategies/Thoughts for 2025). I see no reason why the Yanks won't unleash him immediately in 2025, and he could be on a beeline for elite dynasty asset status in short order. Go after him. - 2025 Projection: 83/21/76/.246/.323/.434/26 Prime Projection: 109/28/91/.266/.351/.487/34

46) Junior Caminero - TBR, 3B, 21.9 - Caminero swings the 9th fastest bat in baseball at 77.2 MPH. He hits the ball very, very hard with a 93.3 MPH EV at Triple-A, and a 89.7 MPH EV, 11.8% Barrel%, and a 45.7% Hard Hit% in the majors. And the best part of all is that he's had above average strikeout rates most of his career, putting up a very respectable 21.5% K% in 43 MLB games. There is almost no way this guy isn't going to start raking his face off in the very near future. The swing is a little on the long side, the 31.7% whiff% doesn't look as good as the K rates, he chases a lot with a 35.4 Chase%, and the launch is low at 6.8 degrees, but he legitimately has the type of profile that can make all of those things work and still put up big numbers. And at only 21 years old, his plate skills and launch are only going to improve. He's right on track to be one of the best hit/power combo bats in the game, and if there is any buy window based on the small, mediocre MLB sample, I would be all over it. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/83/.262/.319/.461/5 Prime Projection: 89/33/103/.279/.343/.516/7

47) Jackson Holliday - BAL, 2B, 21.4 - There always has to be one. Chourio was a beast. Langford was really good and beasted at the end of the season. Merrill exceeded all expectations all year. Caminero showed flashes and laid a solid foundation. And then there was Holliday, who had a nightmare rookie year. He slashed .189/.255/.311 with 5 homers, 4 steals, and a 33.2/7.2 K%/BB% in 60 games. The .262 xwOBA backs up the terrible surface stats. To continue with the bad, just to get it all out of my system, his bat speed also wasn't very impressive with a 71.2 MPH swing that was very slightly below average. There are very real things to be concerned about, like the hit tool being bottom of the scale bad, because he doesn't necessarily have the biggest game power/base stealing to truly make up for that. It's possible for prospects to bust, or have decent but unspectacular careers, even elite ones who feel can't miss. Now having said that, I'm not even close to giving up on Holliday. Even with the extreme struggles, he put up a very good 8.2% Barrel% and 89.3/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV. Hitting the ball that hard as a 20 year old is impressive. He's also lightning fast with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint, and he had an above average 27.2% Chase%, so it's not like he was completely lost up there. His hit tool has been very strong at every stop of the minors, so a 33.9% whiff% as a 20 year old in his first taste of the majors really isn't that huge of a deal. It's almost certain to improve as he gains experience. Do I think his terrible season has his stock dropping a bit? Yes. But he's still a Top 50 dynasty asset for me, and I'm expecting a much better year 2. - 2025 Projection: 77/16/68/.247/.318/.411/18 Prime Projection: 98/25/83/.278/.360/.485/25

48) Cole Ragans - KCR, LHP, 27.4 - Ragans proved without a shadow of a doubt that his 2nd half 2023 breakout was 100% legit. He was a legit ace for the entire season in 2024, and most importantly, he stayed healthy all year. He put up a 3.14 ERA with a 29.3/8.8 K%/BB% in 186.1 IP. The 32% whiff% was elite and the control was average, which is all he needs to let his explosive stuff do the rest. His 95.4 MPH fastball was the 8th most valuable fastball in baseball with a +16 Run Value. His double plus changeup was the 15th most valuable changeup in the game, putting up a 47.8% whiff%. The slider and curve were both plus, bat missing weapons, and he throws a useful cutter too. The only deficiency is that his control was merely average and not plus, which puts him slightly below the aces ranked ahead of him, but not by much. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.28/1.13/218 in 185 IP

49) Hunter Greene - CIN, RHP, 25.8 - Here is what I wrote in part in Greene's 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "Buy low on Hunter Greene. We’ve been taught over and over again to not throw the towel in on elite pitching prospects if they don’t immediately dominate their first few years in the league, and Greene has all of the ingredients to be a next level breakout as he gains more experience. I know the fastball gets hit harder than you would expect, but as his command improves and as he continues to tinker with his arsenal, I’m betting on him figuring it out. This is going to be one of those breakouts that look so obvious in hindsight." ... and that obvious (in hindsight) breakout happened in 2024 with him putting up a 2.75 ERA (4.82 ERA in 2023), 3.03 xERA, and a 27.7/9.3 K%/BB% in 150.1 IP. He did in fact tinker with his arsenal (I wrote that blurb before news of his new pitches came out, but of course all young pitchers are now tinkering with their arsenals if they are smart), improving his fastball movement to the point where it was the 2nd most valuable fastball in baseball (Cade Smith is #1 by a landslide). He also added a splitter which was an above average pitch, even if he didn't go to it often (8.3% usage). And the slider of course remained a plus to double plus whiff machine (39% whiff%). His control/command remained below average, but I still think there is another level in here as he stays healthy and gains more experience. I don't even think this is the peak, assuming he stays healthy, which who knows there honestly (he missed time with elbow inflammation this year). Greene had the ace breakout I knew was coming, and I'm going to continue to buy high. - 2025 Projection: 14/3.26/1.05/203 in 170 IP

50) Zack Wheeler - PHI, RHP, 34.10 - Not only did Wheeler show zero signs of slowing down, it was arguably his best season ever with a 2.57 ERA, 0.96 WHIP and 28.5/6.6 K%/BB% in 200 IP. The ERA and WHIP were career bests, and the K rate was the 2nd best mark of his career. He added a splitter this year which was immediately an elite pitch with a 40.2% whiff% and .178 xwOBA (7.3% usage). That was just the cherry on top of an already elite 5 pitch mix (now 6 pitch mix). As much as I love fading the true aces, there is no doubt that having a consistent veteran ace like this on a win now team is invaluable. In win now, I wouldn't worry about his age too much and just ride him. And if you are about to start a rebuild, make sure you get an absolute haul for him despite his age. A general dynasty ranking will be hard to capture his true dynasty value in practice, rather than just in theory. He's a league changer. - 2025 Projection: 15/2.93/1.04/211 in 195 IP

51) Freddie Freeman - LAD, 1B, 35.7 - The decline has to come one day, right? And as we saw with Paul Goldschmidt, when it comes for a player around this age, their dynasty value falls off a cliff very quickly. If I owned Freeman, even in win now mode, I would be mighty tempted to cash my chips in this off-season, even if the offer isn't like a godfather type offer. He had another excellent year in 2024 with a 137 wRC+, 22 homers, 9 steals, and a 15.7/12.2 K%/BB% in 147 games. His .370 xwOBA was a career low, but it was still in the top 6% of baseball, which just shows how great of a career he's having. He should have a gentle decline, but even a gentle decline will tank his trade value. It's better to sell a year early than a year late. I think this is the year to pull the trigger. - 2025 Projection: 92/25/102/.290/.384/.501/10

52) Ketel Marte - ARI, 2B, 31.6 - Marte has always hit the ball hard, but he went absolutely bonkos in 2024 with a 94 MPH EV which was a career high by a mile (91.1 MPH in 2023). It was the 6th best EV in baseball amongst qualified hitters. And it resulted in him smashing 36 homers in 136 games to go along with his usual excellent plate plate approach (18.2/11.1 K%/BB%) and high BA (.292). His righty swing is just an insane 77.2 MPH, and it resulted in a 1.080 OPS vs. lefties. His 71.5 MPH lefty swing is just fine too and it resulted in a .841 OPS. I have to say, the jump in EV is suspiciously high, but what do I know. It sure feels like a career year, but if the throwback steroid era 30 year old power breakout is for real, maybe he can hold this level for the next couple years. I find it hard to bet on that, but even if he falls back to career norms, he's still a damn good hitter. - 2025 Projection: 97/29/90/.280/.357/.506/8

53) Michael King - SDP, RHP, 29.10 - King is a true ace. It really is that simple. After his rough April, he put up a 2.42 ERA with a 28.5/7.4 K%/BB% in 137.2 IP. He stayed healthy all year and accumulated 185.2 IP including the playoffs, and he was getting stronger as the year went on. His changeup was the 4th most valuable change in baseball with a +10 run value and notching a 36.2% whiff%. His 92.9 MPH sinker was the 22nd most valuable sinker in baseball. The 93.7 MPH 4-seamer missed bats with a 26.1% whiff%, and the sweeper gave him another swing and miss secondary with a 34.5% whiff%. His 29.2% whiff% overall is near elite. He was not a fluke at all, as he flashed these same skills at the end of 2023. I wouldn't quite place him at the top of the "true ace" tier, as even during his dominate May-September the 3.40 SIERA wasn't quite as good as the ERA, and the K/BB numbers weren't in the land of Skenes, Crochet, Skubal, and Sale, but he's in the tier right under them. - 2025 Projection: 14/3.28/1.16/205 in 175 IP

54) George Kirby - SEA, RHP, 27.2 - Kirby still hasn't found that great secondary, and it resulted in him continuing to sit in that low end ace territory with a 3.53 ERA and 23.0/3.0 K%/BB% in 191 IP. His 96 MPH fastball is elite with a 29.1% whiff%, and his 3% BB% is best in all of baseball amongst qualified pitchers. And while he hasn't had a secondary pitch breakout, he throws 3 secondaries (slider, splitter, curve) which are all average to above average. His slider was actually the 13th most valuable slider in baseball with a 9 Run Value, but the pitch got lucky with a .294 xwOBA and 27.1% whiff% vs. a .245 wOBA. This is his 2nd straight year of 190+ IP, and even if he doesn't rack up strikeouts, I would still put him in low ace territory. His secondaries did improve in 2024, so if he can improve them again in 2025, that could be the incremental improvement he needs to really put up some monstrous career years. I'm definitely not budging off Kirby. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.28/1.02/154 in 160 IP Update: Shoulder inflammation will put him on the IL to start the season, but it doesn't seem overly serious, so don't want to jump tank his value. He does drop a bit though

55) Dylan Cease - SDP, RHP, 29.2 - Cease is officially one of the most inconsistent pitchers in baseball,, and I guess below average control will do that to you, but he put up a career best 8.5% BB% in 2024, which is almost dead average, giving hope that he can get off that seesaw and just remain a consistent ace from here on out. We all know the stuff is straight filth with the 2nd most valuable slider in baseball (behind only Chris Sale and tied with Ronel Blanco) that notched a 44.6% whiff% and .211 xwOBA. The 4-seamer sits 96.9 MPH, and he rounds out the arsenal with a much lesser used knuckle curve and sweeper. The sweeper is a new pitch and it was excellent when he went to it with a 38.5% whiff% on only 4.2% usage. It all led to a 3.47 ERA (3.32 xERA) with a 29.4/8.5 K%/BB% in 189.1 IP. His 32.3% whiff% is elite. His control started to regress more towards career norms in the 2nd half with a 9.6% BB% in his final 91 IP, so I'm not sure I completely trust the control gains. It's enough to keep him out of the true top tier ace range for me, but it's not enough to scare me off completely. He's in the 2nd tier of aces. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.53/1.18/220 in 185 IP

56) Spencer Strider - ATL, RHP, 26.6 - Strider underwent an internal brace procedure on his right elbow in mid April, and the best case scenario seems to be a late April return. Atlanta has World Series aspirations, so I'm sure their main goal is to have him healthy for the post-season. I've been preaching to take the "Tommy John" discount on elite starters for as long as I've been writing, but I do believe you have to factor in some level of risk. It's not like everyone just comes right back into prime form. Some never get fully healthy again. Most have to shake off some kind of rust at the least. What we do know for sure, is that Strider has best fantasy starter in the game potential if he's fully healthy. His slider is among the best, or the best in baseball with a 55.3% whiff% in 2023, which is nuts. The fastball sits mid to upper 90's and is a plus pitch. And he also throws a changeup and curve which are both really good pitches when he goes to them, which isn't often. And he has about average control of his arsenal. If you want to assume full health, he would rank somewhere in the 30's, but he's not going to pitch a full season this year, and assuming 100% full health right off the bat isn't something I would plan on. If he does immediately get back there, consider it gravy, but I think it's prudent to factor in some level of rust. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.40/1.15/166 in 135 IP

57) Blake Snell - LAD, LHP, 32.5 - Snell has always been an extremely streaky pitcher who needs to find a rhythm to succeed, so it was not surprising to see him struggle early in the season after Boras took his free agency negotiations into mid to late March. Snell doesn't blame Boras for not getting what he wanted this off-season though, coming to Boras' defense when Jordan Montgomery fired Boras, saying Boras "butchered" his free agency negotiations. Montgomery never found that rhythm all season, but Snell eventually did, putting up a 1.23 ERA with a 38.1/10.0 K%/BB% in his final 80.1 IP. The 95.9 MPH fastball performed better than ever with a 24.4% whiff% and .286 xwOBA. His 3 secondaries (curve, change, slider) put up a 49.8%, 47.6%, and 44.6% whiff%, respectively. It's his 2nd straight year of putting up a 37%+ whiff% overall, which is insane for a starting pitcher. Below average control, being 32 years old, and not being the type to rack up innings (he's thrown more than 129.1 IP just twice in his career) are the only things preventing him from ranking even higher. - 2025 Projection: 14/3.25/1.14/226 in 170 IP

58) Ozzie Albies - ATL, 2B, 28.3 - I'm a little torn on Albies. On the one hand, Albies is still in the prime of his career, and has a long track of excellent production, which makes predicting a bounce back season in 2025 seem very easy. But on the other hand, his 27.2 ft/sec sprint speed was a career low and was below average, he swings a well below average bat with a 69.1 MPH swing, and he chases a lot with a 33.6% Chase%. He also doesn't hit the ball hard enough (32% Hard Hit% in 2024 and 35.5% in his career) to make up for a lot of those deficiencies. He thrives based on the contact (14.9% K%), lift (18.4 degree launch), and pull (48.8% Pull%) profile, but I'm starting to question if this is a profile I want to bet on long term. The profile isn't that much different than Jose Altuve, who has aged just fine, so maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm starting to think that Albies might have more name value than real dynasty value at the moment. I'm not too concerned over the next couple of seasons, but in the medium and long term, I wouldn't be surprised to see him as just a good fantasy player, rather than a true difference maker. - 2025 Projection: 83/25/87/.266/.321/.461/16

59) Brenton Doyle - COL, OF, 26.11 - Doyle lowered his strikeout rate from 35% in 2023 to 25.4% in 2024, which has to be one of the biggest improvements of strikeout rate in a single year of all time. That is really unbelievable considering his strikeout rates were over 30% his entire minor league career too other than in rookie ball. If this were a case where the K rate was back over 30% in the 2nd half, I would be less likely to believe, but he put up a 26.1% K% post all break in 57 games, and a 20.8% K% in 19 games in September. It's prudent to factor in some regression, but it's pretty clear he took a big step forward with his hit tool, and that is all he needed to let his big power/speed combo shine. He hit 23 homers with 30 steals, and the underlying numbers back it up with a 10.5% Barrel% and 29.3 ft/sec sprint. If he didn't have such a terrible history of hit tool issues, he would likely rank even higher than this, so even this high ranking takes into account some added risk there. I'm 100% buying into Doyle. - 2025 Projection: 86/26/82/.248/.315/.447/29

60) Manny Machado - SDP, 3B, 32.9 - Machado underwent elbow surgery in early October 2023 which brought his rehab timeline right up against the start of 2024, and it seems pretty clear that was the reason for his slow start (.611 OPS in his first 42 games). But he quickly shook the rust off, and he looked healthy the rest of the way, slashing .297/.345/.525 with 24 homers, 9 steals, and a 17.7/6.9 K%/BB% in his final 110 games. He smashed the ball all season with a 92.5 MPH EV, so some of those early season struggles might have also just been bad luck. Everything was within career norms with zero signs og decline. He's creeping up there in age, but he's still a very impactful win now piece. His value might be in a very reasonably priced range this off-season for a win now team. - 2025 Projection: 82/30/97/.277/.334/.480/9

61) Kyle Schwarber - PHI, OF, 32.1 - Schwarber brought his BA back from the abyss in 2024 after getting too launch happy in 2022-23. His 19+ degree launches in those years were career highs, and they resulted in a .218 BA and .197 BA. He brought the launch back down to a reasonable 15 degrees this year, and the BA rose with it to .248. Even in 2022-23 the xBA was telling us that wasn't his true talent level. A career .230 BA in 4,660 PA just might be a large enough sample to say that is a fair expectation going forward ;). And of course what you are buying is that monster power. He couldn't get to 40+ like he did in the launch happy years, cracking 38 this year with a 93.6 MPH EV, but we will take that trade off all day. He's also an OBP machine with a .366 OBP. Schwarber is a great example on how league rules can drastically change a players value. Even in 5x5 BA leagues, he's great, but in an OBP league, or in a 6+ category league, or in an Ottoneu style points league (no negative for K's), he's a next level beast. He played in only 5 games in the OF last year, making him a DH only player right now, which is extremely annoying, and while he could gain OF eligibility during the season, there is no guarantee of that. It definitely dings his value, and it's something you are going to have to plan around now. - 2025 Projection: 104/39/100/.230/.343/.490/4

62) Brent Rooker - OAK, OF, 30.5 - I remember when Rooker was a fun FYPD "sleeper" pick back in 2017/18 after he destroyed pro ball in his pro debut with 18 homers in 62 games in the lower minors that same year he got drafted (just another reminder to not underrate great pro debuts). He then went on to rip dingers every year since, culminating in this monster career year in 2024. I guess what I'm saying is, maybe this monster year shouldn't have been as surprising at it seemed. He crushed 39 homers with a 164 wRC+ in 145 games, and the .383 xwOBA, which was top 4% in baseball, backed up the surface stats. It wasn't only the homers though, he also hit .293 and stole 11 bags. The reason why I called it a "career year," is that for one, it just smells of a career year the same way Matt Olson's 2023 smelled of a career year to me, and for two, the underlying numbers don't back up the hit tool. He had a 28.8% K% with a 34.1% whiff%, which tells me the BA is definitely coming way down in 2025. Regardless, there is zero doubt that Rooker is a legit elite power hitter with a 96.9 MPH FB/LD EV and 18.9 degree launch, so even if the BA comes way down, there is plenty of value to be had, and like every other hitter in Oakland, the ballpark upgrade will only help him. - 2025 Projection: 78/33/93/.260/.334/.510/8

63) Matt McLain - CIN, 2B/SS, 25.8 - Don't forget about little Matty Mclain. He underwent shoulder surgery in late March and then suffered a late season rib injury which knocked out his entire regular season. But he returned in time for the AFL to prove his shoulder was healthy, and he's hitting well there with 4 homers and a .844 OPS in 12 games. It gives confidence that with a full normal off-season, he will be ready to build on his awesome 2023 MLB debut where he slashed .290/.357/.507 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in 89 games. He obliterated Triple-A too with a 184 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint and he has above average power with a 89.3 MPH EV and 13.8 degree launch. His plate approach wasn’t great with a 28.5%/7.7% K%/BB% in the majors, but his chase rate was above average at 25.4%, and his 28% whiff% shows he isn’t going to have any major contact issues. He also had a 20.6%/16.7% K%/BB% in the minors. And the cherry on top is that he is a good defensive player, so his glove will keep him on the field. Assuming full health, McLain is the real deal, but factoring in some rust and/or risk from the surgery wouldn't be crazy. Just don't factor in too much, because McLain can be a really exciting fantasy player. - 2025 Projection: 82/25/79/.269/.343/.468/22

64) Pete Crow-Armstrong - CHC, OF, 23.0 - Pete Crow Armstrong’s power has been underrated from the time he was drafted. He was my #1 target in his 2020/21 FYPD class after getting drafted a ridiculous 19th overall, writing in his FYPD blurb, “Armstrong stands out for his plus speed, plus defense, and strong track record of hitting. Power hasn’t been a big part of his game, but he has recently added muscle onto his projectable 6’1” frame, and a 99 MPH exit velocity mark at a 2019 Perfect Game event is damn good. Armstrong is my favorite target in first year player drafts relative to consensus.” I’ve basically named him a target every 3 months since then, even ranking him within my Top 100 overall this off-season at #99. And in 2024, especially the 2nd half of 2024, we started to see the first buds of a breakout that could absolutely explode in 2025. For starters, he put up a 88.9/94.0 MPH AVG/FB EV on the season, which shows that power potential I saw 4 years ago wasn't a mirage. And when it comes with a 17.2 degree launch, an elite 30.0 ft/sec sprint speed, and elite CF defense, you have the makings of an extremely exciting fantasy player. We saw that player in his final 65 games, slashing .267/.317/.457 with 9 homers, 11 steals, and a 21.8/6.9 K%/BB%. The reason why he isn't ranked even higher is because he still does have some deficiencies in his game. His 70.6 MPH swing is below average, his 41.4% Chase% is extreme, and his 29.9% whiff% is well below average. That isn't exactly my favorite trifecta of skills, but he's still so young, I foresee all of those numbers improving. And focusing on what he doesn't do well is silly when what he does do well is so insanely exciting. Put some respect on this man’s name. His name is Pete Crow Armstrong, not Pete Crow Armweak. - 2025 Projection: 82/18/71/.244/.312/.425/31 Prime Projection: 93/24/74/.259/.331/.446/44

65) Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.3 - Campbell possesses one of the most visually disgusting swings I have ever seen, and I mean that in the best way possible. It looks like he literally unhinges his shoulder to turn his body into a cannon, absolutely unfurling on the baseball. Here is what I wrote about a homer Campbell hit in early September in the in-season Dynasty Baseball Rundowns: "on his latest homer, I think he dislocated his shoulder with one of the most bad intentions swings I've seen."  Underscoring my visual evaluation of that explosive shoulder movement is that shortly after that homer he hit the IL with a lat strain, which is right under the shoulder blades. Campbell underwent a well documented swing change and bat speed training to unlock more power last off-season, which was obviously successful beyond anybody's wildest imagination, so let's just hope that it's not going to cause more injuries. That is the only small thing that is even rattling around in my brain as a negative, because the season he just had was nothing short or spectacular. He slashed .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers, 24 steals, and a 19.9/14.3 K%/BB% in 115 games spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He was just as dominant in the upper minors as he was at High-A with across the board domination. He hits it hard, he has a good feel to hit, he has a good approach, he has size (6'3'', 191 pounds), he has bat speed, he can lift it, and he has speed. You can be hesitant to fully buy in because it feels like he came out of nowhere, but he put up a 1.033 OPS in 45 games in the ACC in 2023, a .932 OPS in 58 games in 2022 in the Northwoods League, and then a .911 OPS in 22 games at mostly High-A in his pro debut, so it's not his fault that everyone underrated him. He always had a good feel to hit and good approach, and he always had the frame and athleticism to tack on more power, so I'm not going to hold it against him that he wasn't more hyped (4th round pick in 2023). He still didn't lift and pull the ball a ton with an under 40% Pull% and under 30% FB%, but he knew when to pick his spots (as you saw with that homer video above), and he has the type of profile that can thrive without an extreme lift and pull profile. I'm all in on Campbell. He's an elite prospect who is knocking on the door of the bigs. 2025 Projection: 58/13/51/.252/.324/.423/15 Prime Projection: 98/26/89/.277/.356/.478/26

66) Roman Anthony - BOS, OF, 20.11 - Because the rule of prospecting is that if you are even the smallest, tiniest, tiny bit lower on a prospect than other prospectors (most to all have Anthony over Campbell, while I have it the other way around), you must bash that prospect with an overly critical lens, let me start with the negatives here. For one, Anthony isn't the best base stealer with a career 38 steals in 52 attempts (he was 21 for 28 last year), so there is risk that he doesn't run as much in the majors as we hope. Secondly, he hits the ball on the ground a lot with an around 50% GB% in 2024, which could limit his homer upside. And lastly, there is some hit tool risk with a 23.5% K%. Now that we got that out of the way, let me just say that I obviously love Anthony, he's a legit 50/50 coin flip with Campbell, and he's a no doubt elite prospect. He started the season as a 19 year old in the upper minors and obliterated both Double-A and Triple-A, slashing .291/.396/.498 with 18 homers, 21 steals, and a 23.5/14.6 K%/BB% in 119 games. He crushes the ball, he has speed, he has size, he has elite age to level production, and he hit both lefties and righties well in 2024. He's as close to a Gunnar Henderson clone as there is, and if you wanted to put him even as the #1 prospect in baseball, I wouldn't argue with you. He's going to be a beast. 2025 Projection: 51/14/46/.251/.328/.422/9 Prime Projection: 92/31/98/.272/.363/.493/18

67) Bryce Miller - SEA, RHP, 26.8 - I definitely don't trust the 2.94 ERA in 180.1 IP when the 3.73 xERA and 24.3/6.4 K%/BB% don't back that up, but this might very well be a case where the underlying numbers end up regressing towards the surface stats, rather than the other way around. Miller's 95.2 MPH 4-seamer was one of the best in the game with a +14 Run Value, ranking 14th in all of baseball. His new splitter was the most valuable splitter in baseball with a +10 Run Value. It didn't miss a ton of bats with a 29% whiff%, so I don't fully trust that it is actually the best splitter in baseball, but that is insanely impressive for a new pitch. He also started throwing a knuckle curve in the 2nd half which was excellent with a 37.8% whiff% and .207 xwOBA. He has a sinker which keeps the ball on the ground, and he mixes in a sweeper, slider and cutter too. All signs actually point towards him exploding in 2025. He's in that funny spot where his ERA should make him overrated, but nobody is fully buying the ERA I don't think, and I think the underlying numbers are about to meet up with those surface stats. I'm all in on Miller. - 2025 Projection: 14/3.39/1.06/189 in 185 IP

68) Grayson Rodriguez - BAL, RHP, 25.3 - Grayson is an ace waiting to happen. He's not quite there yet, but as long as he stays healthy, it's basically a foregone conclusion, so if you can get any discount/fatigue price on him at all, I would jump on it. He leveled up in 2024 with a 3.86 ERA and 26.5/7.3 K%/BB% in 116.2 IP. The 96.1 MPH fastball notched a plus 26.9% K% and .325 xwOBA. The pitch got a bit unlucky, but it's a plus pitch. The plus changeup was his best and most used secondary with a 34.8% whiff% and .254 xwOBA. The slider wasn't that great, but it missed a lot of bats with a 36.1% whiff%, so I think it will be a good pitch long term. He also threw an average-ish curve. It all resulted in a 30% whiff%, which is elite for a starter, and the control was above average. Velocity, control, bat missing fastball, bat missing secondaries, diverse pitch mix, size  ... he has it all, and it was just starting to blossom last year until a lat injury (near the shoulder) ended his season on July 31st. It seemed he was healthy enough to be considered for the post-season, but Baltimore decided to play it safe. All pitchers are risky, so I'm inclined to use the injury as another chance to buy at a small discount. He won't come cheap and there might not be any discount on him at all, so maybe the real takeaway here is that if you own him already, don't be the one to sell even slightly low and then come to regret it. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.48/1.17/170 in 150 IP Update: Received a cortisone shot for elbow inflammation and will start the season on the IL. You can't panic, but this doesn't feel great

69) Chris Sale - ATL, LHP, 35.11 - Vintage Chris Sale came back for 2024, and really the only thing that changed was that he stayed healthy. His 177.2 IP was the most he's pitched in a season since 2017. And he performed like 2017 Chris Sale too with a 2.38 ERA and 32.1/5.6 K%/BB%. The slider was the best slider in baseball by a large margin with a 24 Run Value (Dylan Cease and Ronel Blanco were tied for 2nd at 19, and the next highest guy was Ryan Helsley at 13). The 94.8 MPH 4-seamer was above average to plus with a respectable 24.1% whiff%. His changeup was the best it's been in 6 years with a .244 xwOBA. He also throws a lesser used, decent sinker which keeps the ball on the ground. He's basically 36 years old and he hasn't thrown this many innings in years. Who knows if he can do it again, but what I do know is that I'm not betting against at least plus control of that kind of arsenal. You have to factor in some injury and age risk, but he looks like an elite win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 14/3.14/1.04/202 in 165 IP

70) Tyler Glasnow - LAD, RHP, 31.8 - After throwing a career high 120 IP in 2023, Glasnow topped that mark in 2024 with 134 IP. If we want to look on the bright side, he is headed in the right direction. If we want to look on the dark side, he has a very clear internal limit of about 145 IP max (he threw 144.2 IP in 2014 if you want to include the minors and the AFL), and the closer he gets to that mark, the more the countdown until injury gets closer to zero. His season ended on August 11th with an elbow injury. The good news is that it already might be fully healed, so he should be full go for 2025 theoretically. When he's on the mound, he's among the best fantasy starters in the game with a 3.49 ERA, 2.65 xERA, and a 32.2/6.7 K%/BB%. That K% was 4th highest among pitchers with more than 100 IP (Crochet, Snell, and Skenes were the top 3, in that order). The stuff is straight filthy with 3 plus to elite pitches in his 96.3 MPH 4-seamer, slider and curveball. Even with all of the injury risk, and the likely cap of about 150 IP (and that is being generous), Glasnow's upside is just too high to ding too much. I'm willing to take on the risk. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.33/1.03/178 in 140 IP

71) Shota Imanaga - CHC, LHP, 31.7 - It’s no secret that I enjoy a good victory lap like Wade Boggs on horseback taking a victory lap around Yankee Stadium after beating the Braves in the 1996 World Series. Like Boggs, I also eat chicken before I write every article, and I also drink 107 beers on a flight before going 2 for 3 with 2 doubles just hours later. Come to think of it, maybe that was CJ Abrams problem. Not that he partied until 8 am, but that he went 0 for 3 right after that. Dude, we all know that if you are going to be a rebel, you better produce. Maybe he did deserve that punishment after all ;). Now where was I? Oh yea, victory lapping. While I do believe in celebrating your hits, I also believe in taking the walk of shame for your misses, and finding lessons in who I consider to be my biggest miss, Shota Imanaga. I had Imanaga pegged as a good, but not great MLB pitcher, giving him a projection of 11/3.91/1.22/175 in 160 IP. He ended up going 15/2.91/1.02/174 in 173.1 IP. I believe where I went wrong was that I overrated fastball velocity, and while to my credit, the 91.7 MPH fastball actually didn’t miss that many bats (17.5% whiff%) or induce weak contact (91.2 MPH EV with .327 xwOBA), it was still a positive value pitch with a 52% usage rate, and it came with elite control, an elite secondary (splitter), a diverse pitch mix, and a history of ace production in the 2nd toughest league in the world. I shouldn’t have let a low 90’s fastball blind me to how good and established the rest of the profile was, and also to the fact that the fastball was still pretty good despite the low velocity. This wasn’t my only miss, but I believe that every other miss I had, my process was good and I don’t regret my take on them. Imanaga is the only one where I’m disappointed in my evaluation, and I will be taking those lessons with me headed into 2025, starting with properly ranking him for next season, which is in the near ace tier. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.28/1.06/182 in 175 IP

72) Framber Valdez - HOU, LHP, 31.5 - Valdez had a mediocre first half of the season, but he was back at ace levels in his final 108.2 IP with a 2.24 ERA and 27.5/8.4 K%/BB%. He's a groundball machine with 4 of his 5 pitches putting up a 2 degree through a negative 13 degree launch. His curve, slider and changeup are whiff machines with a 39.8%, 35.4%, and 38.3% whiff%. And he's maintained slightly above average control for 3 full seasons now. His K numbers have never been high enough to put into the true ace tier, but he's firmly established in the lower ace tier. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.25/1.13/190 in 190 IP

73) William Contreras - MIL, C, 27.3 - Contreras is coming off back to back seasons finishing as the #1 catcher in fantasy. He's smack dab in the middle of his prime at 27 years old. There isn't much an argument for anybody else to hold down the #1 dynasty catcher in the game spot. He smashes the ball with a career high 92.8 MPH EV that is in the top 6% of the league, and his 118.1 MPH Max EV was the 4th hardest hit ball all season. He has a good feel to hit and a plus plate approach (20.5/11.5 K%/BB%). And he also nabbed 9 bags this year, which is a really, really nice little bonus to get from your catcher. The only quibble with his profile is that he hits it on the ground a lot with a 54.5% GB%, which definitely limits his homer upside, but he hits the ball hard enough where he can still hit plenty of dingers, as evidenced by him knocking out 23 this year. - 2025 Projection: 88/22/84/.279/.360/.460/6

74) Triston Casas - BOS, 1B, 25.3 - Casas missed 4 months of the season after suffering torn cartilage in his ribs in late April. I've had two pretty big rib injuries in my life, once playing tackle football with my knucklehead friends when we were like 18 years old (no pads, just pickup tackle), and once playing flag football in my law school league. I guess maybe the lesson is that tackle football isn't anymore dangerous than flag football ;) ... but point being, when you hurt your ribs, any movement at all can be extremely painful. It's not surprising that he was rusty when he returned in mid August, but by the end of the season, he was starting to hit his stride with 5 homers and a 1.026 OPS in is final 12 games. The rib injury was a small bump in the road, but that was all it was as he's still on the path to being one of the top slugging 1B in baseball. He swings a double plus 74.6 MPH bat, which is really all you need to know about how legit his power is. His 90.2/95.8 MPH AVG/FB EV also backs up how elite his power is, and he's never had any launch issues in his career, so there are zero worries there either. The only worry is that the hit tool ends up below average with a 32.2% whiff%, but it was better in 2023 (28.1% whiff%), and even with a below average hit tool, he will still be a beast with high OBP's (12.3% BB%). Buy any discount you can on Casas, especially in OBP and 6+ hitting cat leagues. He's going to be a monster. - 2025 Projection: 86/32/94/.253/.348/.514/1

75) Matt Shaw - CHC, 3B/2B/SS, 23.4 - The little man discount never fails. Baseball scouts see a little man, and they immediately shave a few inches of projection right off the top. I don't mind it, because it consistently creates excellent buying opportunities for the right players, and Matt Shaw is definitely one of those right players. He went a little later than he should have in the real MLB Draft, then he went a little later than he should have in Dynasty First Year Player Drafts, and now he's getting ranked a little later than he should be on prospect lists. He's an elite prospect that gets ranked like a merely good one. He's under 6'0'', but his bat packs a true punch, putting up an 89.3 MPH EV with a 14.6 degree launch in 35 games at Triple-A. He smoked 21 homers on the season in 121 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. He's not a pull machine, but a lot of these lift and pull machines put up some pretty low batting averages, and a profile like Shaw doesn't need to only pull the ball. He can use his hard hit ability, plus speed (31 steals), and plus contact rates (18.2% K%) to do damage when he goes oppo. He also walks a ton with a 11.9% BB%, making him a likely top of the order bat. Don't fall into the little man trap, Shaw is going to be a do everything fantasy terror when he gets his shot, and with the Isaac Paredes/Cam Smith trade, that shot could come on Opening Day. Shaw's been a target for me from before his junior year of college, and he remains a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 79/18/77/.256/.318/.423/23 Prime Projection: 96/23/83/.276/.348/.461/26

76) Carson Williams - TBR, SS, 21.2 - Williams put up a 31.8% K% in 105 games at High-A in 2023, so the worry was that the K rate would explode against upper minors pitching, but that didn't happen. It actually improved at Double-A with a 28.5% K%, and that was good enough to let his special talent shine. He jacked 20 homers with 33 steals, a 11.5% BB% and a 142 wRC+ in 115 games. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 180 pounds with an explosive righty swing that is made to launch homers. He's also an excellent athlete with plus speed and plus SS defense. Tampa's long term SS job is literally waiting for him (the Kim signing could impact Williams' projected playing time for 2025, but it's better for his long term development anyway to take it slow), and because of his plus defense, he is sure to have all the leash he can handle even if it takes his hit tool a year or two to adjust to MLB pitching. If he can keep the K% in the high 20's, he will be a beast, and if he can continue to improve on it at only 21 years old, there is near elite dynasty asset upside. - 2025 Projection: 21/7/29/.230/.300/.424/9 Prime Projection: 89/28/96/.254/.334/.483/23

77) Leodalis De Vries - SDP, SS, 18.6 - De Vries is my pick to be the #1 overall fantasy prospect in baseball by this time next year (in a tight race with Walker Jenkins and Sebastian Walcott), that is unless he loses rookie eligibility because San Diego are madmen when it comes to promoting their elite prospects. There are already rumors they are considering calling De Vries and Salas up in 2025, which is straight wild. It did work out for Jackson Merrill, so who am I to judge? Merrill was 20 years old of course while De Vries and Salas are 18, but I love to see a team pushing the limits and setting new upper standards on how fast a prospect can fly through the minors. And De Vries has the type of talent that just might be able to pull it off. He was sent straight to full season ball for his pro debut, and while it took him a few months to find his footing, he went gangbusters once he did, slashing .275/.400/.563 with 11 homers, 8 steals, and a 20.5/14.9 K%/BB% in his final 40 games. Even with the early struggles, he still put up a 116 wRC+ in 75 games which is just silly for a 17 year old. The thing that separates De Vries from Jenkins, Walcott and De Paula for me, is that there are zero questions about him getting to his raw power. He put up a 32.4% GB%, 49.3% FB%, and 49.5% Pull%. I fully believe those other guys will get to their raw power as well, don't get me wrong, but De Vries seems to be one step ahead of them in that area. His season ended in mid August with a shoulder injury, but he's playing in the AFL, and while he's not playing especially well, it's still nice to see the shoulder isn't an issue. He's an elite prospect right now, and if he doesn't end up at #1, he won't be far off. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 91/31/99/.271/.353/.513/20

78) Walker Jenkins - MIN, OF, 20.1 - My Kyle Tucker comp for Jenkins last off-season turned out to be eerily accurate, at least for what they each did in their first full year of pro ball as 19 year old's. Tucker had 9 homers with 32 steals and a 16.3/10.1 K%/BB% in 117 games in the lower minors, while Jenkins had 6 homers with 17 steals and a 12.8/15.2 K%/BB% in 82 games. Like Jenkins, Tucker also wasn't a burner, and nobody really expected the steal totals to stick in the majors, but they did. And like Jenkins, the only thing that hadn't fully developed yet was the power, but Tucker had a monster power explosion the very next season, hitting 25 homers in 120 games split between High-A and Double-A. I see no reason why Jenkins can't have that same power explosion at 6'3'', 210 pounds with one of the sweetest lefty swings this game has ever seen. He doesn't hit the ball on the ground too much and he can pull it, so while his hard hit numbers weren't too impressive, they weren't too bad either, and it would be pretty shocking if he didn't develop impact power. He's on a beeline for elite dynasty asset, and he's among the favorites to be the #1 prospect in baseball by the middle of 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 103/27/96/.282/.365/.504/18

79) Shane McClanahan - TBR, LHP, 27.1 - McClanahan underwent Tommy John surgery in late August 2023 and missed all 2024, so he should be a full go for 2025, and he’s the type of pitcher I love taking the Tommy John surgery discount on. He’s established on the MLB level and his upside is elite. Before going down with the injury he was throwing a 96.8 MPH fastball with an elite changeup (54.1% whiff%) and two decent breaking balls. His whiff rates are elite with a 33.4% whiff% and his control is about average with a 8.7% BB%. He’ll be just 27 years at the start of the 2025 season. This is his 2nd Tommy John surgery, and we just saw Walker Buehler struggle hard coming back from his 2nd Tommy John, so there is undeniably risk here (that is why he is ranked here and not 40 spots higher), but his track record, performance, and youth makes him a great target to take the TJ discount on. 2025 Projection: 12/3.63/1.20/162 in 150 IP

80) Spencer Steer - CIN, 1B/OF, 27.4 - Good luck trying to predict stolen bases. Steer was quite bad at stealing bases in the minors, and barely ran. He went 0 for 1 in his 28 game MLB debut in 2022. And then over the last two year he's become one of the better base stealers in the majors. He went 15 for 18 in 2023 and then 25 for 28 in 2024. His 28.2 ft/sec sprint speed is definitely plenty fast enough to steal bags if you are good at it, and it seems Steer has been putting in the work on that part of his game. It's a big deal for his fantasy value, because he already had a strong plate approach and above average game power. He had a 20.9%/11.0% K%/BB% with an 88 MPH EV, 17.4 degree launch, and a 44.4% Pull%. With the newfound stolen bases, that should make him a perennial .250/20+/20+ guy for the next several years. And if he can find just a hair more raw power in his late 20's, there could be a big career year or two mixed in there. Defense is his biggest problem as he isn't good anywhere on the field, but he has versatility (he can play every position but CF), and he's not terrible at any of them either. I'm not really concerned about his playing time at all. I've been high on Steer since his breakout in the upper minors in 2022, and I'll continue to be high on him. - 2025 Projection: 71/21/80/.253/.339/.456/14 Update: Received a cortisone shot in his shoulder and will start the year on the IL. This shouldn't hurt his long term value too much, but I'm concerned he won't run as much this year. I'm dinging him

81) Jose Altuve - HOU, 2B, 34.11 - It seems as if we can finally say that Altuve is in the decline phase of his career with a career worst .316 xwOBA (not including the shortened 2020 season). His 22.1% whiff% and 37.3% Chase% were both career worsts by a decent margin. His 27.1 ft/sec sprint is way down from his prime (28.6 ft/sec in his prime). But even in a decline phase Altuve went .295/20/22. He could always pull it, but his 55.6% Pull% was a career high, so we know Altuve is going to continue to aim for the fences even in decline, and even with declining speed he can still steal bags, even though he also got caught 7 times. Like Freeman, I would say now is definitely the time to pull the trigger on an Altuve trade, even in win now mode. Any more signs of decline, or a down year, will absolutely tank his dynasty trade value. As I said, it's better to be a year early, than a year late. - 2025 Projection: 96/24/69/.286/.348/.465/18

82) Eury Perez - MIA, RHP, 21.11 - Perez underwent Tommy John surgery in April 2024, which could keep him out until mid-season 2025, although I haven't heard a timeline yet. This is just unfortunately part of the process with owning young flamethrowers, so you can't panic when this inevitability hits, especially with pitchers who have best pitcher in baseball upside, like Eury has. Here was my blurb for him in the 2024 Top 1,000 before the injury, and my thoughts remain the same assuming he gets back to full health: "Perez is going to be one of the greatest pitchers we’ve ever seen. He’s 6’8”, 220 pounds with a 97.5 MPH fastball and 3 double plus to elite secondaries. The slider notched a 47.7% whiff% and .226 xwOBA, the curve notched a 54.3% whiff% and .216 xwOBA, and the changeup notched a 46.2% whiff% and .161 xwOBA. He was 20 years old in the majors and put up a pitching line of 3.15/1.13/108/31 in 91.1 IP. The 33.7% whiff% is elite. He’s never had control problems in his career and that will probably end up plus too. The only thing that could stop him is injuries, which unfortunately has to be factored in for all young flamethrowers who have yet to throw a full MLB workload (128 IP is his career high)." ... it didn't take Nostradamus to know where the risk lied, and even though that risk played out, I'm still all in on Eury. 2025 Projection: 5/3.72/1.22/97 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.05/0.99/230 in 180 IP

83) Andrew Painter - PHI, RHP, 22.0 - Painter underwent Tommy John surgery in late July 2023 and missed the entire 2024 regular season, but he got healthy in time for the AFL, and he's gone right back to dominating with a 2.30 ERA, 0.89 WHIP, and 18/4 K/BB in 15.2 IP over 6 outings. Just seeing that he was able to ramp up and start pitching in games without getting re-injured is a big first step that we can cross off our worry list this off-season. But he's also proving he is nearly 100% healthy with the plus to double plus fastball sitting mid to upper 90's. Like we saw with Shane Baz, it seems that breaking ball crispness and consistency can be something that lags behind after Tommy John, but long term the slider projects as plus and he also throws a lesser used curve and change that could end up plus pitches in their own right. If you ignore the injury, he's basically a perfect pitching prospect with size, athleticism, velocity, double plus fastball, plus secondary, diverse pitch mix, and plus control. And now that we've seen him back on the mound and thriving, the injury risk is a bit lessened. He moves back into my top spot among pitching prospects after his AFL performance, but it's still a tight race with Noah Schultz, who I absolutely love. It was announced the Phillies plan to slow play him in 2025, which his ETA in the majors around July, and if that helps keep him healthy, avoiding the end of season dilemma for a contending team where he's at his innings limit, I'm all for it. - 2025 Projection: 6/3.68/1.20/86 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 15/2.95/0.91/225 in 180 IP

84) Noah Schultz - CHW, LHP, 21.8 - Baby Johnson is the #1B pitching prospect in baseball, and while there are other really good contenders (Jobe, Bubba, Kumar), Schultz holds this spot for being absolutely unprecedented. Even the Baby Johnson nickname might not fit, as Randy Johnson had an insane 318 walks in 400.1 minor league IP before getting the call to the bigs. Schultz is 6'9'', 220 pounds with an almost sidearm lefty delivery that he uses to fire a mid to upper 90's fastball and double plus slider (he also mixes in a cutter and a change). He sliced through the minor with absolutely no problem, putting up a 2.24 ERA with a 32.1/6.7% K%/BB% in 88.1 IP at mostly Double-A. Having that level of control as a 20/21 year old at that size with that kind of stuff is really mind blowing. He's not a finished product as he's yet to eclipse 4 IP in any outing of his career and he needs to continue to work on a good third/fourth pitch, but the combination of floor/upside is simply off the charts. Other than Roki Sasaki (who really shouldn't be considered a prospect), and Painter now that he's healthy, there is no other pitching prospect I would take over Schultz. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.71/1.24/82 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.05/1.01/230 in 180 IP

85) Pablo Lopez - MIN, RHP, 29.1 - Lopez very clearly got unlucky in 2024 with a 4.08 ERA vs. 3.67 xERA, but he's gotten "unlucky" in 5 of the 7 years of his career, so he's starting to make a habit out of it. It still doesn't change the fact that he is an easy target for me, likely now falling into that area where I go after my most expensive starters. His 25.6/5.3 K%/BB% was still very good, and a 27% whiff% overall is well above average. The 95 MPH fastball was the 12th most valuable 4-seamer in baseball with a 15 Run Value. The sweeper is plus with a .259 xwOBA and 33.1% whiff%. The changeup is about average, and the lesser used curve is above average with a .262 xwOBA and 34.1% whiff%. The secondaries were the pitches to get unlucky in 2024, and the fastball was the pitch to get unlucky in 2023, so it genuinely could just be that he's getting unlucky. If his luck turns in 2025, he has the potential to be on the better pitchers in the game. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.51/1.14/201 in 185 IP

86) Freddy Peralta - MIL, RHP, 28.10 - Peralta is just about as close as you can get to a true fantasy ace without actually quite being one. His ERA's have been a bit too high over the last 3 years to put him in that category, but he did put up true ace numbers in 2021 (albeit in 144.1 IP), and I definitely think he has the capability to put up some truly special seasons again. He's a bat missing machine with 4 above average to plus pitches that all rack up whiffs. It led to a 31% whiff%. He has a 31.7% whiff% in his career. That is straight elite for a starter. The control is a bit below average, but nothing too bad, and he doesn't get hit very hard with a 87.6 MPH EV against. He also stayed healthy this year and put up a career high 173.2 IP. It resulted in a 3.68 ERA with a 27.6/9.4 K%/BB%. He's the type of pitcher who I love to build my staff around. I don't like fully paying up for the hyped to death aces, but I also don't want to have to build an entire staff solely from the bargain bin. So Peralta always seems to fall into that goldilocks zone of ace level upside without having to quite pay ace level prices. No matter the league, I always seem to end up with Peralta on a bunch of teams. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.49/1.15/200 in 170 IP

87) Spencer Schwellenbach - ATL, RHP, 24.10 - Schwellenbach was a major mid-season target of mine, ringing the 5 alarm target bell in my Rundowns and Dynasty Rankings even when the ERA was over 5.00, writing, "Schwellenbach is officially one of the most exciting young starters in the game. He has the big velocity, he has the big pitch mix, he has plus control, he induces weak contact, he has above average whiffs, and he has three plus secondaries. He’s starting to look like a young near ace." ... and then he finished the season with a 3.35 ERA and 25.4/4.6 K%/BB% in 123.2 IP, universally considered one of the more exciting young pitchers in the game. The buy low window has most certainly been shut for awhile now, but he's still worth acquiring at his new high price. He throws a legit 6 pitch mix and all of the pitches are good. The fastball sits 96.1 MPH and his curve and splitter are his two best bat missing weapons with a 40.9 and 46.3 whiff%. He induces weak contact (4.9% Barrel%), misses bats (27.4% whiff%) and has elite control (top 5% BB% in the league). He's an easy #2 with true ace potential ... as long as he stays healthy. He missed the entire 2022 season with Tommy John surgery, and he really hasn't pitched very much in his career. It's a major question if he can truly put up a true MLB starter workload year after year. I tend to be less risk averse with pitchers, because all of them are risky, but I am factoring in some experience/injury risk here, keeping him in that 2nd tier of young aces. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.48/1.10/163 in 155 IP

88) Willy Adames - SFG, SS, 29.7 - Adames stole a career high 21 bags and he did it with great efficiency too (only 4 CS). His previous career high was 8 and he's been a super bad base stealer his entire career. It's not like he was a burner or anything either with about average speed. Predicting steals has always been hard, and now with the new rules/bases, it is downright impossible. The newfound base stealing skills gave him the upside boost that he needed, because he's always been able to hit for power, and he hit a career high 32 homers in a career high 161 games in 2024. He's a batting average risk because the launch is extreme (20.6 degrees), the raw power is more above average than beastly (93 MPH FB/LD EV), and he whiffs a lot with a 29.5% whiff%. But now that we can count on him, or at least hope for him to steal around 15 bags, it takes some of the edge off the batting risk. The biggest issue is that he just signed a 7 year, $182 million contract with the Giants, which gives him a monster ballpark downgrade. Milwaukee was the 7th best park for righty homers while San Francisco is dead last by a mile. Hitting the ball in the air a ton with a solid, but not great EV, and whiffing a lot, seems like a recipe for a very low batting average. It also caps that homer upside a bit. His Statcast expected homer total in SF was still 31, so I don't want to tank his value, but I'm a bit less apt to pay up big for Adames now than I was before the signing. - 2025 Projection: 79/27/90/.240/.320/.455/13

89) Jordan Westburg - BAL, 2B/3B, 26.1 - I've been saying that Mark Vientos was my best target call of 2024, but Westburg isn't far behind. I closed out his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "That is a pretty Teflon combination of skills to have. While Gunnar and Adley hog all the attention on the MLB level, and Holliday, Mayo, Basallo etc … hog all the attention on prospect lists, you should sneakily tip toe in there and steal Westburg from his current owner like a thief in the night." ... that teflon combination of skills I was talking about showed back up in 2024, and this time it unsurprisingly resulted in an excellent season with 18 homers, 6 steals, a 21.7% K% and 125 wRC+ in 107 games (he missed almost two months with a fractured hand but returned before the end of the season). He smokes the ball with a 11.8% Barrel%, 91.1/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch and 46.1% Hard Hit%. He has plus speed with a 29 ft/sec sprint, he gets the bat on the ball with a 21.7% K%, and he's an above average defender at 3B. The 4.9% BB% was low, but he doesn't have any major chase issues, so I'm not too concerned about that. Like Cowser, I don't love that he was only 6 for 9 on the bases. As much as I like the bat, that base stealing element is big to put the profile over the top, and it seems we can't really count on that. It prevents him from truly blowing up, but it doesn't prevent him from being a Top 100 dynasty asset. - 2025 Projection: 79/26/87/.269/.325/.473/9

90) Josh Naylor - ARI, 1B, 27.9 - Naylor crushed a career high by far 31 homers in 152 games, and while my first reaction is that he got lucky and this isn't sustainable, it actually might not be all that far off from his true talent level. For one, he played in a career high games by far too (122 games was his previous career high). And he hits the ball damn hard with a 94.3 MPH FB/LD EV. He's not a huge lift and pull guy, but his 11.1 degree launch with a 41.6% Pull% is fine, and he puts the ball in play a ton with a 16.6% K%. Sure 31 homers is on the high side, but it's not like it's some crazy total he couldn't possibly repeat. And on the flip side, his .243 BA was unlucky with a .246 BABIP (career .282 BABIP). He finished 30th overall on the Razzball Player Rater and is currently going 92nd overall in NFBC drafts, so that tells me that everyone is expecting regression, but I think there is a real chance he could put up a few really big seasons in these prime man muscle late 20's years. If he had remained in Cleveland or got traded to a better ballpark, I could see lightly targeting him, but in Arizona, who has one of the worst ballparks for lefty homers, it's harder to still feel that way. Like everyone else now, I'm hesitant to buy off the big season and now looming ballpark downgrade. - 2025 Projection: 77/25/88/.266/.331/.463/7

91) Royce Lewis - MIN, 3B, 25.10 - The constant lower body injuries seems to have finally worn on Lewis, especially in the 2nd half, where he slashed .191/.236/.257 with 1 homer, 0 steals, and a 24.2/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 42 games. His speed also fell off a cliff with a well below average 26.6 ft/sec sprint which is in the bottom 28% of the league. Considering he injured his quad pretty seriously in the first game of the season when he tried to turn the jets on rounding 2nd base (he missed 2 months), it's understandable that he might not have wanted to really go full speed when he returned. He missed another month of the season in July with a groin injury. So it's also understandable that he didn't attempt a single steal all season. While it's understandable, it doesn't make it good for fantasy, and if we can't count on him being a true contributor in steals, which we can't, it definitely takes a nice chunk out of his fantasy value. It's not only steals though, his power production took a big step back too with his EV falling 3.1 MPH to 87.1 MPH. The plate skills are average at best with a 22.8/8.6 K%/BB%. And of course, he keeps getting hurt, playing in only 82 games. It looked like Royce was ascending as one of the young stars in the game in the first half of the season, but when it was all said and done, it was a really mediocre year. He still hit 16 homers with a 11.2% Barrel%, and if he gets healthy this off-season, I'm sure his speed and EV can bounce back, so I would still value him as a Top 100 dynasty asset, but considering the injuries, lack of steals, declining hard hit, and terrible finish to the season, I just don't see how you can really value him in that young star tier right now. - 2025 Projection: 70/25/84/.262/.328/.475/5

92) Teoscar Hernandez - LAD, OF, 32.6 - Teoscar's numbers tanked in 2023 playing in Seattle, one of the worst hitter's parks in the league, and it just makes you think what Julio could be capable of if he played in a better park. But back to Teoscar, not only did he bounce back with LA in 2024, he arguably had the best season of his career, slashing .272/.339/.501 with 33 homers, 12 steals, and a 28.8/8.1 K%/BB% in 154 games. As always he smashed the ball with plus bat speed and plus foot speed. He swings and misses a lot with a 34% whiff%, but he's been sitting there his entire career and he still has a career .263 BA in 3,861 PA, so I wouldn't be worried about that. Returning to the Dodgers (4th best park for righty homers in 2024) was the best case scenario for him. - 2025 Projection: 80/28/93/.261/.328/.490/9

93) Marcell Ozuna - ATL, DH, 34.5 - Not only did Ozuna fully back up his breakout/bounce back/career year that he had in 2023, but he actually topped it with a career high 154 wRC+ (not counting the shortened 2020 season). His .402 xwOBA was 7th best in all baseball and his 92.2 MPH EV was the 2nd best mark of his career. It's unsurprising to learn he swings a wicked quick bat with a 74 MPH swing that is in double plus range. At 34 years old, expecting a 3rd season in a row of being truly one of the best hitters in baseball seems too much to count on, but I have zero doubts that the guy is going to rake. He's an excellent win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 85/34/101/.275/.342/.526/1

94) Tanner Bibee - CLE, RHP, 26.1 - Nothing is really off the charts or huge wow factor with Bibee. He is just really, really good across the board. He backed up his excellent rookie year in 2023 with an equally good season in 2024. He put up a 3.47 ERA with a 26.3/6.2 K%/BB% in 173.2 IP. His 94.6 MPH fastball put up a respectable 21.3% whiff%, his 86.5 MPH cutter is one of the best cutters in baseball with a 36.5% whiff% and +13 run value, his changeup and slider induce weak contact and miss bats, and he throws a decent curve too. His control/command leveled up into the plus area, which helps everything play up even further. He's not quite at true ace level, but he's really the perfect embodiment of a #2 starter. I feel like the #2 starter label often gets lost in the shuffle between "ace" and "mid-rotation" guy, but somebody has to slot in at a #2, and that man's name is Tanner Bibee. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.53/1.15/187 in 175 IP

95) Luis Castillo - SEA, RHP, 32.4 - It seems that Castillo might have entered the decline phase in 2024. He didn't have his best season with a 3.64 ERA and 24.3/6.5 K%/BB% in 175.1 IP. There are real signs of decline with his fastball down a tick to a still very good 95.6 MPH, and his whiff% down to a career low by far 25.9% (still above average). He's 32 years old, and while I still think he is an excellent win now piece (hence the high ranking), we might have to shave off some of the upside as he gets deeper into his 30's. The other side of me thinks Castillo is the perfect example of not trying to slice and dice the numbers too much for a proven veteran stud. It's normal to have ebbs and flows in a long career. Either way, this is the point in an aces career when they actually start to fall into my range for dynasty. I love that little few year period of the start of a decline, but still far from the end. That is where I eat. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.55/1.15/188 in 182 IP

96) Aaron Nola - PHI, RHP, 31.10 - The ERA's may fluctuate, the strikeouts may be on the way down, but there is something to be said about getting consistent 200 IP seasons of about #2 starter production. I love building the bulk of my rotation with the more volatile, young upside types, but when you can mix in a guy like Nola, who you can trust to take the mound every 5th game and produce good numbers, it provides such an anchor to your rotation. And Nola's hype/value is far from the days when he was out of my preferred price range, placing him in that perfect area of low end aces/high end #2's which is where I start to hunt for my most expensive starters. There does seem to be some real decline here with an essentially career low 24% K%, and the K's have been coming down for years now, but he's still only 31 years old, and he's the type of crafty pitcher who can art of pitching his way into a productive career possibly into his late 30's. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.62/1.16/190 in 190 IP

97) Bailey Ober - MIN, RHP, 29.9 - Ober has basically been performing like a #2 fantasy starter for 4 years now, and in 2024 he proved he was able to do it over a full starter's workload with 178.2 IP. His changeup leveled up to elite status with a .202 xwOBA and 39.5% whiff%. It was the 10th most valuable changeup in baseball. The 91.7 MPH fastball doesn't blow the doors off, but it's an above average pitch. And his slider gives him another plus pitch with a .191 xwOBA and 30.7% whiff%. He also mixes in a solid cutter. And of course what you are buying is the plus control over the entire arsenal. His 6.1% BB% with a 29% whiff% is a pretty special control/whiff combo. It all resulted in a 3.98 ERA with a 26.9/6.1 K%/BB%, and the 3.22 xERA shows his true talent level was even better than that. He's firmly a #2, and there is upside in here for some low end ace seasons. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.45/1.04/185 in 175 IP

98) Joe Ryan - MIN, RHP, 28.10 - Ryan's season ended on August 7th with a shoulder injury, but he's expected to be good to go for 2025, so I wouldn't ding him too much for it even though it isn't great. It's too bad he got hurt, because he was in the process of fixing the only weakness of his game, which is the secondaries. His splitter jumped up to above average with a .255 xwOBA and 25.8% whiff% (still weak), and the sweeper was plus with a .180 xwOBA and 33.7% whiff%, although he got unlucky on the pitch. Seeing the development of those secondaries is huge, because not only did he maintain his elite fastball, he actually improved on it with the velocity up 1.7 MPH to 94 MPH. It put up a .265 xwOBA with a 27.5% whiff%. It all resulted in a 3.60 ERA, 2.87 xERA, and a 27.3/4.3 K%/BB% in 135 IP. At the very least, Ryan locked in #2 starter status, and at best he hinted at an ace breakout coming in 2025, assuming full health. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.48/1.05/185 in 170 IP

99) Zac Gallen - ARI, RHP, 29.8 - Gallen is settling in as a quintessential #2 fantasy starter. You want your ace, optimally, to be putting up those under 3 ERA, over 30% K rate seasons, which Gallen won't give you, but he will give you a 3.65 ERA with a 25.1/8.7 K%/BB% in 148 IP (he missed time with a hamstring injury, so there is no long term concern there). His curve was the most valuable curve in baseball in 2024 with a +13 Run Value (.208 xwOBA with a 39.2% K%), and while he won't blow you away, the velocity is holding strong at 93.7 MPH. He's in the prime of his career and he's as reliable as they come with a career 3.29 ERA and 26.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 815.1 IP. 2025 Projection: 14/3.40/1.16/188 in 180 IP

100) Anthony Volpe - NYY, SS, 23.11 - Volpe has a well below average 69.5 MPH swing, and I gotta say, it has me shook. Maybe slowing his swing down was all part of the process to improve his hit tool last off-season, and to his credit, his hit tool did improve, going from a .209 BA and 27.8% K% to a .243 BA and 22.6% K%. But that still isn't a good hit tool, so the tradeoff was not even close to worth it. If he's going to swing that slow, he needs to make near elite contact, or he needs to be a lift and pull machine, which he was before making this ill fated adjustment. He had a 14.2 degree launch and 45.6% Pull% in 2023, resulting in 21 homers, which he then flipped to a 8.4 degree launch and 32.1% Pull%, resulting in 12 homers. Honestly, whoever was the catalyst for this change of approach needs to answer to this terrible strategy. The one real positive to his 2024 was that he stole 28 bags despite a .293 OBP, so it's clear he's going to rack up steals. He obviously can't be happy with his offensive season, so I'm sure he's going to go back in the lab this off-season. I wish we had swing speed data from 2023, so we can see if this is just his true talent level, or if he slowed his swing down in 2024 on purpose, but with well below average swing speed like that, and without elite plate skills, his upside is going to be capped. I don't want to overrate swing speed, and I don't want to assume he's locked in here after a one year sample where he changed his swing. I think Volpe will be able to combine the two approaches and become a very good power/speed threat, but I can't lie, the swing speed scares me a bit, and prevents me from sticking my neck too far out for him. 2025 Projection: 88/18/66/.249/.317/.415/31

101) Jordan Lawlar - ARI, SS, 22.9 - Lawlar had a completely lost season in 2024 due to a broken thumb and hamstring injury, playing in just 23 games. He's no stranger to injuries as he also underwent major shoulder surgery in 2021. Out of sight, out of mind never loses in the prospecting industry, but Lawlar is the type of talent where you should fight that urge. He already had a huge year in the upper minors in 2023, and he's only 22, so I don't think lost development time should be a major consideration here. Even in the 23 games he played this year he put up .900 OPS, and he then got sent to the grown man Dominican Winter League and isn't embarrassing himself with a .670 OPS. Just the fact he's playing and getting reps in a league where everyone doesn't put up silly numbers like the AFL is another reason to not get too hung up on the lost season. He has the potential for a special power/speed combo (20 homers and 36 steals in 105 games in 2023), and while there is some hit tool risk, it's not really in that extreme zone with around mid 20 strikeout rates throughout his career. He's not a finished product, and I would expect him to start the year in the minors, but Lawlar will be up eventually in 2025, and he can make a big impact immediately. Don't ding him too much for the injuries. 2025 Projection: 55/14/57/.241/.312/.417/21 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.266/.339/.459/38

102) Jacob deGrom - TEX, RHP, 36.9 - I was all over the Tommy John (and age) discount on deGrom last off-season, writing, "We can dig into past arms who returned from 2 Tommy John surgeries (Nathan Eovaldi), but the bottom line is that an elite of the elite player like deGrom can be compared to nobody. Even if he takes one or two steps back, he is coming from such a high place that he will still be a legit ace." It took him a bit longer to return than hoped, but slow and steady wins the race, and as predicted, even with his velocity down 1.4 MPH to 97.3 MPH, he was still such an easy elite ace with a 1.69 ERA and 31.8/2.3 K%/BB% in 10.2 IP. Sure it's a small sample, but do you really need to see more? Of course we need to see more in terms of can he stay healthy and for how many innings, but there is little to no doubt that what he's going to do in those innings is be an elite pitcher. Will his whiff rates be over 40% like they were in 2020-23, highly unlikely, but that is why I was so keen to go after him last off-season. Even if he took two big steps back, he's still possibly the best starter in baseball. That is how far out in front of the pack he was. He hasn't pitched more than 92 IP since 2019, but from 2017-19 he threw over 200 IP, so it's not like he's some guy who has never ever stayed healthy. If his arm can have a few year grace period after the surgery, I don't think it's out of the question for him to rack up innings, even if you can't count on it. In win now mode, he might be untouchable for me, and in a rebuild, you should net at minimum a Top 100 dynasty asset, and even that could be selling him short. 2025 Projection: 12/2.98/0.97/178 in 140 IP

Shadow102) Shohei Ohtani - LAD, RHP, 30.9 - This is where I would rank Ohtani as a pitcher only. He underwent an internal brace procedure which knocked him out for all of 2024 pitching wise, but he was threatening to possibly pitch in the post-season, so it seems the elbow is feeling good. Unfortunately, he then went out and tore his non pitching shoulder in the World Series, which required surgery in early November. They claim he will be ready to pitch in games by May, but that it is all going to depend on how it is healing. And their focus is clearly going to be on getting Ohtani back to 100% for the postseason. When healthy, he is a true ace with a 3.01 ERA and 31.2/8.9 K%/BB% in 481.2 career IP, but we don't know exactly how healthy he will be (this was his 2nd major elbow surgery in 5 years, not to mention the non pitching shoulder surgery), and we definitely can't count on him racking up innings. 2025 Projection: 9/3.41/1.19/142 in 120 IP

103) Logan Webb - SFG, RHP, 28.5 - I've always been a bit low on Webb relative to consensus, and it seems that consensus has now regressed more towards my valuation of him. He just doesn't strikeout enough batters to be super exciting for fantasy with a 20.5% K% in 2024 and a career 22% K%. He's reliable, he racks up innings, he has plus control, and his sinker was the 3rd most valuable sinker in baseball behind only Skenes and Wheeler, so he's still a #2 fantasy starter despite the lack of strikeouts. 2025 Projection: 13/3.38/1.14/171 in 195 IP

104) Seiya Suzuki - CHC, OF, 30.8 - Seiya has a collection of skills that seems on the brink of absolutely exploding. He put up an 11.5% Barrel%, 91.7 MPH EV, 16.2 degree launch, 24.5% whiff%, 20.7% Chase%, 28.3 ft/sec sprint and a 73 MPH swing. He already did kinda quietly blow up in 2024 with a 138 wRC+, and while the power/speed numbers weren't off the charts with 21 homers and 16 steals in 132 games, both of those were career highs too. He's 30 years old, so it's hard to say I'm really expecting a true blow up, but at the same time, he only came stateside in 2022, so maybe there is more upside in here than your typical 30 year old. The floor is very high, and I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a special season or two here coming up. I like Suzuki a lot. 2025 Projection: 85/25/85/.270/.348/.478/14

105) Mark Vientos - NYM, 3B, 25.3 - I was all over Vientos last off-season as a major target like it was my job (wait ... it was my job), writing, " Vientos is one of the premier up and coming power hitters in the game, and he gets valued like he's barely worth discussing." His truly elite power was staring me right in the face, and when he finally got the opportunity in 2024, he unsurprisingly went gangbusters. He jacked out 27 homers in 111 regular season games, and then he ripped 5 dingers in 13 post-season games. The 91.2/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV and 14.1% Barrel% fully back up the power. He was also better than expected at the hot corner, playing a serviceable 3B. The contact rates and plate approach weren't good, but they did actually take a step forward from 2023 with a 29.7/7.3 K%/BB%. That isn't good enough to say he is now one of the elite power hitters in the game, really putting him in that 2nd tier of power hitter. He also didn't steal a single bag, and while you don't roster him for steals, the difference between a guy who nabs like 7 bags vs. zero starts to add up in your lineup. The time to acquire Vientos was last off-season, so I can no longer call him a true target, but his 2024 season was certainly real, and if he can continue to improve the plate skills, he has the potential to join the elite tier of power hitters. - 2025 Projection: 78/34/93/.252/.321/.520/1

106) Anthony Santander - TOR, OF, 30.6 - Santander hit a career high by far 44 homers, and it's pretty clearly a career year. All of his underlying numbers were in line with career norms, and his .345 wOBA was much better than his .324 xwOBA. That's not to say he isn't a power hitting beast, because he is with an 11.7% Barrel%, 94.6 MPH FB/LD, 22.7 degree launch, and 19.4% K%. He's going to rip homers no matter where he lands (the Blue Jays have an above average park for righty homers and a below average park for lefty homers), but it's going to come with a mediocre BA and OBP (hit hit .235 with a .308 OBP even in this career year), so I would shy away from overpaying based on the career year. 2025 Projection: 83/34/95/.249/.318/.480/3

107) Bryan Reynolds - PIT, OF, 30.2 - Just another year of putting in Yeoman's Work for Reynolds with a .275 BA, 24 homers and 10 steals in 156 games. It's not flashy but it was good enough to be a Top 50 dynasty player in 2024 (45th overall). He's so consistently boring with more or less these exact same numbers for the last 4 years. He put up a 118 wRC+ this year and he has a career 120 wRC+. He put up a .350 xwOBA this year and he has a career .354 xwOBA. Safe to say, I think you know what you are getting from Reynolds. 2025 Projection: 83/24/85/.271/.342/.454/10

108) Jack Flaherty - DET, RHP, 29.6 - Score one for track record, as Flaherty turned the clock back to 2018-19 and put up the 3rd true ace season of his career in 2024 with a 3.17 ERA and 29.9/5.9 K%/BB% in 162 IP. It just goes to show that if a player demonstrates a certain level of play, even if it was years ago (and assuming they are still in their physical prime), that it should still be taken into consideration when evaluating them (Bo Bichette is smiling somewhere). I closed out his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "If his control can bounce back to prime levels, he definitely can put together a good season," and not only did his control bounce back to prime levels, it hit career best levels. That was exactly what propelled him back in time to his ace days, because his stuff was basically the same as it has been his entire career. His 93.3 MPH fastball was above average with a +5 Run Value. His curveball was tied for the 2nd most valuable curve in the game with a +12 Run Value, 43.6% K%, and .214 xwOBA. And his above average slider missed a ton of bats with a 36.3% whiff%. He wasn't quite as good with LA as he was in Detroit, putting up a 3.58 ERA with a 26.1/8.1 K%/BB% in his final 55.1 IP (he also got destroyed in the playoffs), so I think that is a more fair expectation going forward. I'm projecting him as a #2 starter. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.63/1.18/180 in 165 IP

109) Hunter Brown - HOU, RHP, 26.7 - Brown got off to a horrific start to the season with a 8.89 ERA and 21.2/13.1 K%/BB% in his first 27.1 IP, and coming off a rookie year where he put up a 5.09 ERA, it was starting to get worrisome, but he was an absolute demon the rest of the way. He put up a 2.46 ERA with a 26.1/7.3 K%/BB% in his final 142.2 IP. He threw a 6 pitch mix and 5 of the 6 pitches put up a plus run value. His 96 MPH 4-seamer is his best pitch and is bordering on elite with a .282 xwOBA and 28.8% whiff%. He doesn't really have one wipeout secondary, but the changeup, curve and slider all had above average xwOBA's. He also throws a sinker and cutter, giving him 3 fastballs. The whiff rates are only about average overall with a 25.1% whiff%, and the control is also about average with a 8.4% BB%, so I can't really put him in the true young ace tier, but he's in the tier right under that. He's looking like a strong #2 starter for years to come. 2025 Projection: 13/3.53/1.23/188 in 175 IP

110) Max Fried - NYY, LHP, 31.3 - Fried had his usual ace to near ace season with a 3.25 ERA and 23.2/8.0 K%/BB% in 174.1 IP, but there were a couple of things to pop up that could be seen as red flags if he isn't quite as good as he gets deeper into his 30's. The control took a step back with his BB% rising 2.2 percentage points to 8.0%, and that held all season, so it wasn't just a first half thing. His swing and miss was also down with his whiff% dropping 3.1% to 24.1%. Inducing weak contact with a low launch is his bread and butter, and that was still in prime form with a 86.3 MPH EV and 3 degree launch, and his changeup still put up a 37.1% whiff%, so I'm too worried, but I do think it's worth pointing out the small steps back as he heads into his age 31 year old season. I've said this in a bunch of other vets blurbs, but I don't like to slice and dice the numbers too much from proven vets who are still in their prime(ish) years, so while I'll notice the little red flags, I may not act on them too much. Fried should have a few more top level seasons left in him, and the Yanks obviously weren't too concerned, handing him an 8 year, $218 million contract. 2025 Projection: 14/3.29/1.14/169 in 175 IP

111) Justin Steele - CHC, LHP, 29.8 - Nobody really wanted to fully buy into Steele's 2023 breakout, and now that he fully backed it up in 2024 with a 3.07 ERA and 24.3/6.7 K%/BB% in 134.2 IP ... still nobody is really buying into it (128 NFBC ADP). His 2.74 xERA was actually better than his ERA, and it was much better than 2023's 3.50 xERA. The fastball only sits 91.6 MPH, but it's an excellent pitch with a +5 Run Value and 22.3% whiff%. The slider is above average with a great .213 xwOBA, and he mixes in a sinker, changeup, and curve which were all really good pitches when he went to them. He has plus control over the entire arsenal, he induces weak contact with a 4.2% Barrel%, and he has above average K rates. There really isn't very much left to doubt, and seeing his continued lack of respect, he makes for a very reasonably priced target for a win now team. 2025 Projection: 13/3.31/1.15/168 in 168 IP

112) Ryan Pepiot - TBR, RHP, 27.7 - Pepiot was one of my top pitching targets headed into 2024, and he more than delivered with a 3.60 ERA and 26.3/8.9 K%/BB% in 130 IP. His 94.9 MPH fastball is straight elite with a 31.6% whiff% that ranks #1 overall among all starters. Kinda nuts. The changeup is his best secondary and what he was known for as a prospect, and while it wasn't dominant, it was still a good pitch that missed some bats (28.6% whiff%) and induced weak contact (87 MPH EV with a 5 degree launch). The slider was also a decent but not standout pitch that missed some bats (31.7% whiff%) and had a +3 run value on the season. He now has a 3.28 ERA in 208.1 career IP. Continued refinement to his secondaries and command can put him into near ace territory, but he looks like a strong #2 as is. He remains a target for me this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.48/1.14/176 in 160 IP

113) Bryan Woo - SEA, RHP, 25.2 - Woo had so much success dotting the corners with his 94.8 MPH fastball and 94.7 MPH sinker, that he barely had the need to go to any of his secondaries. He put up a 2.89 ERA with a 21.4/2.8 K%/BB% in 121.1 IP, and he has the 2.72 xERA and 4.8% Barrel% against to back up the dominance. The 4-seamer was near elite with a .276 xwOBA and 27.3% whiff%. He sinker was nearly elite too with a .271 xwOBA and 0 degree launch. It's not like he doesn't have secondaries that are effective, he just didn't need them. His sweeper was elite with a .109 xwOBA and 41.7% whiff% on 9.1% usage. The slider and changeup didn't miss a ton of bats, but they put up a .270 and .250 xwOBA, respectively. He can strikeout more guys if he wanted to, and he already put up a 25.1% K% in 87.2 MLB IP in 2023, so he's already established he's capable of more. Seattle loves their plus control pitchers though, and in that ballpark, why not throw the ball over the plate. There is some injury risk here as he got a late start to the season with an elbow injury, and 135.1 IP is a career high split between the minors and majors, but I don't want to discount him too much because of that. The elite control he displayed in 2024 gives him a high floor, and there is definitely more strikeout upside in the tank. I've loved Woo for awhile now, and I'll continue to love Woo. 2025 Projection: 13/3.43/1.09/154 in 160 IP

114) Adley Rutschman - BAL, C, 27.2 - It was announced that Baltimore is moving the left field fences back in after moving them out and making them taller before the 2022 season. Gotta love baseball where teams can just be like, yea, we are going to make our field smaller, or bigger, or whatever they hell they want. How fun if in football teams can just be like, so we're going to make our homefield 150 yards next year. Or 75 yards. Or if in basketball they can just make the rim 11 feet high. It's genuinely a cool thing that everything isn't so cookie cutter. And I respect Baltimore for realizing they overcorrected their fences originally and figuring out a happy medium. The Orioles had the 9th worst park for righty homers in 2024, so hopefully that number rises closer to the middle of the pack or higher. And with Adley Rutschman being a switch hitter who put up an 18.8 degree launch with a 42.1% Pull%, this is only going to help his lackluster homer totals. This is a nice bump for his fantasy value, which was starting to get quite boring. He hit .250 with 19 homers and 1 steal in 148 games. His OBP league owners were upset too with his 9.1% BB% (13.4% in 2023) and .318 OBP. He makes a ton of contact (17.1% whiff%), but he does it with a slow swing (69 MPH which is well below average), so he really hasn't done a ton of damage with an almost dead average Barrel% in his career. Moving the fences in is perfect for him, and while it might not be an explosion, 23 homers would be better than 19, along with the added BA, RBI and Runs that come with it. Everything seems setup for him to have a relatively big age 27 year old season. - 2025 Projection: 76/23/83/.265/.341/.445/2

115) Yainer Diaz - HOU, C, 26.7 - Diaz' launch went in the wrong direction in 2024, dropping from 11.5 to 8.5 degrees, and it tanked his Barrel% from 12.2% to 7.6%. He went from hitting 23 homers with a .538 SLG to 16 homers with a .441 SLG. He still hit the ball tremendously hard with a 90.2/94.5 MPH AVG/FB EV, and his contact rates hit a career best with a 17.3% K%, so he was still an excellent offense player, finishing as the 4th best catcher in fantasy. Lowering the launch and improving the contact rates also resulted in a career best .299 BA with a .295 xBA to back it up. He's a really good offensive catcher no matter where the launch lands, but for fantasy, it would be nice if he could bring that back up to 2023 levels, or even higher. He has a terrible plate approach with a 3.9% BB% and 42.6% Chase%, so certainly take a star away here for OBP leagues, but he's clearly proven he can make the profile work while he's in his physical prime. - 2025 Projection: 71/19/85/.287/.319/.461/1

116) Samuel Basallo - BAL, C/1B, 20.7 - Basallo didn't quite obliterate the upper minors like he did the lower minors, slashing .278/.341/.449 with 19 homers, 10 steals, and a 21.1/8.6 K%/BB% in 127 games, but when you take into account that he was 19 years old for the vast majority of the season, it gets a lot more impressive. He was also much better at Double-A with a 134 wRC+ in 106 games than he was at Triple-A (62 wRC+ with a 31.4% K% in 21 games), so I think we can give him a pass for an adjustment period with a new team, coaches, teammates, league, home park etc ... Even at Triple-A, the sweet lefty swinging, 6'4'' Basallo put up a 91.1 MPH EV. He's always put up solid contact rates in the minors, but the spike at Triple-A could also be an indicator that we shouldn't expect the highest BA at least early in his career. He puts the ball on the ground a decent amount, but with his type of double plus power, he's launch proof. I don't know where he fits in defensively with Adley behind the plate, and plenty of competition at 1B (Mayo and Mountcastle), but long term there seems to be plenty of room for all of them. He's a special power bat. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/35/.241/.300/.430/2 Prime Projection: 84/30/97/.268/.337/.505/6

117) Emmanuel Rodriguez - MIN, OF, 22.1 - You can't talk about Rodriguez without talking about the fact that the guy is rarely on the field. He played in only 47 games this year due to a nagging thumb injury, and he played in only 47 games in 2022 due to a meniscus tear (knee). He did get in a mostly full season in 2023 though (he missed a few weeks with an abdominal strain), and he got in a full rookie ball season in 2021, so I'm hesitant to officially slap the injury prone label on him. It's something to take into account to break a tie, but his upside is way too high to meaningfully move him down the rankings because of it. He's a power/speed/OBP beast with 9 homers, 9 steals, and a .459 OBP at mostly Double-A in 47 games. It was good for a 203 wRC+ at the level. He crushes the ball, he lifts it, and he's an excellent athlete who plays CF. Injuries aren't the only concern though, he also has strikeout problems with a 29.7% K%. Some of it is because of how patient he is, but definitely not all of it. I wouldn't say Minnesota's OF is wide open, but Jeff Zimmerman's latest article just talked about how they want to limit Buxton to like 100-110 games next year, and while they have solid options for their corner spots, they are far from locked down. If Rodriguez is healthy and producing at Triple-A, it might not be long before he gets the call to the majors, and there is potential for monster fantasy impact, especially in an OBP league. - 2025 Projection: 36/10/31/.224/.310/435/8 Prime Projection: 92/29/89/.248/.342/.490/24

118) Sebastian Walcott - TEX, SS, 19.1 - The 6'4'', uber athletic Walcott is the type of special talent where you can watch a few swings of his on Youtube as a 16 year old and immediately fall in love with him, which is exactly what happened when he was my #1 target from his international class. He's then been that rocket ship prospect you hope for, culminating with him putting up a 172 wRC+ at Double-A as an 18 year old ... granted it came in 5 games with a 29.2/4.2 K%/BB%, but I felt it would be more dramatic to leave that part out. And what he did at Double-A was more or less meaningless when he was already over 4 years younger than the average player at High-A, where he slashed .261/.342/.443 with 10 homers, 26 steals, and a 25.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 116 games. It was good for a 123 wRC+. It can be harder to evaluate players when they are so much younger than the level, but there was actually a similarly talented 18 year old at High-A all season with Walcott, Ethan Salas, and Salas put up a 75 wRC+ for comparison. The elite dynasty asset potential is clear with a potentially plus to double plus power/speed combo, but he's not quite there yet. The hit tool is still a risk and the K rates have been high at every stop. He also hasn't fully tapped into his raw power yet with relatively low flyball rates (although he pulls the ball over 50%). I wouldn't quite place him in the truly elite prospect tier, but he's in the one right under that. He's a Top 15 prospect. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 87/28/94/.263/.339/.484/24

119) Travis Bazzana - CLE, 2B, 22.7 - Selected 1st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bazzana looks like a tightly wound ball of kinetic energy that is just ready to explode in the box (I think ball of "Potential" energy is actually the correct scientific term, but I felt like "Kinetic" just hit harder :) ... There is toe tapping and bat wiggling before he absolutely uncoils on the baseball, jacking 28 homers in 60 games in the Pac 12 this year, and also smoking 6 homers with a 1.037 OPS in the wood bat cape cod league in 2023. He's "only" 6 feet tall, but there is easy plus power in here at the least. He combines the plus power with a near elite plate approach/hit tool (12.5%/25.7% K%/BB%), and speed (16 steals). He didn't standout in his pro debut, but he did enough to feel confident about him fulfilling his upside with 3 homers, 5 steals, a 126 wRC+ and 25.4/13.9 K%/BB% in 27 games at High-A. He's the total offensive package, and there is a reason he got taken #1 overall by a very smart franchise despite limited defensive value. The only thing that can stop him seems to be his parents. His parents almost ended his career before it started when celebrating. His dad tried to rip his arm out of his socket, and then his mom put him in some kind of neck hold into a tripping maneuver. Travis almost looked like he was about to square up with his mom for a second there. I guess they do things differently Down Under in Australia. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/31/.247/.319/.420/8 Prime Projection: 93/24/86/.275/.352/.466/25

120) JJ Wetherholt - STL, 2B, 22.7 - Selected 7th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Wetherholt might not have quite the ceiling of Bazzana, but even that is highly debatable, and he's establishing that he most probably has the floor edge with a 11.9% K% at Single-A vs. Bazzana's 25.4% K% at High-A. Different levels, but that is a pretty stark difference. He hit the ball on the ground a lot more than Bazzana, which is where some of that upside edge comes in, but he did it with a 91.9 MPH EV, so don't cap his power upside too much. He's two inches smaller than Bazzana at 5'10'', but he rocks that little man leg kick that I've always loved, and always seems to get the most out of smaller guys raw power. He slid in the draft a bit after getting a lot of #1 overall buzz, likely due to missing about half of the season with a hamstring injury and still not being fully healthy when he returned. It was his 2nd major hamstring injury within the year. His 16 homer pace was also not that impressive when everyone else was hitting like 30+. What he does better than maybe anyone else in the draft though is hit. He put up a 10.4%/18.3% K%/BB% in 2024 and had a 8.2% K% in 2023. He's a complete hitter who uses the entire field with a quick and simple lefty swing. Tack on plus speed (57 steals in 145 career games), and you have a damn enticing fantasy player even if his power upside doesn't quite match some of the other bats in the class. I have Bazzana ranked over him, but I don't think it's some no brainer decision. JJ is right there. - 2025 Projection: 18/3/16/.259/.321/.401/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/78/.289/.357/.449/23

121) Josue De Paula - LAD, OF, 19.10 - De Paula doesn't truly get the hype that Walker Jenkins, Sebastian Walcott and Leo De Vries gets, but he deserves every little bit of it. He might have the best hit/approach/power combo of all of them, putting up a 19.8/17.5 K%/BB% with a 130 wRC+ in 107 games split between Single-A and High-A. His game power still hasn't exploded, but it ticked up from 2023 with 10 homers (2 homers in 2023), and he hits the ball so hard at 6'3'' that there is little doubt about his power potential. He doesn't sell out for power, and his groundball and pull rates are fine, so he has the potential to be one of those special monster triple-slash middle of the order mashers. He's not a burner, but he went 27 for 30 on the bases, so the guy is obviously a good athlete who knows how to steal a base. He's not a good defensive player, but with his potentially elite bat, I'm not scared off by that. He won't get ranked as highly on real life lists as those aforementioned teenagers, but don't let you think that Josue isn't on that level. He's an elite  lower minors prospect. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/26/94/.276/.364/.482/14

122) Max Clark - DET, OF, 20.3 - Clark was the 3rd overall pick in a stacked 2023 draft class, and he played exactly as advertised in his first full season of pro ball, slashing .279/.372/.421 with 9 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.2/12.4 K%/BB% in 107 games split between Single-A (134 wRC+) and High-A (119 wRC+). He's an absolutely electric player when you watch him with a vicious lefty swing and plus speed. He's already one of the more exciting top of the order prospects in the lower minors, and when gains more power naturally, and starts lifting the ball a bit more (48% GB%), he can explode into a truly elite prospect. His hype has actually been relatively subdued considering how much pre draft hype he got, but make no mistake, Clark can be special. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 96/20/69/.277/.351/.443/30

123) Cody Bellinger - NYY, OF/1B, 29.9 - When you have a 90.6 MPH FB/LD EV with a 17.4 degree launch, you are going to be highly dependent on how juicy the baseballs are in any given season (I talked a lot about this last year, and I think nobody really knows how each season's baseballs are going to play exactly, including MLB executives, until they roll them out and see), and with the baseballs not being as juicy in 2024 as they were in 2023, Bellinger's homer totals dropped from 26 in 130 games in 2023 to 18 in 130 games in 2024. His Barrel% and FB EV were very close to identical, so it was as perfect of an example of the balls as can be. The good news is that his much improved contact rates from 2023 transferred completely with a 15.6% K%, so that helps both his BA and homer power play up. He didn't run much last year with only 9 steals in 11 attempts, but he's still fast with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint, so that is on the low end of expectations. And the best news of all is that he got traded to a ballpark that is perfect for his profile. He needs that Yankee Stadium short porch more than anyone. After such an insane start to his career, it is a bit underwhelming to see him settle in as a solid across the board contributor in his "prime" years, but with that short porch, it gives just a glimmer of hope that a big year could be in the cards if things fall right. 2025 Projection: 79/24/86/.266/.325/.450/14

124) Kodai Senga - NYM, RHP, 32.2 - Senga is a high risk, high reward win now pitcher which will test your fortitude on how much you like to gamble. I like to live dangerously (when it comes to fantasy anyway), and with how I build my teams, I need to take upside shots on guys like Senga to build up my rotation. So for me, he's a target, but this one depends on your risk tolerance. He didn't make his season debut until July 26th due to a shoulder injury, and then after that one start he went right back on the IL for the rest of the season with a calf injury that turned into a triceps injury. He returned for the postseason and the stuff was down with poor results. The thing I'm hanging my hat on though, is that in that one start in late July when he was perfectly healthy, the stuff was completely back, and he dominated, going 5.1 IP with 2 hits, 2 ER, and a 9/1 K/BB. I'm sure he felt a responsibility to help the team out when they got into the playoffs, so I'm not going to overreact to his stuff being down in the playoffs. With a full off-season to get healthy, he should be able to get back to the pitcher he was in 2023, which was a fantasy beast with a 2.98 ERA and 29.1/11.1 K%/BB% in 166.1 IP on the back of an elite forkball. Like I said, with how I like to build my teams, and my high tolerance for risk, Senga makes for a perfect target for me. 2025 Projection: 11/3.48/1.21/184 in 160 IP

125) Vinnie Pasquantino - KCR, 1B, 27.6 - As much as I want to keep calling for the big Vinnie breakout, and as enticing the contact/EV combo is, he now has 1,112 career PA with a slightly above average 7.6% Barrel%. It's actually declined every year of his career, so you can't even say it's headed in the right direction. His home ballpark is straight up death on lefty homers with a 68 HR Statcast Value. That HR Park factor is by far the worst for both lefty and righty splits (a 72 for Giants righties is next to last). While he crushes the ball with a 91 MPH EV, his FB/LD EV's haven't been nearly as impressive with a 92 MPH FB/LD EV in 2022, a 92.1 MPH mark in 2023, and finally a 93.7 MPH mark in 2024. That 2024 mark is his best yet, and he did close out his season by hitting 8 homers in his final 27 games before going down with a thumb injury that required surgery. If not for the injury, he was on pace to hit 20+ homers. If he played in a better ballpark for lefty homers, his 12.8% K%, 14.6 degree launch, and 47.2% Pull% might be capable of putting up some truly special seasons, but in the very worst park for lefty homers by far, it seems mid 20's is a fair expectation. And hopefully that thumb surgery doesn't keep popping up in 2025. 2025 Projection: 73/24/92/.269/.333/.455/1

126) Shane Baz - TBR, RHP, 25.10 - Baz returned from September 2022 Tommy John surgery in July 2024 (an oblique injury in spring delayed the start of his season), and while some things returned to prime form, some things didn't. The fastball was mostly back, sitting 95.7 MPH and was a plus pitch with a 47.9% usage, 22.1% whiff% and .320 xwOBA. The lesser used changeup was actually better than ever with a .251 xwOBA on 10.3% usage. And the control was mostly back too with an average 8.5% BB%, closing out the season with 4 one walk starts in a row. It's the breaking balls that didn't return fully, and while they were decent and mostly got the job done, they were not the bat missing, put away pitches that they were pre surgery. The slider notched a 21.4% whiff% and the curveball notched a 31.1% whiff%. It all led to a 3.06 ERA (3.57 xERA) with a 21.6/8.5 K%/BB% in 79.1 IP. Pretty good, but it's not the ace level upside he flashed pre surgery. Considering he missed 2 full calendar years, it's understandable that everything wasn't completely back in prime form, and with a normal off-season this year, I would assume that he's going to look even better in 2025. He laid a strong foundation himself in 2024, proving he was healthy and pitching well, and that ace explosion could still very well be coming in the near future if he can improve the breaking balls. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.55/1.18/142 in 145 IP

127) Jared Jones - PIT, RHP, 23.8 - Jones came out of the gate in 2024 looking like a completely refined ace with his control taking a huge step forward, putting up a 2.89 ERA with 30.6/3.4 K%/BB% in his first 53 IP, but he couldn't quite keep that up all season. In his final 68.2 IP he put up a 5.11 ERA (4.49 xFIP) with a 23.2/10.7 K%/BB%. He also suffered a lat strain (near the shoulder) in early July which kept him out for almost 2 months, but that was already 7 starts into his regression, so you can't blame the injury.  What he did in that 2nd part of the season was more in line with what I expected coming into the year. He has super high octane stuff with a 97.3 MPH fastball that notched a very strong 25.7% whiff%, to go along with a plus slider (37.3% whiff%) as his most used secondary. He also mixes in a below average curve and changeup. Below average control is what held him back from being a truly elite prospect last off-season, and while it looked like it was taking a huge step forward earlier in the year, he couldn't hold it. All told he put up a 4.14 ERA with a 26.2/7.7 K%/BB% in 121.2 IP. His 30.2% whiff% is elite. It was an extremely exciting rookie season that he should only build on in future years. If he can settle in at around average control for his career, he will be an easy fantasy ace. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.76/1.22/185 in 165 IP

128) Bubba Chandler - PIT, RHP, 22.7 - Just like with hitting prospects where there seems to be two camps between preferring the hit tool first, power later profile vs. power first, hit tool later, there is a similar split with pitching prospects which is pure stuff vs. refinement/command. Chandler most certainly fell into the pure stuff first category with his upside being obvious, but he had a lot of refinement needed with a 4.75 ERA and 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% 106 IP at High-A in 2023. And that refinement smacked upper minors hitters right in the face in 2024 with him exploding. He put up a 3.08 ERA with a 30.9/8.6 K%/BB% in 119.2 IP. He was even better at Triple-A than he was at Double-A. The fastball sits 96.8 MPH and notched a 30.5% whiff% at Triple-A. The changeup is his best secondary with a 83.6 MPH EV against and 41.2% whiff%. The slider is above average with a 85 MPH EV against and 29.4% whiff%. And the lesser used curve was a good pitch too. He also most certainly looks the part at a built up and athletic 6'2''. There is zero doubt that this is an elite pitching prospect with ace upside. He's not a completely finished product and he needs to continue to improve his command and refine his pitches, but he's shown he's more than capable of making those improvements in 2024. He could crack the Pirates rotation out of camp, and even if he doesn't, it won't be long before he gets the call. - 2025 Projection: 7/3.87/1.25/137 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.34/1.13/220 in 185 IP

129) Jackson Jobe - DET, RHP, 22.8 - I love Jobe. He's definitely an elite pitching prospect. But there are a few other truly elite pitching prospects in the minors right now (Painter, Schultz, Bubba, Kumar), and Jobe's 25.6/12.0 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP at mostly Double-A just isn't as impressive as theirs. It came with a 2.34 ERA, and the stuff is filthy with a 97 MPH plus fastball and 3 potentially plus secondaries in his sweeper, changeup, and cutter, so he's right there with all of them, he just doesn't hold down the top spot right now. Or the top 2. I have him 4th behind Painter, Schultz and Bubba, but there is no shame in that game as those guys are potentially true aces, just like Jobe is. Jobe should break camp with the team in 2025, and while I wouldn't expect an ace season right out of the gate, I'm betting on him getting there eventually. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.83/1.27/136 in 140 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.08/207 in 180 IP

130) Kumar Rocker - TEX, RHP, 25.4 - It's been a super bumpy ride, to say the least, but Rocker has inexplicably blasted off into elite pitching prospect status after just 48.1 IP this season. Well, it's not exactly inexplicable, it's explicable because he always had the nasty stuff to get here if he stayed healthy. Can we say pitching 48.1 IP is "staying" healthy? I don't know. But what I do know is that the high octane stuff is elite enough to take on that risk. The 4-seamer sits mid to upper 90's, and while it's not a huge bat missing weapon without tons of vertical break, he also throws a mid to upper 90's sinker which pounds the ball into the dirt. He can start throwing the sinker more, and he can also work on the movement profile of the 4-seamer now that he's healthy. The real money maker is the truly elite slider. It put up a 50% whiff% in 11.2 IP in the majors and a 71.4% whiff% in 10 IP at Triple-A. He rounds out the arsenal with a lesser used changeup, and how good he can get that pitch could be a big factor in just how high the upside will end up. Digging into the nitty gritty of his pitch mix is almost besides the point though, because staying healthy is essentially the only thing he needs to do. The Mets drafted him 10th overall and didn't sign him because they didn't like his medicals. He then underwent shoulder surgery shortly after that, but looked so good in Independent ball when he returned from the surgery, that the Rangers selected him 3rd overall the next year. Which he followed up with Tommy John in 2023, returning for the 2nd half of 2024, where he put up a 1.96 ERA with a 39.6/3.6 K%/BB% in 36.2 IP at mostly AA and AAA. It's about as risky of a health profile as it gets, but all pitchers are so risky, that I don't want to discount him too much because of it. I'll take on extra risk when the upside is a true ace. The downside could be a high leverage reliever though if he keeps getting hurt. 2025 Projection: 7/3.71/1.20/114 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.35/1.13/190 in 160 IP

131) Mason Miller - OAK, Closer, 26.7 - The Athletics made a compromise to keep Miller healthy by putting him in the bullpen, and he was so utterly dominant, it almost makes you tempted to wish they roll the dice on him in the rotation again. But my granddaddy always said you don't look a gift horse in the mouth (my granddaddy never said that, and I never called him granddaddy either), so let's be happy with the electric season he just put together. He had a 2.49 ERA with a 41.8/8/8.4 K%/BB% in 65 IP. His 41.8% K% led all of baseball with pitchers over 30 IP. His 100.9 MPH fastball was the fastest pitch in baseball. The slider put up a .141 xwOBA which was the top mark in baseball on sliders thrown more than 250 times (if you lower the threshold to 150 pitches, fellow Oakland reliever Michel Otanez holds first place, who is an interesting upside setup arm to target). Quite simply, he is the #1 dynasty relief pitcher in the game in any format. The only question is if Oakland will get the itch to put him back in the rotation, and while I would be scared to death, I would absolutely love it if they did. If not, the best reliever in baseball is not a bad consolation prize. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.59/0.94/100/33 saves in 65 IP

132) Alex Bregman - BOS, 3B, 31.0 - Bregman did his usual .260 BA with mid 20's homers and under 5 steals thing in 2024, and while Boston really isn't nearly as good of a park for him as Houston, he's not Isaac Paredes level dependent on ballpark. He still had an 89.1 MPH EV, which is really good, and he's been bringing his pull rates down over the last few years, sitting below 40% this year. He can be a really good hitter regardless of the ballpark, but he might trade in some homers for doubles in Boston. Boston is a great situation overall though, so his value does get a bump now that we know where he landed. The only thing different about his profile in 2024 was that his walk rate tanked with a 6.9% BB% (12.7% BB% in 2023), but it's such a one year outlier, you have to think that bounces back in 2025. It's a bit of a downgrade for his OBP value though. - 2025 Projection: 88/23/81/.264/.340/.440/4

133) Francisco Alvarez - NYM, C, 23.4 - Alvarez just went through an almost textbook sophomore slump season. He followed up his 25 homer rookie year in 123 games with a disappointing sophomore campaign, jacking out only 11 in 113 games, including the playoffs. The underlying stats back up the mediocre numbers with a 12.8% Barrel% in 2023 vs. a 6.7% in 2024, but the sophomore slump isn't about getting unlucky, it's about the game of adjustments. And even with the down power year, he actually put up a better wRC+ this year (102) than he did last year (97), so it was also about Alvarez working on becoming a more complete hitter himself. This is just the normal ebb and flow of a young player's career, and with Alvarez going through those growing pains as a 21-22 year old on the major league level, I'm not even the slightest bit concerned. His power can't be held down for long with a 114.8 MPH Max EV which was in the top 5% of the league, and his 88.8/94.2 MPH AVG/FB EV was still really good. He also made some incremental improvements to the contact rates, bringing the whiff% under 30% to 29.6%, to go along with a his solid 28.9% Chase%. Alvarez is still right on track to be one of the top hitting catchers in the game for the next decade. I'm smelling a big year 3 where he really puts it all together. - 2025 Projection: 48/16/62/.246/.323/.458/1 Update: Out 6-8 weeks after undergoing surgery for a hamate bone fracture. A hand injury impacted his power in 2024, and it looks like we could be headed for that again in 2025, but I'm not sure this should impact his dynasty value in a major way.

134) Mike Trout - LAA, OF, 33.8 - Trout's season ended on April 29th with a meniscus tear which required surgery. He tried to return later in the season, suffered a setback, and then underwent another meniscus surgery. It's unfortunately par for the course as Trout just can't stay healthy with calf, back, wrist and now the knee knocking him out for huge chunks of time over the last 4 years. The good news is that the Angels are finally going to move him off CF, using him in a corner or as a DH in an attempt to keep him healthy. Who knows if it will work, but at least it's something to hang your hat on. And most importantly, he keeps producing when he is on the field. He was the fastest player to 10 homers in 2024, and he even started running again with 6 steals in 29 games. His 17.1% Barrel%, 28.9 ft/sec sprint, .405 xwOBA and 21.4 K% are all right in line with his prime levels. And the clear indicator that he is still a beast is a 75.7 MPH swing that is truly elite. He's not likely to put up the BA and OBP he put up in his prime, but it sure seems like this guy could hit 40 homers in his sleep, assuming he can actually stay healthy. I think just about any name value has been squeezed out of Trout's value due to the constant injuries, so I see him as a fairly priced veteran power bat with injury risk. - 2025 Projection: 76/32/78/.268/.359/.515/5

135) Josh Lowe - TBR, OF, 27.2 - Lowe couldn't back up his 2023 breakout in 2024 with a .693 OPS in 106 games, but everything we loved coming into the season is still there. He put up a 90.8/94.3 MPH AVG/FB EV with a 16.9 degree launch, so hitting only 10 homers seems like the very, very bottom of his true talent level, and now moving into Steinbrenner Field (which supposedly has the same dimensions as Yankee Stadium), he's going to get a ballpark boost too. He's also an excellent base runner with 25 steals in 26 attempts. That is a special power/speed combo that is not easy to find. The hit tool is the problem of course, and while his K% jumped from 24.8% to 31.8%, his 31.8% whiff% basically remained the same, so I think he should settle somewhere in between those two numbers going forward. And he struggles vs lefties (.547 OPS), but he hit better against them in 2023, and even in some kind of platoon, his upside is high enough to not be too scared off by that. He's not without his flaws, but Lowe's power/speed combo is too special to sell low, and he's in fact a buy low for me this off-season. There is "league winning" (we all know one player can't win you your league) upside in here, and that is something I'm going after. - 2025 Projection: 77/21/74/.249/.313/.436/31

136) Cal Raleigh - SEA, C, 28.4 - Raleigh's 34 homers were a career high and was the top mark amongst catchers by a comfortable margin (Langeliers was 2nd with 29). His double plus 74.5 MPH swing and 21.2 degree launch shows he's not going to stop ripping dingers anytime soon, but it also shows he's not going to hit for a high BA anytime soon either. He hit .220 in 2024 and has a career .218 BA. You know exactly what you are getting with Raleigh. Extreme power with an extremely low BA. For OBP leagues, his 11.1% BB% was a career best, and while he's not going to be an asset in OBP, his .312 OBP at least won't tank you. He also stole a career high 6 bags (1 was his previous career), which is a nice little tack on. He was the 2nd best catcher in fantasy in 2024, and there is no reason he shouldn't be right up there again in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 72/31/90/.224/.310/.448/3

137) Chase Burns - CIN, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 2nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, dynasty managers owe a huge debt of gratitude to Cincinnati for going Burns over Condon. It would have made me legitimately sad to see Burns going to the Rockies. I know Cincinnati is no cake walk for pitchers themselves, but they just have a small ballpark, they don't have different air. And we've seen plenty of pitchers have excellent seasons in Cincy (Castillo, Gray, Greene, Lodolo), so I wouldn't let this landing spot move you off Burns at all. He has legit ace upside at a strong 6'3'', 210 pounds with a double plus fastball that sits in the upper 90's and a double plus slider that put up elite whiff rates. It led to a 2.70 ERA with a ridiculous 48.8%/7.7% K%/BB% in 100 IP in the ACC. He's inevitably going to get compared to Skenes, and Skenes put up a 1.69 ERA with a 45.2%/4.3% K%/BB% in 122.2 IP in the SEC. Skenes was in the tougher conference (although Burns pitched well in the SEC in 2022-23 before transferring to the ACC) with a better ERA, better walk rate and more IP. Burns isn't as good as Skenes, but not many pitchers are better than Skenes, so that isn't much of a knock. Burns also throws a curve and changeup to give him a legit starters pitch mix, and how well he can develop those pitches could dictate whether he becomes a true ace or a high K, #2/3 type. If your dynasty team is stacked with hitting, I don't think taking Burns #1 overall should be ruled out. The teams that took Skenes over Langford and Crews in 2024 aren't complaining too much right now. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.73/1.20/87 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.23/1.08/237 in 190 IP

138) Heliot Ramos - SFG, OF, 25.7 - When you dive into the bat tracking data, Ramos is one of the true standouts, if not the very top standout. Both his 75.2 MPH swing speed and 6.9 foot swing length are truly elite. Nobody is even close to as good at him in swing speed/length combo. The ones who are closest are Bobby Witt Jr., Wyatt Langford, Corbin Carroll, Colton Cowser, Lawrence Butler, and Brent Rooker. Not bad company, but again, he tops all of them. My point is, Ramos has a truly special bat. And his 2024 rookie year backed up that evaluation with a 120 wRC+, 14.5% Barrel% and 22 homers in 121 games. The sad part is, that isn't half as good as what he could have done if he didn't have San Francisco's horrific ballpark to deal with. He cracked 14 homers in 58 games on the road vs. only 8 homers in 63 games at home. If he played nearly anywhere else, I might have messed around and put him nearly in my Top 100. But he doesn't play anywhere else, and along with the ballpark, there are hit tool issues with a 26.1/7.7 K%/BB%. He also only stole 6 bags, but he has some speed with a 27.9 ft/sec sprint, he ran a bit more in his minor league career, and he only got caught stealing once, so I wouldn't rule out maybe some 15 steal seasons. Even with SF to contend with, I just can't overlook how special of a talent Ramos is. I'm targeting him despite the park. - 2025 Projection: 76/27/91/.264/.329/.473/11

139) Colton Cowser - BAL, OF, 25.0 - I wish Cowser ran more and/or was a better base stealer (9 for 13 on the bases in 153 games), because then I would really love his profile. He didn't run all that much in the upper minors either, and it doesn't seem like we can count on much more than the 10 steals range. The reason I want to see more steals is because he also doesn't have a good enough hit tool to be a positive contributor in that category. He hit .242 with a 30.7% K% and he had a pretty significantly high K% throughout his minor league career too. The last negative is that he doesn't hit lefties well, and while I don't think he's going to be a platoon player as he's good on defense and he should only improve against them, it's definitely something to note. But the trifecta of what he does well is a very powerful trifecta. He crushes the ball with a 13.6% Barrel%, 90.5/95.6 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13 degree launch, and 46.1% Hard Hit%. It led to 24 homers. He gets on base with a strong plate approach, putting up a 9.3% BB% and 25% Chase%. And he has well above average speed with a 28.2 ft/sec sprint. He's going to do damage, and if it came with more steals (or a better BA), you could really fall in love here, but because it doesn't, it caps his upside enough to not get too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/82/.253/.338/.472/11

140) Christian Walker - HOU, 1B, 34.0 - Christian Walker's real legacy will be to give every Quad-A, 1B masher hope that they too can become a perennial 30 homer, late career breakout bat, when the reality is that they probably won't be. But hey, you never know, it could happen (I'm looking at you, Luken Baker). As for Walker, he once again had an excellent season with a .351 xwOBA, 119 wRC+, and 26 homers in 130 games. His 75 MPH swing is straight elite, and with how much contact he generally makes, of course he's a beast. That is a special bat speed/contact combo. His strikeout rate did jump 4.9 percentage points to 24.1%, but his whiff rates were actually down a tad, so I don't see need to worry there. He's 34, and father time never loses, so every year is now a bit of a roll of the dice as to when the decline hits, but as of now, there are zero signs of decline. And signing with Houston gives him a perfect ballpark to do damage for the next few seasons. - 2025 Projection: 80/32/94/.250/.331/.485/4

141) Jake Burger - TEX, 1B/3B, 29.0 - Burger simply crushes baseballs with a near elite 74.7 MPH swing that produces big time exit velocities (91.3/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV). He doesn't do anything else particularly well, but as long as he makes enough contact (his 25.9% K% was a career best and it's been improving every year of his career), and gets on the field (I don't think Texas traded for him to sit him on the bench), he will be a major asset in our game of fantasy. He has a career BA of .251 in 1,344 PA, and as I laid out, his power is no joke. Burger deserves to be treated as a pretty coveted fantasy asset. Don't underrate him. - 2025 Projection: 73/32/89/.251/.308/.480/1

142) Emmanuel Clase - CLE, Closer, 27.0 - As usual, Clase finished well out in front of the pack in saves with 47, 2nd to only Ryan Helsley's 49, and 9 saves above 3rd place. Saves tend to be kinda variable, but not for Clase, it's a damn skill at this point. And I guess it doesn't hurt that the guy simply doesn't give up runs. He put up a 0.61 ERA in 74.1 IP in 2024, and he has a career 1.67 ERA in 312.2 IP. Come to think of it, not only does he rack up saves, he racks up innings. Most relievers are lucky to get over 60-65, while Clase has put up over 72.2 innings for the last 3 years. The 24.4% K% definitely hurts a bit, but honestly, with how great he is at everything else, I'm not sure it really matters. He's as elite as they come and is definitely a contender for top relief pitcher in the game regardless of format. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.31/0.93/67/43 saves in 72 IP

143) Zack Gelof - OAK, 2B, 25.5 - When I named Gelof a major target back in 2023 at the very beginning of his breakout, I dubbed myself the "Autobahn of Dynasty Baseball Schools," and if you think scraping up against the guard rails a little bit in 2024 is going to scare me off, you got another thing coming. I'm scooping up all of the depressed Gelof shares I can. The theme of the "Oakland" Team Report was the likely considerable ballpark upgrade that is coming for "Oakland" hitters, and Gelof is no exception with a .536 OPS at home vs. a .724 OPS on the road. A home ballpark upgrade is going to be huge for everyone on that team (other than the pitchers). Unfortunately, the ballpark isn't really Gelof's major concern, it's the hit tool, and there is no doubt that it is rough with a 34.4% K% and 36.4% whiff%, but the sophomore slump is very real after teams get an entire off-season to plan against you, and now it's Gelof's turn to make the proper adjustments to turn the tables again. I'm betting on him being able to do it well enough to allow his damn exciting power/speed combo to shine with a 89.2 MPH EV, 14.2 degree launch, and 28.7 ft/sec sprint. He went 17/25 in 138 games despite the .211 BA and .270 OBP. There is definitely a ton of risk that the hit tool doesn't bounce back, but if it does, he'll go 20/30 in his sleep. With his price in the toilet right now, that is worth the risk. - 2025 Projection: 77/23/75/.238/.313/.436/29

144) Bryce Eldridge - SFG, 1B, 20.5 - Let me just pump the brakes on Eldridge a little bit ... hold up ... don't kill me quite yet. I love Eldridge. He is so clearly a beastly power bat at 6'7'', 223 pounds with 23 homers in 116 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. But let me just bring up a few reasons why maybe not quite enough risk is being factored into his current humongous fantasy hype. For one, his hit tool is a legitimate risk with a 25.3% K%, and it was high in the AFL too with a 34.8% K% in 10 games. Sure he made it to the upper minors as a 19 year old, and while he didn't embarrass himself or anything, he didn't dominate either with only 1 homer in 17 games. His FB rates and launch are fine, but he's not exactly a launch machine. And lastly, San Francisco is death on lefty homers. Eldridge has the power to overcome that, so I'm not going too crazy there, but combined with the swing and miss and moderate launch, that is a trifecta of negatives which tells me to maybe have just a small amount of restraint here. Again, I love Eldridge. He's a special power bat. I just give this negatively tinted blurb relative to the monster hype he's already getting, and maybe something to at least keep in mind when you are dealing in trade talks involving him this off-season from either direction. - 2025 Projection: 29/10/36/.227/.301/.423/2 Prime Projection: 88/32/97/.258/.342/.495/6

145) Ezequiel Tovar - COL, SS, 23.8 - Tovar had a power breakout in his age 22 year old season, raising his launch 6.3 degrees to 18.9 degrees and raising his FB/LD EV 1.5 MPH to 93.1 MPH. It led to 26 homers in 157 games and he kept up the power output all season. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of improvement to go as his plate approach remained horrific (28.8/3.3 K%/BB%), and so did his base stealing (6 for 11). He's still just 23 years old, so I would assume the plate skills improve over time, and he was the 5th best defensive SS in baseball, so his glove will give him all the leash he needs to do that over the next few seasons. He plays in Coors which juices up everything, but especially BA, so even with a poor plate approach, he has a .260 career BA in 1.345 PA. If the stolen base skills were better, I can see hyping him pretty hard, but the power isn't monstrous, the base stealing isn't there, and there have been zero signs of plate approach improvement, so I can't get too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 85/25/81/.264/.309/.463/10

146) Colt Keith - DET, 2B, 23.8 - Keith's rookie year was so average across the board it almost makes it not average because of how average it was. It was uniquely average. He had an about average 97 wRC+ with an about average .313 xwOBA, an about average 23.2% whiff%, an about average 29.9% Chase%, and an about average 71.3 MPH swing.. Really all of his numbers are in that average range, slashing .260/.309/.380 with 13 homers, 7 steals, and a 19.8/6.5 K%/BB% in 148 games. His 87.8 MPH EV was a bit below average and his 27.7 ft/sec sprint was a bit above average. For a 22 year old, that is almost the textbook definition of "setting a solid foundation." He's right on track to be an at least above average MLB hitter, and there is ceiling for him to possibly become one of the better all around hitters in the game if he can take that same developmental path as Riley Greene did. - 2025 Projection: 72/19/76/.265/.324/.430/7 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.278/.342/.476/9

147) Marcelo Mayer - BOS, SS, 22.3 - Mayer was the 4th overall pick in the draft and just put up a 142 wRC+ in his age 21 year old season at Double-A, and the hype still feels so subdued on him. He might have to get used to that, because it seems like he's setting up for a Bryan Reynolds-like fantasy career. Really good, but not good enough for anyone to seemingly care to really gush over him. That 142 wRC+ came with only 8 homers and 13 steals in 77 games. He did it on the back of the hit tool with a .307 BA and 19.7/9.0 K%/BB%, but the .367 BABIP did some of that heavy lifting, and his strikeout rates have been on the high side throughout his career, so you can't really bank on a truly elite hit tool long term. His sweet lefty swing at 6'3'' is what got him drafted so highly, and that swing is still special with power and quickness, but it's geared more for all around hitting than pure homer power with a 47.4% GB% and 26.5% FB%. He's a good baserunner, but he's not a burner, so you can't count on huge steal totals either. Reynolds is really the perfect comp with his 162 game career averages of a .276 BA, .352 OBP, 25 homers and 8 steals. Maybe playing with Boston instead of Pittsburgh will garner him more hype in the long run, but fantasy wise, that equals a really good fantasy player who never quite reaches great levels. 2025 Projection: 28/8/33/.256/.318/.415/6 Prime Projection: 91/25/93/.276/.352/.470/11

148) Colt Emerson - SEA, SS, 19.8 - There is a case to be made that Emerson is overrated. He has high groundball rates and he doesn't pull the ball all that much, leading to only 4 homers in 70 games split between Single-A and High-A. It's also not a Jackson Merrill situation where the guy smashes the ball. Emerson can hit it hard, but he's not putting up gaudy EV's. He's also not a burner with average speed. So it's a hit tool first profile, and like many hit tool first profiles, the hit tool can start to take steps back against more advanced pitching, which is what happened this year. He put up a .263 BA on the season, and the 21.6/10.8 K%/BB% in 29 games at High-A isn't super impressive. A scenario where he ends up with a good, but not great hit tool, to go along with a moderate power/speed combo, definitely seems to be one possible outcome here. I'm only painting with a negative brush to start because I think it's more interesting. We know what a positive outcome can look like, which is that both the raw and game power ticks up over time, the plate skills remain plus to double plus, and the base stealing ability is legit (15 steals in 17 attempts). And keep in mind he was only 18 years old for most of the season. This is a high floor/high ceiling prospect in the mold of your Wander Franco's. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection:  99/22/72/.284/.362/.455/22

149) Christian Moore - LAA, 2B, 21.10 - Selected 8th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the Angels don't fuck around when it comes to promoting advanced college hitters to the majors, so you know Moore is going to be a contributor on your fantasy team real quick, possibly as soon as Opening Day. Shit, he almost made his MLB debut in 2024 with his absolute destruction of pro ball, slashing .322/.378/.533 with 5 homers, 2 steals, and a 29.6/8.2 K%/BB% in 23 games at Double-A. A knee injury (meniscus) is likely the only thing that stopped that from happening, but he returned to Double-A before the season ended and went 3 for 4 with a double and 4 RBI, so I wouldn't be worried about the knee. I fell in love with his personality during his Draft Day interview. It was the perfect mix of confident, cocky, thoughtful, playful and mature. That just seems like the type of infectious attitude I want on my team. He wasn't kidding when he said he had Champion in his blood. And of course, he was an absolute beast in the SEC, smashing 34 homers with a 1.248 OPS and 14.5%/11.3% K%/BB% in 72 games. He has a very strong righty swing at 6'1'', 210 pounds, producing at least plus power with average speed on the bases. In his freshman year in 2022, he put up a 1.062 OPS with 10 homers in 149 PA to give you an idea of the type of natural talent this is. As you saw with his K rate at Double-A, there are definitely some hit tool issues, which I'm not ignoring, but I'm also not letting it scare me off. I was high on Moore before his pro debut, and now I am over the moon for him. He ranked 4th overall on my End of Season Top 56 FYPD Rankings. - 2025 Projection: 70/23/77/.242/.310/.437/8 Prime Projection: 85/28/94/.260/.335/.481/10

150) Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - If you think Holliday had a bad MLB debut, get a load of this guy. Mayo was utterly lost at the dish with a .294 OPS and 47.8/8.7 K%/BB% in 46 PA. He had zero barrels with an 84.7 MPH EV and a 45.6% whiff%. It's a small sample, but I've seen a lot of poor debuts, and this one is up there with some of the worst, especially for a hyped up prospect. The debut was especially bad, but we've seen plenty of eventual studs have a terrible MLB debut. Just to use one example, Aaron Judge had a .179 BA with a 42.5% whiff% in his 95 PA debut (although it came with 4 homers and a .608 OPS), and he's been just fine. I don't want to put too much weight on the scary debut when Mayo has so many other things going him. His power is unquestionable at 6'5'', 230 pounds with 22 homers and a 90.7 MPH EV in 89 games at Triple-A. He swings a lightning quick bat with a double plus 74.1 MPH swing, and it's a relatively short swing too with a 7 foot length. His strikeout rates were also so much better in the minors with a 24.9% K% this year. He was getting sporadic playing time in the majors and doing a lot of pinch hitting, which is another reason to mostly ignore the MLB numbers. Is it in the back of my mind? Yea, I'm human. But I'm still treating him like an elite power hitting prospect. He currently doesn't have a starting job, so he's going to need injuries/ineffectiveness to open one up for him, or he's going to have to truly kick the door down. - 2025 Projection: 39/14/49/.225/.302/.435/3 Prime Projection: 84/33/98/.249/.336/.512/6

151) Jordan Walker - STL, OF, 22.10 - Walker is still just 22 years old. The Cards called him up so quickly it feels like he should be in his mid 20's by now, but I just want to reiterate how young he still is. And I want to reiterate that, because I now want to iterate what an insanely tremendous athlete he is. His 77.3 MPH swing is in truly rarified air. Elite of the elite. His 28.4 ft/sec sprint is firmly plus. He's 6'6'', 250 pounds. In no world am I giving up on this man when he is still just 22 years old. and not only that, he has an above average 104 wRC+ in 168 MLB games. Even with his terrible 2024, he smashed the ball with a 91.2 MPH EV and 9.5% Barrel%. He has some hit tool issues, but they really aren't all that bad as he's had respectable K rates basically his entire career being young for every level. There are some launch issues too, but like the K issues, they really aren't that bad with a 10 degree launch in the majors. This is an insane talent and his two biggest weaknesses aren't even that bad. And he's still 22 years old. St. Louis also announced they are going to give him a full leash in 2024 to figure it out. No way I'm giving up on him right now. Strong hold at the least, and buy at the best. 2025 Projection: 73/22/79/.246/.313/.431/9 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.263/.332/.471/12

152) Justin Crawford - PHI, OF, 21.3 - Crawford is just raw talenting his way through the minor leagues with elite bloodlines and elite talent an uber athletic 6'2'', 188 pounds. He slashed .313/.360/.444 with 9 homers, 42 steals, and an 18.7/6.4 K%/BB% in 110 games split between High-A and Double-A. He was even better at Double-A than he was at High-A with a 140 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed, he hits the ball hard, and he has a good feel to hit. It's pure talent baby, but if he doesn't start to refine his game, it will eventually catch up to him. He has an extreme 61% GB% and he chases a ton. Good defense and good pitchers, which he will find in the majors, are better able to take advantage of that than minor leaguers. But if he can start to refine his game, and at only 21 years old, I don't see why he wouldn't, watch the hell out. The upside is a legit elite dynasty asset, and while I wouldn't bet on him reaching that lofty ceiling, he can be a game changing fantasy player with even a moderately good outcome. I think there is too much focus on his deficiencies, and not enough focus on what he does well. I love him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 86/17/64/.273/.322/.420/39

153) Jaison Chourio - CLE, OF, 19.10 - Chourio gets plenty of love, but I'm not sure it's nearly enough. A lot of his love gets couched in "but he's not as good as his brother," which isn't quite fair, because I think there is near elite prospect upside in here, and he took steps towards that in 2024. His power didn't explode (yet), but it did tick up with 5 homers in 98 games at Single-A (1 homer was his previous career high). He's a still projectable 6'1'' with an explosive swing, so as he gains more raw power, and as he raises his launch (49.3% GB%), there could be a real power breakout coming down the line. And he has the elite plate skills (16.0/`19.9 K%/BB%) and speed (44 steals) to do the rest. He's yet to put up less than a 140 wRC+ at any stop of his career. This is easily a Top 30 fantasy prospect for me, and even that could be underselling him. If he gets lukewarm love in off-season prospect drafts where he's available, you need to jump all over that. Now is the time to target him aggressively. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 98/18/68/.276/.355/.433/34

154) Aidan Miller - PHI, SS, 20.10 - Miller wasn't a target for me in last year's FYPD class based on his perceived value/hype, but he proved the hype was warranted in his pro debut, obliterating Single-A with a 153 wRC+, and hitting well at the more age appropriate High-A, slashing .258/.353/.444 with 6 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.1/11.6 K%/BB% in 58 games. His big, quick and powerful righty swing was what everyone fell in love with originally, and he proved he can combine that with a good feel to hit, a good approach, and good athleticism. He can also play a decent SS, so his glove is likely to stick somewhere on the infield and potentially end up an asset as well. He's not exactly standout in any one area at the moment, but there is power upside in the bat which gives him the ceiling of a do everything, middle of the order masher. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.269/.342/.468/15

155) Jesus Made - MIL, SS, 17.11 - I love to see deep international prospects who cracked my Top 1,000 Rankings have big breakouts, and I thought my blurb for him last off-season was pretty interesting considering how things played out: "Stop me if you heard this one before, but the switch hitting Made is a projectable and toolsy 6’1”, 165 pounds with a swing geared towards launching the ball. He has a mature plate approach and he has the potential to be a very good defensive SS. I know these international prospect blurbs can get repetitive especially as we get deep into the class, but these are the prospects that can blow up if you want upside. Embrace the mystery. Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.258/.334/.449/12." And blow up Made did as one of the top breakouts in the DSL, slashing .331/.458/.554 with 6 homers, 28 steals, and a 13.0%/18.1% K%/BB% in 51 games. He's projectable, he's toolsy, he hits the ball hard, the plate approach is very strong, and he's a good SS. That is the total package, and while there is still a lot of risk as DSL performance is the least trustworthy, there is also truly elite prospect upside. I know there are many leagues, usually shallower ones, where gunning for the top pure upside is the best strategy to take, but even in medium to deeper leagues, Made is worth the risk. And use Made as a reminder to not be afraid to dive into the mystery that is the international class as you get deeper into first year player drafts this off-season. That is why the last third of my Top 132 FYPD Rankings are always jam packed with these guys. Low upside, boring college guys just aren't likely to be difference makers. Go for the lotto ticket. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.276/.352/.472/26

156) Steven Kwan - CLE, OF, 27.7 - Kwan's season perfectly encapsulated why I don't like going after hit tool first guys. He had a .389 BA in the first 50 games of the season, and then put up a .220 BA in his final 72 games. You are just way too much at the mercy of the BABIP gods. And the BABIP gods are fickle B's. He hit a career high 14 homers, and that is semi backed up by a career high 2.6% Barrel% and 14.9 degree launch, but that number is at the top end of his ability. And worst of all, he stole only 12 bases in 17 attempts. Everyone and their grandmother is running like wild these days, so you can't even count on him to be a true impact contributor in steals. It's not that I don't see the appeal of a profile like this, it's just that I'm never even close to the high guy on it, so I never roster these players in dynasty. - 2025 Projection: 90/11/50/.289/.365/.408/18

157) Will Smith - LAD, C, 30.0 - Smith always feels so underwhelming for fantasy, and now that we see he swings a double below average bat with a 67.9 MPH swing, it just feels like seeing that missing puzzle piece for it to all make sense now. The 10.8% Barrel% is excellent, and so is the 89.4 MPH EV, 18.7 degree launch and 19.3/9.4 K%/BB%, but that slow swing is just going to tamper down that upside. His career low by a decent margin 33.9% Pull% (37.7% in 2023) is also going to tamper down that fantasy upside. And at 30 years old, he's officially old for dynasty, especially for a catcher. There is certainly potential for everything to fall right and for him to have that big year, but I'm no longer waiting for it. He's a good fantasy catcher, but not a great one. - 2025 Projection: 75/23/75/.255/.342/.449/2

158) Garrett Mitchell - MIL, OF, 26.7 - The new Statcast Bat Tracking data has been such a fun and valuable tool to dive into, and one of the top names to jump out on that list is Garrett Mitchell. He swings an electric bat with a 75.7 MPH swing that is 27th fastest in baseball, and that is with players that have swung the bat even a single time. Bump the threshold up to 100 swings and he ranks 22nd. He combines the elite bat speed with an elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed which is in the top 5% of baseball. He's simply one of the most electric players in the game, and it unsurprisingly resulted in a very good season. He slashed .255/.342/.469 with 8 homers, 11 steals, and a 31.7/11.2 K%/BB% in 69 games. It was good for a 126 wRC+. Like many players who swing that fast, he misses a lot too with a 34.3% whiff%, but that has been headed in the right direction in his career, and he has a career 19.8% K% in 40 games at Triple-A, so I do think there is potential for that to continue to improve. He's also hitting .264 in 365 career MLB PA, so I don't think the hit tool is as risky as it seems. He hits the ball on the ground too much with a career 4.9 degree launch, but with his speed and hard hit ability, he can easily make that profile work (as he has been). I named him a major target at mid-season before he got called up to the majors, and I'll be naming him a target again this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 81/18/72/.248/.330/.447/26

159) Parker Meadows - DET, OF, 25.5 - If you would have told me that Meadows would put up a 111 wRC+ last off-season when I named him a major target, I would have assumed he was going to be a major hit for me, but we all know it wasn't quite that easy. He struggled hard in his first 32 games with a .096 BA, which resulted in him getting banished back to the minors. Depending on the league, many people probably dropped him or sold low by that time, and I sure as hell already given all my mea culpas and my bads on naming him a target. But he didn't hang his head when he got sent down, putting up a 130 wRC+ in 51 games, and then he carried that over when he got called back up to the majors, slashing .300/.344/.513 with 7 homers, 6 steals, and a 20.7/6.6 K%/BB% in his final 50 games (plus a 131 wRC+ with 3 steals and 1 homer in 7 playoff games). The same profile I loved last off-season is still present with a 18.6 degree launch, 29.3 ft/sec sprint, 27% whiff%, and 25.8% Chase%. He's also a plus CF. The one problem is that he doesn't hit the ball very hard. He had a 87/91.6 MPH AVG/LD EV with a 37.3% Hard Hit%. Even during his hot 2nd half he wasn't hitting the ball all that hard. It's a recipe for a low batting average, but the homer/steal combo has enough upside to make up for it. While it doesn't feel right to say Meadows was a hit in 2024, it also doesn't feel right to say he was a miss. I'll call it a draw, and we'll let 2025 break the tie, because I'm definitely still in on him. Let's run it back ... - 2025 Projection: 82/20/71/.248/.320/.432/23 Update: Nerve issue in his arm could land him on the IL, but he still hasn't ruled out Opening Day. Not going to make big moves on him yet as it seems like a non major injury, but I guess a nerve issue is never great

160) Kerry Carpenter - DET, OF, 27.7 - Carpenter was a major target for me last off-season, writing, "Carpenter has a pretty rare, very hard to find profile that can usually only be found at the top of drafts, but he gets valued like a boring afterthought. He had a 10.2% Barrel%, 90.1/95.1 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch, 28.1 ft/sec sprint, and 27% whiff%. I promise you, those are not easy numbers to find." ...  I knew that collection of skills was special, and then he went out and proved it in 2024 with a .385 xwOBA, .932 OPS, and 18 homers in 87 games. And the underlying numbers looked even better this year with a 17.7% Barrel%, 90.5/94.9 MPH AVG/FB EV, 17.6 degree launch, 27.7 ft/sec sprint, and 30.3% whiff%. That whiff% is higher than optimal, he was atrocious vs. lefties (.408 OPS in only 32 PA, meaning he was platooning), and he's not a good defensive player, so he has his warts, but I'll say it again, this is a very impressive hitting profile. Even in a platoon role, he could very easily hit 30+ bombs next year, and I'm not so sure his bat is going to get relegated to a strict platoon role. - 2025 Projection: 76/30/91/.262/.320/.506/5

161) Nick Kurtz - OAK, 1B, 22.1 - Selected 4th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Kurtz had one of the best pro debuts in his draft class with 4 homers in 7 games at Single-A, and a 129 wRC+ with a 20.0/13.3 K%/BB% in 5 games at Double-A. It was a just a continuation of the 3 years of dominance in the ACC. He's a large man at 6'5'', 240 pounds in the mold of a Jim Thome, country strong type. But he's not just brute strength, he has electric bat speed that led to 61 homers in 164 career games in college. He combines the at least plus power with an extremely patient plate approach and good feel to hit (16.2%/30% K%/BB%). He also has some sneaky athleticism, evidenced by a perfect 11 for 11 on the bases in his college career. The ceiling here is your classic complete hitting first baseman with power and patience. And it looks like the Athletics intend to fly him through the minors, so it might not even be crazy to see him break camp with the team, even if I wouldn't bet on that. The biggest downside is that his season ended on August 24th with a hamstring injury, and injuries have plagued him throughout his career, so I think it's something that has to be taken into account unfortunately. - 2025 Projection: 48/16/57/.247/.323/.439/4 Prime Projection: 87/28/93/.269/.357/.490/7

162) Felnin Celesten - SEA, SS, 19.7 - Celesten finally made his long awaited pro debut in 2024, and he didn't disappoint, slashing .352/.431/.568 with 3 homers, 5 steals, and a 19.4/12.5 K%/BB% in 32 games at stateside rookie ball. All of the explosive traits that made him such a hyped international prospect were fully present with an extremely athletic and powerful swing (particularly from the left side, but he dominated in 2024 with both swings) that already looks like an MLB swing. He's an explosive athlete in general with plus speed, so seeing the excellent plate skills from the jump in pro ball is a big deal. He does have two blemishes on his profile preventing him from ranking even higher than this though. It's the 2nd year in a row that an injury kept him out. A hamstring injury in 2023 wiped out his entire season, and a hamate injury that required surgery ended his season on July 23rd this year. The 2nd blemish is a 64.9% GB%, which is very extreme. Personally, I'm blinded by his extreme upside, and I'm apt to overlook the negatives. When a prospect has that type of upside, it almost never makes sense to trade them at this stage of their career. His value is pretty high right now, but I think he falls into the buy high range for me. Certainly don't trade him, and see if you can get him included in a trade without seeming like your frothing at the mouth for him too much, because it could give his owner second thoughts if you come on too strong. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.273/.344/.472/25

163) Konnor Griffin - PIT, OF, 18.11 - Selected 9th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Griffin has the highest pure upside in this entire draft. He's 6'4'', 215 pounds and has the look of a #1 overall pick in the NFL Draft as a QB. He has the neck of a football player too. He also has the athleticism of a football player with legit potential to put up 30/30 seasons with a plus to double plus power/speed combo. He's shown a good feel to hit with a good plate approach in his high school career, but like I mentioned back in February 2024 when I did a very early Top 10 FYPD Ranking, the swing isn't necessarily the smoothest thing in the world, although it actually looks much better to me now than it did then. Plus you can tack on electric bat speed and bank on continued refinement considering how young he is for the class. Pitt obviously wasn't worried enough about the hit tool to let him slip by them at #9, and for fantasy especially, I wouldn't let it scare you off him either. This is legit elite dynasty asset potential. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 89/25/92/.261/.337/.470/33

164) Cam Smith - HOU, 3B, 22.1 - Selected 14th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'3'', 224 pound Smith generates a tremendous amount of power with very little movement in his swing. It is quick, powerful and short to the ball. It is straight up one of the quietest swings from one of the biggest men I've ever seen. The swing is geared more for a line drive, all fields approach rather than pull and lift, which is why he didn't put up the gaudy homer totals as some of his other college hitting brethren with only 16 homers in 66 games in the ACC. But he has the raw power to make that profile work, and the upside is that it can come with a high BA. We saw what this profile can look like at it's best in his dominant pro debut, slashing .313/.396/.609 with 7 homers, 2 steals, and a 17.9/11.2 K%/BB% in 32 games split between Single-A, High-A, and Double-A. He put up a 122 wRC+ in 5 games at Double-A, so the profile was transferring to the upper minors, and he clearly had no problems ripping dingers to all fields with the wood bat. He very well might have the top hit/power combo in the FYPD class, and it's why Houston targeted him in the Kyle Tucker trade. The trade doesn't really change his value at all, but he will definitely get a nice ballpark upgrade even if he doesn't have the type of profile that necessarily needs it. - 2025 Projection: 62/16/67/.258/.322/.429/2 Prime Projection: 84/24/89/.273/.340/.466/4 Update: He's been a man possessed this spring and might just break camp with the team

165) Jac Caglianone - KCR, 1B, 22.2 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Caglianone's pro debut was on the disappointing side, and with how tightly packed the talent is in the FYPD Top 12, he's sliding down my rankings to the bottom of that Top 12 tier. He had hit tool and chase questions coming out of the draft, and hitting .241 with a 20.6/5.6 K%/BB% in his 29 game pro debut at High-A did nothing to quell those issues. He put up a lowly 94 wRC+ with 2 homers, which isn't what you want to see from an elite college bat in the lower minors. He then went to the AFL where the pitching was so bad this year, they are actively trying to figure out how to improve the pitchers in that league in future years, and he still couldn't dominate with a .749 OPS in 21 games. Tons of hitters were putting up just wacky numbers in that extreme offensive environment. He did jack 5 homers, and there is zero doubt about his massive power, so there is no doubt he has a carrying tool even if the hit tool and plate approach take time to adjust to pro pitching. He's built like an NFL tight end at 6'5'', 250 pounds, and he obliterated the SEC with 75 homers in 165 career games. It took him some time to improve his plate skills in college as well, making big improvements his junior year with a 8.2/18.4 K%/BB% (18.2/5.3 K%/BB% his sophomore year), so the hope is that he can do the same in the majors. KC's ballpark is death to lefty homers, and while I am factoring that in a bit, he has the type of power to not get too hung up on it. Even though the pro debut does have him sliding down the rankings a bit, it's almost more because of how much comparable college talent there is at the top of this class to begin with. He's still a very exciting power bat. 2025 Projection: 51/17/63/.232/.308/.449/4 Prime Projection: 81/31/92/.248/.329/.479/6  Update: Like Smith, he's been a man possessed this spring and deserved to slide up the rankings. The Top 11 FYPD prospects were already very close

166) Evan Carter - TEX, OF, 22.7 - Sometimes (or more like the vast majority of the time), general dynasty value and/or general dynasty rankings just isn't a great tool for how you should value players for your actual team. Take Evan Carter, who is certainly moving down rankings after an injured and down season, but if you were banking on him to be a core member of your future lineup, it doesn't make any sense at all to sell low right now. Even if there are real reasons to be worried, like having a bad back. His season ended on May 26th with a stress reaction in his back. It's his 2nd major back injury of his career as he suffered a stress fracture in his back in 2021 which kept him out for most of that season as well. He also didn't hit the ball nearly as hard in 2024 as he did in 2023 with a 86 MPH EV in 45 games. At a projectable 6'2'', 190 pounds, the hope was for him to add more power naturally as he got older, but the constant back injuries complicate that. Is he really going to want to add considerably more weight with a bad back? He also only attempted 2 steals in those 45 games, and again, with the bad back, is is possible he isn't really going to run a ton now? He deserves to take a tumble down the rankings, but back to my original point, it still doesn't make sense to sell low assuming you don't already have a stacked young hitting core. The back might fully heal, and at a still young 22 years old, he is in his prime healing age, so maybe that should be the expectation. The plate approach was still excellent even with the down year with an above average 23.4% whiff% and 18.5% Chase%. Maybe he ends up as more of a solid across the board type than truly impact across the board, but his trade value took such a big hit this year, that even if he doesn't hit his ceiling, you aren't going to get a fair return this year. Carter is a clear hold for me. 2025 Projection: 76/16/67/.249/.335/.410/15 Prime Projection: 91/22/72/.273/.361/.448/20

167) Adolis Garcia - TEX, OF, 32.1 - I'm getting a lot of questions from teams that are shopping Garcia this off-season, and the trade offers are in the toilet. If you own Garcia, you have probably identified him as someone you could move this off-season, but it makes zero sense to move him coming off this down season. He still hit the ball tremendously hard with a 91.0/95.5 MPH AVG/FB EV, and while the plate approach wasn't good with a 27.8/7.1 K%/BB%, it's never been good, so that is just part of his game. I definitely get wanting to sell him, because there are signs of real physical decline (his speed has declined for the 4th straight year with a now below average 26.8 ft/sec sprint), but it makes much more sense to wait for when he's (hopefully) raking during the season. He's "only" 32, and with how hard he hits the ball, he shouldn't fall off a cliff in 2025, so the smarter bet would be to wait to deal him, because the offers you are getting now are probably trash. - 2025 Projection: 79/30/93/.240/.306/.464/11

168) Randy Arozarena - SEA, OF, 30.1 - Seattle is where hitters go to die, and while Arozarena's 122 wRC+ with Seattle was actually better than the 109 wRC+ he put up with Tampa, the power/speed combo wasn't nearly as good with 5 homers and 4 steals in 54 games. You can't count on him for BA (.219 BA with a 26.1% K% in 2024), so with the game power upside now subdued in Seattle, it puts a cap on his upside. He's also a bad base stealer (20 for 30 in 2024) and is entering his 30's, so there is potential for that to fall off a cliff as well if he starts running less. He still hits the ball very hard with a 90.4 MPH EV and he gets on base with a 11.3% BB%, so he should still be a good fantasy player, but I'm starting to see more downside than upside. I wouldn't call him a sell, especially coming off the mediocre year, but I still think his perceived value is a bit higher than how I would value right now. 2025 Projection: 81/20/70/.247/.344/.429/19

169) Carlos Rodon - NYY, LHP, 32.4 - I feel like I nailed Rodon's evaluation last off-season, closing out his Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "If you’re a glass half full person, you can look at this as a lost season due to the injuries and expect him to bounce back in a big way in 2024, but if you’re a glass half empty person, you are looking at him like a ticking time bomb, especially with his injury history. I’m the type of person who looks at that glass and sees the water in the middle (I live in the gray), which is how I would value Rodon for next year." And that "in the middle" is basically what we got with a 3.96 ERA, 1.22 WHIP, and a 26.6/7.7 K%/BB% in 175 IP. I knew that explosiveness from true prime Rodon years was gone, but that didn't mean he still couldn't be a good pitcher, which is what he was in 2024. He has good velocity with a 95.1 MPH fastball, and his slider and changeup are whiff machines, leading to an elite 30.1% whiff% overall. And most importantly, he stayed healthy. There is still injury risk and he's getting up there in age, but there is also still upside with that whiff rate. I'll continue to split the difference with him and live in the gray. 2025 Projection: 12/3.73/1.23/191 in 165 IP

170) Sandy Alcantara - MIA, RHP, 29.7 - Alcantara underwent Tommy John surgery in early October 2023 and missed all of 2024. His excellent track record makes him a decent Tommy John discount candidate, but his lack of K's makes me hesitant to go too hard. Those lack of K's also caught up with him in 2023 with the worst year of his career, putting up a 4.14 ERA with a 19.8/6.3 K%/BB%. He was really a floor over upside ace with plus control, plus groundball rates, and plus velocity, but now there is risk coming off the injury. So he doesn't have big K upside, and there is also risk of rust/re-injury/diminished stuff coming off the injury. I think that warrants some restraint on buying the Tommy John discount too hard. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.70/1.22/158 in 175 IP

171) Tyler O’Neill - BAL, OF, 29.9 - O'Neill signed a 3 year, $49.5 million contract with Baltimore, and while his power could conquer any ballpark, those LF walls coming back in will only help. I thought Baltimore would prioritize pitching in free agency with how stacked their offensive minor league system is, but I can't argue with adding a bat like O'Neill, and it could open things up for them in the pitching trade market as well. Kjerstad must be sitting there and saying what do I have to do to get a shot. This signing definitely hurts Kjerstad's value right now, but you have to think he is prime trade bait, so I don't want to overreact. As for O'Neill, the man is going to hit dingers with 31 homers, a 17.3% Barrel%, 90.9/96.5 MPH AVG/FB EV, and a 20.2 degree launch in 113 games. His days of running seems to be over with only 4 steals, he's not going to hit for a high BA with a 33.6% K%, and he's been banged up his entire career, so games played are a concern as well. 2025 Projection: 75/30/81/.237/.321/.479/6

172) Lane Thomas - CLE, OF, 29.7 - The biggest question with Thomas is how much Cleveland is going to let him run. He stole 28 bags in 77 games with Washington and only 4 bags in 53 games with Cleveland. He's not the best base stealer in the world, he's alright at best, so that pretty stark contrast in steals is concerning for fantasy. And his hit tool, approach, and power are not quite good enough to really make up for that. He's average-ish in all of those areas give or take. I still like his collection of underlying skills with contact (23.3% whiff%), lack of Chase (22.9%), speed (29.3 ft/sec sprint), launch (17 degree launch), and hard hit (40.6%), so I think he's capable of some monster fantasy seasons (28/20 in 2023 and 15/32 in 2024), but if Cleveland doesn't let him run as much, the profile starts to look lacking, and he'll turn 30 during the 2025 season. - 2025 Projection: 76/20/76/.247/.313/.425/20

173) Tink Hence - STL, RHP, 22.8 - Tink is the forgotten about elite pitching prospect. He has injury/durability issues, but almost every pitching prospect has injury/durability risk, and I feel like it's really easy to start picking and choosing whose injury/durability issues you hand wave away, and whose you hyper focus on. Everyone has seemed to hyper focus on Hence's issues, where a guy like Painter can literally undergo Tommy John surgery and everyone is completely good with it, nothing to see here. Jobe, Schultz, and Rocker have all dealt with injuries and haven't racked up innings. But for Tink, his problems are like the main focus of his evaluation, and the main focus should be on his nasty stuff. Here is a twitter compilation video of Hence making hitters look absolutely silly with his changeup, both lefty and righty hitters. And that isn't even arguably his best secondary with a gyro slider and curve that he seems to have on a string, racking up strikeouts. He combines the 3 nasty secondaries with a mid 90's fastball that he can blow by hitters up in the zone with a good movement profile. It all led to a 2.71 ERA with a 34.1/8.1 K%/BB% in 79.2 IP. There is definitely injury as he's battled a variety of injuries in his professional career (shoulder, chest and lat issues with year), and he's not a particularly huge/broad guy, but they talk about him like he's 5 foot nothing, 150 pounds. The guy is 6'1'', 195 pounds. He's not that small. All pitchers have injury risk to me, so I'm not one to hyper focus on the injury risk. You know what you are getting into when you draft a pitching prospect, no matter how big and broad they are, they can all go down. I'm focused on Hence's true top of the rotation upside, and I feel like there is a bit of a buying opportunity right now. 2025 Projection: 4/3.89/1.30/78 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/186 in 168 IP

174) Emil Morales - LAD, SS, 18.6 - Morales was my 3rd ranked international prospect (behind only Leo and Paulino) and one of my top FYPD targets, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "His physicality in the box stands out immediately. He is a grown man at 6’3”, 180 pounds with a big righty swing that can punish a baseball. He combines that with a mature plate approach and a good feel to hit. It certainly looks like he can be a middle of the order beast, and he has the right team to get it out of him. He’s a definite target." ... and he more than came through as one of, if not the top DSL breakout, slashing .342/.478/.691 with 14 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.4/19.9 K%/BB% in 46 games. He's a lift and pull machine and there is potential for double plus raw power at peak, meaning the home run upside here is elite. The swing is quick and athletic, and he's a good athlete for his size too. Most places have Jesus Made over Emil Morales an easy call in Made's favor, but I actually think it's pretty damn close. Made has the hit tool and speed edge, but Morales has the game power and raw power edge, and often times that power edge can overcome all other flaws. A 22.4% K% is on the high side for the DSL, so I do agree that Made's combo of floor and upside takes it, but I'm not 100% sure I'm making the right call there. Either way, I love both, and I really, really love Morales compared to his much cheaper price. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 86/33/98/.250/.338/.519/9

175) Josh Hader - HOU, Closer, 31.0 - Hader is starting to creep up there in age. He's not old enough to start worrying about it, but it is something to keep in the back of your mind if you find yourself needing to kick start a mini rebuild or bridge year. Just saying that it could be the year to trade him at peak value if it makes sense for your team during the season. He's shown zero signs of decline with a 40.5% whiff% and a 2.72 xERA, so he should remain elite for several more years, but once you get that "old" label in dynasty, the trade offers get smaller and smaller, and I don't think anyone thinks of Hader as old right now. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.70/1.05/97/34 saves in 65 IP

176) Ryan Helsley - STL, Closer, 30.9 - Helsley stole the saves crown away from the 2 two time defending champ, Emmanuel Clase, notching 49 saves. He did it on the back of a 99.6 MPH fastball and an elite slider that notched a 51% whiff% and .206 xwOBA. The swing and miss is elite with a 36.1% whiff%, and while he's had bouts of wild control in the past, the walk rate was about average this year at 8.6%. It's his 3rd year in a row of being an elite reliever, so while he doesn't feel quite as established as the other elite options, he's just as locked in as an elite guy. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.56/1.08/84/36 saves in 65 IP

177) Devin Williams - NYY, Closer, 30.6 - Williams made his season debut in late July coming off a back injury, and it was clear very quickly that he was 100%. He closed out the season with a 1.25 ERA and 43.2/12.5 K%/BB% in 21.1 IP. He has a career 1.83 ERA with a 39.4% K% in 235.2 IP. He's as elite as they come. 2025 Projection: 4/2.51/1.04/89/33 saves in 60 IP

178) Edwin Diaz NYM, Closer, 30.11 - Diaz returned from a torn ACL that kept him out for all of 2023, and other than a small mid-season hiccup with a right shoulder impingement, he was mostly back to his dominant self. He put up a 3.52 ERA (2.48 xERA) with a 38.9/9.3 K%/BB% in 53.2 IP. The fastball sat 97.5 MPH and put up an elite 36.6% whiff%, and the slider is double plus with a .223 xwOBA and 39.4% whiff%. It does sometimes feel like he has a few more "hiccups" then he should, but that could also just be the inherent small sample nature of being a reliever. He's in the elite tier of the elite tier. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.98/1.01/98/31 saves in 60 IP

179) Sonny Gray - STL, RHP, 35.5 - Gray's career has been pretty wild. Trying to pin down his projections year to year is like a game of whack a mole. Just when you think you have a read on him, he puts up a completely different statistical profile. In 2024, he entered double plus to elite control territory with a career best 5.8% BB%, and it didn't come at the cost of his swing and miss at all, also putting up a career best 29.8% whiff%. It all resulted in a 3.84 ERA and 30.3/5.5 K%/BB% in 166.1 IP. The one area where throwing the ball over the plate so much did impact him was hard hit, as he put up a career worst 8.9% Barrel% against. It's why that elevated ERA isn't all bad luck (3.67 xERA). Who knows if he will still be this guy next year though, as his pitch mix really didn't change all that much from 2023, and he put up a 24.3/7.3 K%/BB% that year. At the end of the day, the statistical analysis on Gray is a fruitless endeavor. You are likely to get a #2 fantasy starter in some way, shape or form who is nearing the end of career at 35 years old. Really good win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.58/1.15/179 in 170 IP

180) Robbie Ray - SFG, LHP, 33.6 - I was a little hesitant to take the Tommy John discount on Ray considering his history of control problems and age, and while I was kinda right on the surface with him putting up a 4.70 ERA with a 11.6% BB%, and then hurting himself after 7 starts and missing all of September, I feel I was mostly wrong when you dig a little deeper. He was immediately back to being a K machine with a 33.3% K%, the 3.72 xERA looks much better than the ERA, the stuff has almost never looked better with a 94.1 MPH fastball (93.4 MPH in 2022), and the injury that ended his season was just a hamstring injury, which probably isn't that big of a deal. Even though taking the Tommy John discount didn't really pay off in 2024, it sure seems like it's going to pay off over the next few seasons. His value still doesn't seem that high right now, so you have another chance to get him at a slight discount this off-season too. He's a win now target. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.72/1.23/190 in 160 IP

181) Isaac Paredes - HOU, 3B, 26.1 - Here is what I wrote about Paredes in my End of Season Dynasty Rankings: "Trade to Chicago had bad news written all over it as he got a major ballpark downgrade for his hitting profile, and that has played out with a 86 wRC+ in 47 games since the trade. Chicago has Cam Smith and Matt Shaw in the wings, so I think it's very possible they flip him again this off-season." ... All is right with the world now that Chicago did the right thing and traded Paredes to a ballpark that fit his hitting style. And his hitting style is to often lift and pull lightly hit flyballs that barely clear a cheap left field wall. They say sports can mirror real life, so let's use Paredes as a good lesson to find an environment that best fits your skills, rather than trying to jam your skills somewhere that doesn't fit. He should get back to the hitter he was in Tampa with an about .250 BA, mid 20's homers, and almost zero speed. Add a star in OBP leagues as he consistently walks a ton. - 2025 Projection: 77/25/83/.247/.350/.448/1

182) Ian Happ - CHC, OF, 30.8 - Happ raised his launch to a 5 year high of 15.1 degrees, and it resulted in a career high 25 homers. He's always hit the ball very hard, so that bump in launch was just what the doctored ordered to give him that little bit of upside edge that he needed. He raised his launch every year over the last 5 years, so that gives hope this isn't a one year glitch. OBP leagues are where he really shines with a .341 OPB and 12.2% BB%, so in OBP leagues this is a damn good all category contributor, and easily a Top 100 dynasty asset, if not higher. The .243 BA and 25.6% K% holds his upside down a bit in 5x5 BA, but he's still really good in that format as well. 2025 Projection: 85/23/81/.251/.348/.443/11

183) Marcus Semien - TEX, 2B 34.7 - Semien is one of the top examples of a player with a slow bat still being able to thrive. There really aren't a ton of these examples, and even Semien's power has been all over the map throughout his career, ranging from the mid teens to the mid 40's. He has a double below average 68.3 MPH swing, and while maybe it got even slower this year due to aging, he's clearly always swung a slow bat, so I'm not blaming that on the down year (99 wRC+). All of the underlying numbers are more or less in line with career norms, so I do genuinely think it was just a down year, and not the start of a decline. Now having said that, the true start of the decline could easily come next year in his age 34 year old season, so you have to factor that into his dynasty value. He also stole only 8 bags in 159 games. If we can't count on steals, his career .255 BA, and variable power, might not really be able to make up for it. He's still a good win now player, but I think his name value is still higher than his true value in a dynasty league. I'm not looking to buy the decline years here. - 2025 Projection: 91/25/79/.250/.321/.450/12

184) Christian Yelich - MIL, OF, 33.4 - Just when we thought we were out of the woods, the damn back got Yelich again, undergoing season ending back surgery in August which put an end to a great season. He put up a 153 wRC+ with 11 homers and 22 steals in just 73 games. The .373 xwOBA and 28.5 ft/sec sprint backed up the surface stats. If not for the back injury, he was looking like a near elite win now piece, but I gotta say I'm scared off by the surgery. He's 33 years old and he's been dealing with a bad back for years now. I think his name value and great 2024 is going to keep his price very high, and in dynasty, I'm just not willing to pay that price with the back risk. 2025 Projection: 83/16/69/.274/.366/.439/20

185) Jhoan Duran - MIN, Closer, 27.3 - Duran is definitely the main closer in Minnesota, but they are not afraid to mix it up a little, so it does depress his saves totals a bit. He saved 23 games and had 7 holds in 54.1 IP. He missed the first month of the season with an oblique injury, so that played into the small save total too. Regardless of him losing some saves, he's an elite (or maybe more accurately near elite as there are some damn good closers these days) closer with an elite 100.5 MPH fastball that notched a 36.1% whiff%, to go along with an elite curveball and good splitter. It led to a 2.70 xERA (3.64 ERA) with a 28.9/6.6 K%/BB%. Because he loses enough save chances to make a dent in his totals, I would consider him in the low end of the first tier of closers. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.94/1.10/84/29 saves in 65 IP

186) Andres Munoz - SEA, Closer, 26.3 - Munoz only closed 22 games in 59.1 IP because Seattle was mixing and matching with him early in the season, and also because of a mid-season back injury that interrupted his season for a bit. Seattle does like to mix and match a bit, so it's possible his save totals won't be quite as high as the top guys in the league. He's pretty close to elite other than that though with a 2.12 ERA and 33.2/11.2 K%/BB%. The fastball sits 98.4 MPH, the slider is elite with a 48.5% whiff%, and the 97.5 MPH sinker is filthy with a negative 10 degree launch and 45% whiff%. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.78/1.10/83/30 saves in 62 IP

187) Matt Chapman - SFG, 3B, 31.11 - Chapman hit 9 homers at home and 18 homers on the road. Sorry to start his blurb off as a bummer, but his home ballpark is going to blunt any offensive upside he has. And he has considerable offensive upside with a 93.2 MPH EV and 16.2 degree launch. His 76.6 MPH swing was 6th best in baseball, so we are talking about a truly special power bat here. He's hit a lot of homers in his career, but I'm scratching my head as to how he hasn't hit even more. To his credit, Chapman took matters into his own hands and improved the areas of his game that were more ballpark proof, which was his baserunning (15 steals which was a career high by far), and contact (23.5% whiff% which was also a career high by far). He's always been fast with a 28.7 ft/sec sprint, so I don't see why he wouldn't keep on running at least somewhat. I've always been a bit higher than consensus on Chapman because of the huge EV's, but I'm always lower than consensus on SF hitters because of that terrible ballpark. So those two things cancel each other at and now puts me exactly at consensus for Chapman. - 2025 Projection: 89/28/81/.243/.330/.461/10

188) Jesus Luzardo - PHI, LHP, 27.6 - Luzardo was already one of my favorite bounce back calls for 2025, and after a good team like the Phillies just targeted him in a trade, I'm even more apt to go after him. His season ended in mid June with a lumbar stress reaction (back injury), but he already says he is 100%, and I doubt the Phillies trade for him if they were overly concerned about the injury. He was pitching terribly before going down with the injury with a 5.00 ERA and 21.2% K% in 66.2 IP, but he continued to show average to above average control (8% BB%), big velocity (95.2 MPH fastball), and two whiff machine secondaries (48% whiff% on the slider and 40.7% whiff% on the changeup). A 29.6% whiff% overall in elite. I'm not going to say he was purely unlucky, as the 4.55 xERA wasn't good either, but underlying skills and pitches still look near ace level to me. Or at least high K, mid rotation starter level, which is an excellent fantasy pitcher. People have legitimately completely dipped out on Luzardo, making him a great target this off-season. 2025 Projection: 12/3.68/1.21/176 in 160 IP

189) Taj Bradley - TBR, RHP, 24.1 - Bradley's stuff just gets hit too hard to truly put him in the young ace tier. He put up a 91.2 MPH EV with a 10.2% Barrel% against in 2024, and he basically did the exact same thing in 2023. That is 242.2 IP of getting hit really hard, so it's not an aberration. It's just part of his game. But even with him getting hit that hard, his stuff is explosive enough, and it misses enough bats, to still result in a very good season. He put up a 4.11 ERA with a 1.22 WHIP and 26.6/8.1 K%/BB% in 138 IP. The fastball sits 96.4 MPH and put up a respectable 21% whiff%. The splitter (33% whiff%) and cutter (32.4% whiff%) are both above average to plus pitches, and he throws a lesser used curve that missed bats too (34.6% whiff%). It resulted in a well above average 27.4% whiff%. Improving his command is probably his best hope to bring that Barrel% down in the future, and at only 24 years old, that is more than possible. And if anyone can help him figure it out, it's Tampa. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.76/1.20/173 in 160 IP

190) Gavin Williams - CLE, RHP, 25.8 - Williams might be in a very nice buy low pocket of his career right now. He started the season on the IL with elbow discomfort, and it seemed like he could never really find that groove after debuting in early July. He put up a 4.86 ERA with a 23.8/9.6 K%/BB% in 76 IP, but the 4.14 xERA shows he got unlucky, and the fastball velocity was actually up a tick to 96.6 MPH. His curve and cutter both missed bats (30.4% whiff% and 34.1% whiff%) and put up solid xwOBA's (.241 and .277). None of his pitches are truly dominant and the control is below average, so this isn't a case where a big breakout is a foregone conclusion. He definitely needs to make improvements this off-season to his arsenal and command, but the raw ingredients and talent are in there to do that. He could be a reasonably priced target for a team in any part of the contention cycle (win now, rebuild, retool, stuck in the middle etc ...), but I would be careful about overpaying, as he still has good name value from his strong rookie year. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.79/1.28/160 in 150 IP Update: Looks good in spring and gets a bump, but I would still be careful about going too crazy here

191) Bo Bichette - TOR, SS, 27.1 - Bichette is very clearly going to bounce back from a horrendous 2024 where he put up a career worst by a mile .598 OPS. He has a career .798 OPS, he's never had an OPS below .802 before this season, and he's going to be 27 years old. There is no way that he isn't going to bounce back, the only question, is how high will the bounce be, and I don't think it will be high enough to warrant his still pretty high name value price. His 70.4 MPH swing is below average and so is his 27.3 ft/sec sprint. We really aren't talking about a truly electric athlete right now. The 19% K% is above average, but it's not off the charts or anything, the plate approach is bad with a 6% BB% and 37.1% Chase%, the launch is low at 7.2 degrees, and the pull is super low at 28.1%. All of those low marks have been consistent throughout his career (other than the bat speed which we don't have data on), so you can't write that stuff off due to the down season. He's only stolen 10 bags in his last 216 games, so you can't count on big contributions there either. The main thing he has going for him is that he hits the ball hard, but that bottomed out in 2024 with a 4.4% Barrel% and 92.3 MPH FB EV. Just based purely on track record and age, he almost has to bounce back, but I don't see the upside to really bet on it considering his current price (145 NFBC ADP). I'm not buying. - 2025 Projection: 76/18/79/.274/.318/.438/9

192) Gerrit Cole - NYY, RHP, 34.7 - I was slightly low on Cole in 2024, closing out his Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "there are some indications he might be coming back to the pack a bit," and then shortly after that he got hit with nerve inflammation and edema in his elbow, which delayed the start of his season until mid June. It resulted in the worst season he's had since his breakout with a 3.41 ERA and 25.5/7.4 K%/BB% in 95 IP. He also put up a lowly 17.7/8.1 K%/BB% in 29 innings in the playoffs (albeit with a 2.17 ERA). I think it's fair to say that the days of elite Cole are likely gone, although maybe you can say a full off-season to get healthy will produce a bounce back season. The 95.9 MPH fastball was a career low and his secondaries are starting to become pretty unimpressive. His secondaries used to be whiff machines, but that took a big step back in 2023, and then it took another step back this year with his overall whiff% down to a slightly below average 24.8%. He's had below average Barrels against for years now, so he's not an inducing weak contact guy, and his control took a step back this year as well. For sure you have to factor in some health bounce back, but he took a step back in 2023 when he was healthy, so I'm not sure how much to factor in. He's still a reliable vet who should produce near ace production, but it seems his days of being a tippy top dynasty asset are over. - 2025 Projection: OUT Update: Underwent Tommy John surgery which could keep him out until mid-season 2026 depending on rehab schedule. That means he will be almost 36 years old when he returns, and he was already on the decline. His value takes a big hit

193) Nick Lodolo - CIN, LHP, 27.2 - The Eternal Buy Low is back at it again. It wouldn't be a dynasty baseball off-season without Nick Lodolo being a buy low candidate. I imagine that one day I will be in my 80's, and I will be writing about how Nick Lodolo Jr. is a great buy low candidate. Like father, like son (or maybe like grandfather, like grandson at that point). But back to this present timeline, it really is the same old story, different details. Lodolo missed time this year with a groin injury and finger injury, but neither are to his arm, so it's not as concerning long term even if these non arm injuries are starting to pile up. He also underperformed his underlying numbers with a 4.76 ERA vs. 3.78 xERA in 115.1 IP. The K% dropped a bit this year with a 24.7/7.5 K%/BB%, but the stuff is still excellent, so I'm also not overly concerned with that. He has a 94.1 MPH fastball that put up a respectable .323 xwOBA and 23% whiff%. The curveball is plus to double plus with a .233 xwOBA and 42.5% whiff%. He also throws a decent changeup and sinker, giving him a legit 4 pitch mix. The control is average or maybe even above. It's been a frustrating start to his career because we all know there is so much more in here, but I'm not letting that frustration get to me. Certainly do not sell low on this man, and once again, target him. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.73/1.22/166 in 150 IP

194) Brandon Pfaadt - ARI, RHP, 26.6 - I would say Pfaadt is a major dynasty buy with a 4.71 ERA vs. 3.78 xERA in 181.2 IP, but I feel like he's too easy to identify as a "buy low," making him not a buy low. I think he's getting fairly priced as it's obvious he got unlucky in 2024. xERA actually likes him the least out of every ERA estimator, so FIP-heads or SIERA fiends will be all over him. He has a bat missing 93.8 MPH fastball (22.4% whiff%), a groundball inducing 93.7 MPH sinker (negative one degree launch), three bat missing secondaries (the sweeper leads the way with a 36.2% whiff%), double plus control with a 24.3/5.5 K%/BB%, and a great track record of health. I'm definitely buying and would be all over any discount, but I'm not so sure there is going to be a big discount in most leagues. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.71/1.19/178 in 175 IP

195) Logan O’Hoppe - LAA, C, 25.2 - O'Hoppe was unsurprisingly not able to keep up his insane homer pace from 2023, but he locked himself in as a legit power hitter with 20 homers, a 12% Barrel%, 90.4/95.4 MPH AVG/FB EV and a 15.3 degree launch in 136 games. Unfortunately, he also locked in that he isn't going to hit for a high average or OBP with a 29.7/6.3 K%/BB%, backed up by a 33.6% whiff% and 34% Chase%. I'm betting on him being able to improve the hit tool and plate approach somewhat as he gains more experience (remember that it can take catchers longer to develop offensively with how much focus they put on defense/pitching), which could set him up for some big seasons considering those underlying power metrics. The little thorn is that Travis d'Arnaud just signed a 2 year deal, which is almost certainly going to cut into O'Hoppe's playing time. - 2025 Projection: 66/24/75/.249/.317/.446/2

196) Willson Contreras - STL, C, 32.11 - It was announced that Contreras will be moved to 1B, so you are on a one year notice to figure out your catcher spot for 2026 and beyond if you own Contreras. Maybe that plan can entail going over his replacement, Ivan Herrera, but we'll get to him later. The good news is that you should at the least get a boost in playing time at your catcher position for 2025, and maybe even a production boost without him having to take a beating behind the plate. He also has the bat to profile at 1B with his 3rd straight season of putting up an xwOBA that was in the top 7% of baseball (.365 xwOBA in 2024). His 75.9 MPH swing is elite, just to give you another idea of how legit his bat is, and he crushes the ball with a 91.6 MPH EV and 11.2% Barrel%. The only negative of his profile is that he swings and misses a lot with a 35% whiff%, and while that is a career worst, it's really not far off at all from his career norms, so I wouldn't be worried about his BA (career .258 BA). He's getting up there in age, but for 2025, he has a shot to outdo his younger brother for the top fantasy catcher in the game. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/86/.255/.350/.470/5

197) Felix Bautista - BAL, Closer, 29.9 - Bautista underwent Tommy John surgery in October of 2023, and all signs seem to point to a smooth recovery process, so he should be good to go for 2025. If he is legitimately fully healthy, there is zero doubt that he is the elite of the elite with a 1.48 ERA and 46.4/11.0 K%/BB% in 61 IP in 2023. The 99.5 MPH fastball notched a 37.8% whiff% and the splitter was untouchable with a 60.2% whiff% and .113 xwOBA. As we've seen with pitchers coming back from Tommy John though, it is not a guarantee that they are actually 100% healthy. Sometimes everything is back but the control. Sometimes everything is back but the secondaries. Sometimes the velocity is a bit down. Sometimes there are setbacks. On a general dynasty ranking, I think factoring in some of that risk is the right play, but for your personal dynasty team, if you want to just assume he will be fully healthy and elite, I have no problem with that. He was also so insanely good, that if he takes a step back, he could still be the best closer in baseball. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.95/0.98/88/32 saves in 60 IP

198) Nico Hoerner - CHC, 2B, 27.11 - Hoerner is a super simple evaluation as an elite contact/speed/defense play with a 10.3% K% and 31 steals in 151 games. He graded out as the 3rd best defensive 2B in baseball behind only Marcus Semien and Andres Gimenez. There isn't much power here and there isn't much coming either with a 1.2% Barrel% (that is 6 total barrels all season), leading to only 7 homers. The Paredes/Cam Smith trade seems to take some of the trade heat off Hoerner for now pending future moves, but he's a starter no matter where he lands. - 2025 Projection: 83/8/50/.280/.339/.389/30

199) Bryson Stott - PHI, 2B, 27.6 - I always thought Stott had the possibility of another level of power to unleash considering his size (6'3'', 200 pounds), and decent EV data (88.1 MPH in 2023), but now seeing his double below average 68.2 MPH swing, I realize that it wasn't actually a very good possibility. I know I've said it in a ton of player blurbs already, but this new bat speed data is so awesome to have. If the bat speed data didn't tell me that more power wasn't coming, his 2024 numbers would have told me anyway with his EV hitting a career low 87 MPH, leading to only 11 homers in 148 games. The contact was still excellent (16.3% K%), the speed was on point (32 steals with a 29.1 ft/sec sprint), and the 9.3% BB% was a career best. I'm no longer holding out hope for a breakout (although you still never know), but his contact/speed profile is still enticing. - 2025 Projection: 79/15/65/.268/.327/.407/31

200) Clarke Schmidt - NYY, RHP, 29.1 - Schmidt's breakout/leveling up has slid just far enough under the radar to land in a perfect target range, although without a current lock on a rotation spot, it's kinda hard to go all in on him as a target. He put up a 2.85 ERA with a 26.3/8.5 K%/BB% in 85.1 IP, and while he certainly got lucky with a 3.78 xERA, I think that xERA is underselling him too. Let's start with the fact he had a 29.4% whiff% overall, which should immediately get your attention. The cutter he added in 2023 has leveled up into a plus pitch with a 32.2% whiff%, which he combines with an above average to plus sweeper (.269 xwOBA with a 29.7% whiff%), and plus to double plus curve (.217 xwOBA with a 33% whiff%). The 94.3 MPH sinker also missed the most bats of it's career with a 20.3% whiff%. He had about average control last year and he's had average to above average control in his career, so there are zero issues there. He doesn't get hit particularly hard either with an above average 5.9% Barrel%. That is just a really, really strong overall skillset, and at the least it should result in a good fantasy starter. At the most, there is legit #2 starter potential in here. Like all pitchers, injuries are a concern, and he did miss over 3 months mid-season with a lat strain. He wasn't quite as good when he returned in September, so that is probably a major reason his price is a bit depressed, but I'll just use that as a buying opportunity. I can't in good conscious go all in on a possible 6th starter, but if he had a rotation spot, he would rank considerably higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.58/1.19/169 in 160 IP Udpate: Injuries have secured Schmidt's spot in the rotation and is back to being a very fairly priced high floor/high upside target

201) Reese Olson - DET, RHP, 25.8 - Olson's 21.7/7.1 K%/BB% in 112.1 IP (a shoulder injury interrupted his season, but he was 100% when he returned in September) was not all that impressive, but his surface stats, underlying numbers, and individual pitch data was all pretty impressive to me, which makes me override my usual K/BB is king stance. He put up a 3.53 ERA with a 1.18 WHIP. The 3.64 xERA backs up the ERA. The K% is also deceptively low with a 28.7% whiff% which is double plus and nearing on elite. His slider is a double plus pitch with a 45.5% whiff%, and the changeup is plus too with a 42.9% whiff%. The 94.2 MPH 4-seamer isn't good, but the 94.2 sinker is with a +6 Run Value that was 37th best in baseball. He can keep the ball on the ground (50.6% GB%), he can miss bats, and the control is above average and bordering on plus. He's a really good young starter, and with a 270 NFBC ADP, he's definitely underrated. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.69/1.20/153 in 150 IP

202) Shea Langeliers - OAK, C, 27.5 - Langeliers' 29 homers was 2nd in baseball for catchers behind only Cal Raleigh, and he's about to get a major ballpark upgrade in 2025. He will certainly compete at the top of that category again because he absolutely smashes the ball with a 91.3/95.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, and he launches it with a 16.3 degree launch. It's going to come with a low batting average (27.2/7.7 K%/BB%), but that is just the game with the vast majority of catchers. He's a perfect example of it taking catchers a bit longer to develop offensively after getting taken 9th overall in 2019, but he's arrived. - 2025 Projection: 64/26/78/.237/.306/.447/3

203) Alec Bohm - PHI, 3B, 28.8 - There is a reason why I am locked in on power/speed upside when targeting minor league players, rather than the better in real life, low launch line drive hitters, because even when they completely pan out, like Alec Bohm, it just makes for such a boring fantasy player. He put up a career best (other than his smaller sample rookie year) 115 wRC+ with a .280 BA, and it still resulted in him finishing 84th on the Razzball Player Rater. He hit 15 homers with 5 steals and 159 combined RBI/Runs. It just isn't hard production to replace, maybe except the BA, but if I'm going to make a BA play, they better steal a bunch of bases too. Even when a player like this works out, they still make for a kinda awkward fit on my roster with how I like to build my teams. They just aren't my type of players. - 2025 Projection: 75/18/92/.278/.330/.445/5

204) Michael Busch – CHC, 1B, 27.4 – Busch is a mixed bag of things you really want to buy into, and things that make you hesitant to buy in too hard. On the positive side, his 11.2% Barrel%, 89.9/95.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, and 17.2 degree launch makes you think he can truly be a preeminent power hitter in this game. But those numbers only resulted in 21 homers in 152 games last year, and his expected homer totals were right in that area too, so he wasn’t really unlucky there. His below average 70.3 MPH swing it really the thing that makes me hesitant to start projecting perennial 30+ homer seasons. The true top power hitters in the game generally swing a much, much quicker bat, and while that bat speed doesn’t preclude him from hitting 30+, I think it does make mid 20 homer projections more reasonable moving forward, which would make him a good fantasy first baseman, but not a truly great one. And of course the most obvious downside is the swing and miss with a 28.6% K%, leading to a .248 BA and .217 xBA. I’m not expecting his BA to bottom out, but I think the risk is there. Add a star in OBP leagues as his plate approach is excellent with a 11.1% BB% and well above average 23.2% Chase%. 2025 Projection: 77/25/83/.244/.330/.458/2

205) Michael Toglia - COL, 1B/OF, 26.8 - Tyler Soderstrom is my 2024 version of Mark Vientos, because Vientos "came out of nowhere" and Soderstrom fits that a bit better, but Toglia is most definitely one of my top power bat targets for 2025. He put up a 17.3% Barrel% in 116 games. I mean, I could honestly end the blurb right there. Go get this man ... but I'll continue. His 92.1/95.7 MPH AVG/FB EV is beastly, which he combines with a 15.1 degree launch. He swings a quick bat with a 73.2 MPH swing, and it's not very long either at 7.5 feet. The hit tool is definitely an issue with a 32.1% K%, 34.9% whiff%, and .218 BA, but Coors Field will give him all the help he can get there, and his .244 xBA isn't bat at all. The hit tool risk is also fully factored into his current price, and I would argue overly factored in. He also stole 10 bags in 11 attempts (in only 116 games), which is an nice little bonus to offset the low BA. And in OBP leagues he's an even bigger target with an 11.8% BB%. I'm willing to take on the batting average risk when the power upside is so high. I'm going after Toglia. 2025 Projection: 77/31/89/.232/.320/.475/9

206) Dansby Swanson - CHC, SS, 31.2 - Swanson had a bit of a down year with a .701 OPS, but it's just the normal ebb and flow of a career. His true talent level remains the same. His .321 xwOBA was better than the .307 wOBA, and he was excellent in the 2nd half, slashing .288/.353/.452 with 8 homers, 14 steals, and a 19.8/9.4 K%/BB% in his final 68 games. He doesn't standout in any one category, but he can make a true impact in all of them. - 2025 Projection: 84/23/82/.250/.323/.431/17

207) Masyn Winn - STL, SS, 23.0 - Winn stole only 11 bags in 16 attempts, which is definitely a bit concerning for his type of profile. He was a very good and successful base stealer in the minors, and he has legit double plus speed, but both his attempts and success rate plummeted in the majors over the last two years. He's still just 23 years old, so I definitely expect improvement there, but it's hard to just assume he becomes a true perennial 30+ guy, let alone a 20+ guy. The good news is that while he currently has a hit/speed profile, there is real potential for him to add power. He cracked 15 homers with a 13.2 degree launch and 87 MPH EV in 150 games. There is definitely room for him to add on more raw power, and he also has the ability to pull the ball more to get to that raw power. The 89.3 MPH FB EV and below average 70.2 MPH swing gives me some pause to project too many power gains here, but considering he just hit 15 in his age 22 year old season, I don't see why 20 would be out of the question at peak. My gut tells me he stays a mostly hit/speed player throughout his career, or a moderate across the board type a la the guy ranked right below him (Jeremy Pena), but I do see the upside for another level. - 2025 Projection: 84/16/62/.266/.317/.415/18

208) Jeremy Pena - HOU, SS, 27.6 - Pena was already 24 years old when he broke into the bigs in 2022, and it turns out he was more or less an already finished product. He put up a .304 xwOBA in 2022, a .310 xwOBA in 2023, and a .310 xwOBA in 2024. He gets the bat on the ball, he hits it hard enough, and while he's lightning fast, he's only an average to above average base stealer. It all adds up to a solid but unspectacular across the board profile. He has an exact 100 wRC+ in his career, which is always fun. Not a league winner, but the deeper the league, the more valuable he becomes, and he can definitely be a low end starter on a shallower championship team too. - 2025 Projection: 82/17/71/.269/.320/.410/18

209) Ivan Herrera - STL, C, 24.10 - With Willson Contreras moving to 1B, Herrera is taking over as St. Louis' starting catcher, and he has the potential to be a truly impact fantasy catcher with hit, power, and stolen bases in his arsenal. He's coming off a rookie year where he put up a 127 wRC+ with a .366 xwOBA in 72 games. That xwOBA led all catchers. Leading all catchers in xwOBA in your rookie year is damn exciting. He does everything offensively with a 9% Barrel%, 89.3 MPH EV, 9.2 degree launch and a 20.5/9.7 K%/BB%. His 73.3 MPH swing is easily plus, giving him a pretty potent swing speed/contact combo. His 27.3 ft/sec sprint is about average, and he's started to run more with 11 steals in 83 games at Triple-A in 2023, and now 8 steals in 99 games split between Triple-A and the majors this year. Chipping in like that helps when other catchers might get you 0-2 steals. His launch isn't conducive to big homer totals, but he definitely has the potential to hit much more than he hit this year, and if you want a catcher who doesn't tank your BA, Herrera is your man. He's my top catcher target for dynasty. - 2025 Projection: 72/15/66/.271/.340/.428/7

210) J.T. Realmuto - PHI, C, 34.0 - Realmuto battled a sore knee basically all season and it limited him to 99 games. It's likely why he stole just 2 bags in 4 attempts. Without stolen bases, his profile gets a lot more pedestrian, and while his 28.4 ft/sec sprint speed was still high, it seems like wishful thinking to count on him continuing to steal a considerable amount of bags as he enters his mid 30's. He hits the ball hard enough with a 89.2/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV to have plenty of value without the steals, but it definitely lops off some upside off the top. And we also have to start taking age related decline into account. I still think he's a very good win now catcher, but his dynasty value is definitely on the decline. - 2025 Projection: 73/21/75/.265/.328/.443/9

211) Salvador Perez - KCR, C/1B, 34.11 - I keep trying to predict Perez' decline, and he keeps chugging along just fine, finishing as the 3rd best catcher in fantasy in 2024. As usual, he ripped dingers with 27 homers, a 91.1 MPH EV, and 19.0 degree launch. He also managed to actually improve his plate approach with a 6 year best 19.8% K% and career best 6.7% BB%. He still chases a ton with a 42.9% Chase%, but a 73.2 MPH swing is firmly plus, so the cliff ain't here yet. Father time is obviously undefeated, so the decline will come soon, but it sure seems like he has some more good seasons in him yet. I just still feel hesitant to be the one left holding the bag when it does happen. - 2025 Projection: 59/26/83/.258/.307/.451/0

212) Josh Jung - TEX, 3B, 27.2 - Jung suffered a broken wrist after getting hit by a pitch just 4 games into the season, and wrist injuries are known to linger and absolutely kill hitters. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened with Jung. He underwent surgery to repair the wrist, and when he returned in late July, he just wasn't the same hitter. He put up a 86.2 MPH EV after notching a 91.8 MPH EV in 2023. It's clear he wasn't healthy, and the Rangers ended up shutting him down in late September. He then got another surgery on the tendon in that wrist in October. I'm pretty scared off by wrist injuries for hitters. It ended Alex Kirilloff's career before it could even get off the ground, among others. Like with his teammate Evan Carter, I don't want to just live in complete fear of an injury, and nobody really knows if it will eventually completely heal, or if this is now going to be a constant problem. And like Carter, I just don't think it makes sense to sell low in cases like this. We've seen what a healthy Jung could do in 2023 (23 homers in 122 games), and while it's anyone's guess if he will be completely healthy in 2025, I would hold on to find out. He's a hold. I would definitely take a star away in OBP leagues though, as he now has 805 MLB PA with a .301 OBP. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/78/.253/.307/.445/6

213) Brandon Nimmo - NYM, OF, 32.0 - Nimmo stole a career high by far 15 bags in 151 games out of nowhere. He stole 3 in 2023 and 2022. He was also a perfect 15 for 15, and he was a terrible base stealer every other year of his career. It's almost like some players didn't prepare for the new rules in 2023, saw everyone else run wild, and then they were like, hey, I can do that too. And with a 28 ft/sec sprint, maybe he can keep up at least a large portion of the gains. He also backed up his power uptick from 2023 with a 9.1% Barrel%, 91.9 MPH EV, and 11.2 degree launch. A BABIP induced .224 BA was the only issue with his season, and without poor luck, he would have easily had yet another season of around a 130 wRC+. Nimmo has a career 128 wRC+ in 911 games. Come to think of it, is he the most underappreciated hitter of this generation? He's been consistently great his entire career, but this level up in power seems legit, and he finally learned how to steal bags. I actually don't think a monster season is out of the question this year. And add two stars in OBP leagues as a lot of the career wRC+ is due to double plus walk rates. - 2025 Projection: 91/23/86/.258/.349/.451/9

214) Xander Bogaerts - SDP, 2B/SS, 32.6 - Bogaerts put up a .581 OPS in his first 47 games before hitting the IL with a fractured shoulder. He's been such a lukewarm fantasy player for a little while now, and at already 31 years old, I was just about ready to put the dagger in his fantasy value, but he returned a new man not even 2 months later. He closed out the season slashing .299/.338/.432 with 7 homers, 9 steals, and a 14.8/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 64 games. It's still not a profile I'm looking to buy into as he gets deeper into his 30's, but he clearly proved the shoulder injury wasn't as bad as it sounded. He should have a few more seasons of solid across the board production left in him. - 2025 Projection; 80/17/67/.278/.343/.429/17

215) Brice Turang - MIL, 2B, 25.5 - Turang stole 50 bags in 2024, which was 3rd in all of baseball behind only Elly and Shohei. Unfortunately, that is all he does with a 2.4% Barrel%, .254 BA (.261 xBA),.665 OPS, and .297 xwOBA. He's a bottom of the order guy, but his plate skills are pretty good (17.0/8.1 K%/BB%), and he walked a lot in the minors, so his path to improvement is putting up a good enough BA/OBP to hit at the top of the order. He's a good defensive 2B and a good SS too, so his glove should keep him on the field. - 2025 Projection: 76/9/55/.263/.322/.379/41

216) Gleyber Torres - DET, 2B, 28.4 - Gleyber had a very easy to identify down season. They happen. He was 27 in a contract year and the individual components of the underlying numbers were all in line with career norms. I don't think he just fell off out of nowhere. Plus, the hot streak did finally come at the end of the season with a .861 OPS in his final 35 games. He's an easy bet to bounce back, but he landed in Detroit, which is one of the worst parks for righty homers, so that isn't going to help his upside at all. Another issue for fantasy is that he isn't a good base stealer, he's slow, and he stole only 4 bags last year, so we aren't really talking about big upside here. He's more of a solid bat than a standout one. - 2025 Projection: 84/23/72/.265/.338/.444/8

217) Andres Gimenez - TOR, 2B, 26.7 - The power uptick just isn't coming for Gimenez with it actually going in the opposite direction in 2024 with a career worst 2.8% Barrel%. It led to just 9 homers in 152 games. You can tell Cleveland gave up on it too, trading him for essentially rotation depth (and some upside in Ortiz). He's also a bottom of the order hitter with a 4.1% BB%. He's one of the best defensive 2B in baseball, so the glove will keep him on the field, and the contact/speed profile is legit with a 15.3% K% and 30 steals. You can never say never when it comes to power upticks in your mid to late 20's, but the indicators just aren't there to bet on it. - 2025 Projection: 73/14/65/.262/.321/.396/30

218) Maikel Garcia - KCR, 3B/2B, 25.1 - Garcia was a major target for me last off-season, and while he didn't have the game power breakout I thought was possible, and despite being very unlucky, he still finished 115th overall on the Razzball Player Rater, which is better than I expected considering the disappointing season. His 37 steals were the 7th most in baseball, and he only got caught 2 times. He hit only .231, but with a 16.5% K% and 90.4 MPH EV, that is so clearly the result of bad luck (.260 xBA). He didn't make any attempts to unlock more game power with a low launch and low pull rate, so that just might not be an adjustment he's interested in making. He's entering his mid 20's, and I do still think a game power uptick is possible, but it's hard to count on it. He's an above average defensive player at 3B and he doesn't have much competition for the job, so all indications are that KC is going to run it back with Garcia in 2025, but it's likely to come at the bottom of the order this year, especially after the India trade. I can't say he's a major target for me this off-season, and while I lean calling him a miss, maybe a neutral is more accurate. He's settling in as a contact/speed play, but the high EV gives him just enough of an upside boost to stay interesting. - 2025 Projection: 76/10/64/.266/.320/.382/29

219) Ha-Seong Kim - TBR, SS, 29.6 - Kim's season ended in mid August with a shoulder injury that resulted in labrum surgery in October, and it's expected to keep him out into May. Shoulder injuries are also high risk when it comes to hitting. And it's also not great for projecting steals, because it's possible he decides to play it safe, or at least safer on the bases to not reinjure the shoulder. So he doesn't seem like the best value for 2025, and by 2026, he will be entering his 30's. It kinda puts his dynasty value in limbo, and I would be hard pressed to value him too highly right now. If not for the injury, I would have really loved him. His underlying skills have gotten better every single year of his stateside career, culminating with a career best 87.9 MPH EV and 16.4/12.3 K%/BB% in 121 games. He's a 30+ steals guy with some real pop (mid teens homers) and pretty elite plate skills. He only hit .233 last year, and while some of that was definitely bad luck, he does hit the ball in the air a lot, and not all that hard, so it's not all bad luck. But it's the injury that is truly holding me back from going higher, because without that, I would be a big fan. - 2025 Projection: 61/12/45/.252/.336/.390/20

220) Tyler Soderstrom - OAK, 1B, 23.4 - Soderstrom hit 2 homers in 26 games at home vs. 7 homers in 35 games on the road. Sacramento is a well below average hitter's park for Triple-A, but I would be surprised if it didn't play at least neutral, and maybe much better than that in relation to major league parks, while Oakland was one of the worst parks for homers. For a pure power hitting prospect, getting out of Oakland is a major upside boost for his value, and with how hard Soderstrom hits the ball, he's actually a major target for me this off-season. He's my Mark Vientos of 2025. The dude smokes the ball with a 91.9/97.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, resulting in a near elite 14.6% Barrel%. That is truly beastly power. Like Vientos, that is really the only attribute he brings, but near elite power conquers all, and the hit tool and plate approach were very encouraging as well, relatively. He put up a very respectable 24.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 61 games. On the downside, a 30.1% whiff% shows the hit tool isn't completely out of the woods yet, and he's also a true 0 in stolen bases. He might not end up as underrated as Vientos by the time draft season rolls around, but there is little chance his power will get the respect it deserves with the ballpark upgrade coming. Nick Kurtz is charging quickly for the 1B job, but I find it hard to believe that Oakland will be crowded enough to push Soderstrom out if he's raking (he should get some run at catcher too, possibly gaining eligibility during the season), and I'm betting on him raking. Go after him. - 2025 Projection: 69/27/81/.248/.323/.465/1

221) Jorge Soler - LAA, OF, 33.1 - Soler got traded out of San Francisco, and magically the power returned with 9 homers in 49 games with Atlanta and only 12 homers in 93 games with SF (and only 4 homers in 49 games at SF-Oracle Park). This is why I like Conforto so much. Bad ballparks can simply crush power hitters. Soler signed with the Angels this off-season (Top 10 ballpark for righty homers), so he landed in a great spot. He absolutely crushes the ball with a 12.6% Barrel%, 90.5 MPH EV, and an elite 75.4 MPH swing, he lifts it with a 17.9 degree launch, and his contact rates have stabilized for a while now with a 24.6/11.8 K%/BB%. I'm looking at the Angels lineup right now, and I actually like it a ton if things breaking right. Trout can't stay healthy and Neto already might not be ready for the start of the season, so banking on things breaking right might not be a good bet, but I'm just saying. Christian Moore is waiting in the wings too, and Mathew Lugo ain't chopped liver either. They signed Kikuchi, Soriano is a favorite of mine, and they have pretty damn good rotation depth in the minors. It's not a high end rotation, but it's kinda deep. I gotta say, with a Win O/U at 71.5, that could be my favorite O/U on the slate. I can't in good conscious recommend you follow in my footsteps, but I'm in on that (and you know I'm crazy enough I'll pop that WS long shot bet on them too ha). - 2025 Projection: 80/28/80/.242/.330/.471/1

222) Michael Conforto - LAD, OF, 32.1 - If you missed out on Teoscar Hernandez' monster bounce back season, the universe is giving you another chance this off-season to rectify that mistake. It is nearly an exact replica of the Teoscar situation with Conforto this off-season. The Dodgers signed Conforto to a 1 year, $17 million contract, and it's almost like nobody else in baseball understands how ballpark factors work. I'm starting to think the Dodgers are so "smart" only relative to how dumb everyone else is. Conforto goes from the 28th worst park for lefty homers (SF) to the 6th best. He hit 3 homers at home vs. 17 on the road. I mean, come on. Could it get anymore obvious? Yes. Yes it can. He had a 11.8% Barrel%, a 90.2/95.4 MPH AVG/LD EV, 14.8 degree launch, a 74.1 MPH swing, and 24.2/8.6 K%/BB%. And he actually hit lefties better than righties last year, so there isn't that much platoon risk. There was no team out there willing to give him a 2 or 3 year deal? You let the Dodgers just do it again? He's a major win now buy target going for a song of a price (still only 280th overall NFBC ADP over the last month). 2025 Projection: 77/25/84/.250/.338/.468/2

223) Matt Wallner - MIN, OF, 27.3 - Wallner has 580 PA in his 3 year career and is slashing .251/.366/.500 with 29 homers, 6 steals, and a 34.5/10.0 K%/BB%. It's good for a 144 wRC+. I mean, that is no joke. His 77.2 MPH swing is in the elite of the elite, and he utterly smashes the ball with a 17.5% Barrel% and 92.8 MPH EV. Yea, the strikeout rate is high, and yea, he doesn't hit lefties well, but this is an absolutely extraordinary power hitter. Even in a platoon role, I almost don't see how he wouldn't crack 30 homers, and while the counterargument is that you have to make contact in order to hit homers, he has a career .251 BA in a not that small of a sample. I see the negatives, but I don't know, that upside is too high for me to focus on them. I'm in on Wallner. - 2025 Projection: 72/30/83/.241/.348/.491/5

224) Jo Adell - LAA, OF, 26.0 - I feel crazy for even saying this, but I think Jo Adell is a target for me this off-season. I know, I know, even saying it out loud sounds downright silly, but hear me out. He just put up a .312 xwOBA in 130 games, which is nearly average, and he massively improved his contact rates with a 29.8% whiff% (38.5% in 2023) and 27.9% K% (40.3% in 2023). Nobody doubts his humongous talent, but just in case you need a reminder, his 76.7 MPH swing is 5th best in all of baseball. The names around him on that leaderboard are Stanton, Oneil Cruz, Schwarber, Judge, Chapman, Yordan, Ohtani, Julio, and Gunnar. The only qualified hitter in that area who wasn't good was Christopher Morel. If you lower the minimum qualification you will get more hit tool busts like Adell, but point being it shows off legit monster talent. And he has the EV to back it up with a 89.8/96.4 MPH AVG/FB EV. That FB EV is near elite. He also has plus speed with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint. He only hit .207 with a 90 wRC+ on the season, but he slashed .253/.341/.440 with 6 homers, 5 steals, and a 25.3/10.0 K%/BB% in his final 46 games before his season ended with an oblique injury. It can often take uber athletes into their mid to late 20's to figure out the hit tool, but when they do, it can pay off huge. It sure seems like Adell took a big step forward there in 2024. I know I'm going to end up regretting this, hah, but boy do I like Adell a lot right now relative to his perceived value. - 2025 Projection: 72/26/81/.237/.310/.449/15

225) Nolan Jones - COL, OF, 26.10 - Jones had a bad back basically the entire season, and he played like a guy who had a bad back. You can see the underlying skills were still there and still solid, but the impact and explosion was completely non existent. The Barrel% tanked from 15.7% to 5.9%, despite a still solid 88.2/93.3 MPH AVG/FB EV. The steals dropped from 20 in 106 games to 5 in 79 games, despite a still solid 28.1 ft/sec sprint. And as we've seen with Yelich's bad back, he struggled to keep the launch up, with it dropping from 9.8 degrees to 7.8 degrees. The skills were in there, but the explosion was gone. The one positive takeaway from his season is that despite still striking out 30.6% of the time, he brought his whiff% way down to 25.6% (31.9% in 2023). That does take some of the edge off the hit tool downside, even though it's obviously still a risk. And his plate approach remained excellent with a 23.1% Chase% and 12.1% BB%. If the back is completely healthy, and that explosion returns, the huge season we were expecting out of Jones in 2024 can easily still happen in 2025. The problem is that we know back injuries can linger, and it's no guarantee he's completely healthy. Jones is a strong hold for me. I can't say I'm particularly going after him, but I would really want to give him one more year before making any drastic decisions. - 2025 Projection: 76/20/76/.245/.342/.433/14

226) Jose Soriano - LAA, RHP, 26.6 - Everyone is focused on the Garrett Crochet and Reynaldo Lopez success stories of relievers being transitioned (back) into starters, and that allows Soriano to fly ever so quietly under the radar, putting him in perfect target territory. He put up a 3.42 ERA with a 20.7/9.6 K%/BB% in 113 IP. The K% isn't high, but he makes up for that with a negative 6 degree launch on the back of an elite 97.7 MPH sinker. It was the 4th most valuable sinker in baseball, behind only Wheeler, Skenes and Webb. That is heady territory right there. And it's not like he doesn't have an out pitch secondary with a plus to double plus curve that put up a 40.2% whiff% on 25.4% usage. He also throws a lesser used splitter (32.9% whiff% on 8.1% usage) and slider (46.3% whiff% on 5.5% usage), giving him 3 legit swing and miss secondaries. He put up a 36.2% whiff% in 42 IP out of the bullpen in 2023, so it's clear this guy has strikeout upside. And it's clear he has nasty stuff with elite ground ball rates. His excellent 2024 was not a fluke, and I think it's just the beginning. He reminds of a righty Framber Valdez before Valdez' control took a step forward, which is the last thing Soriano needs to do if he want to become a #2 fantasy starter. His season ended in mid August with arm fatigue, which isn't great, but it doesn't seem serious. I'm all systems go for Soriano this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.62/1.21/144 in 150 IP

227) Yusei Kikuchi - LAA, LHP, 33.2 - Houston fully unleashed the beast in Kikuchi with a 2.70 ERA and 31.8/5.9 K%/BB% in 60 IP. He put up a 4.75 ERA with a 26.2/6.0 K%/BB% in 115.2 IP with Toronto. He started throwing the slider more and the curve less after the trade, and considering his slider has put up much better Run Value's the past 2 seasons, yea, that makes sense. Is the difference between smart franchises and not as smart franchises just like, competence? This isn't high level stuff here. I also think smart franchises gain considerable edges with pitch calling and defensive alignments, so it's not purely just "throw this pitch more," it's more nuanced than that. All of that to say, signing with the Angels is not great news hah. I'm not running for the hills or anything, because he still has an enticing profile. He has big velocity with a bat missing 95.5 MPH fastball (28.0% whiff%), the control gains from 2023 actually took another step forward, and his 3 secondaries are average to above average. If he went to a good organization, I would have like him even more, but he still deserves a good ranking with the Angels. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.83/1.24/193 in 169 IP

228) Tanner Houck - BOS, RHP, 28.9 - Houck put up a 3.12 ERA in 178.2 IP, but let's see what all the ERA estimators say about that. SIERA isn't buying it at 3.73. xERA hates his guts at 4.11. xFIP is a bit more forgiving, but still not all the way in at 3.58. And then there is the OG ERA estimator, FIP, and FIP is kinda digging it at 3.32. FIP isn't cool anymore with all the new kids on the block, but FIP was banging back before xERA was even a thought, so maybe we put some respect back on it's name. Houck's walk rate took a big step forward, moving into plus territory with a 6.5% BB% (8.9% in 2023). His sweeper was the 5th most valuable sweeper in baseball. His splitter was the 5th most valuable splitter in baseball. And his sinker was an above average pitch that kept the ball on the ground with a 2 degree launch. With a 215 NFBC ADP, nobody is really buying in, but maybe FIP is on to something? I can't deny that I too don't buy it, because strikeouts are king for fantasy, and he simply didn't miss enough bats with a 20.7% K% and 22.6% whiff%, but he has a career 26.7% whiff%, so it's not like the ability isn't in there. I agree with the masses to not buy into his career year, but I have the old wise FIP whispering in my ear to maybe not be so skeptical. I'm still not buying, but I hear ya, FIP, and I will give you your respect if Houck does repeat his big year, or maybe even builds off it. 2025 Projection: 11/3.67/1.19/159 in 172 IP

229) Cristopher Sanchez - PHI, LHP, 28.4 - I was skeptical that Sanchez could maintain the monster control gains he made in 2023, but he proved the gains were mostly real with a 5.8% BB% this year, and it resulted in a very good season. He put up a 3.32 ERA with a 20.3% K% in 181.2 IP. The strikeouts were lower than optimal, but he keeps the ball on the ground with a 57.4% GB% that was the 5th best mark in baseball (90 IP min). He also has an elite changeup that notched a .193 xwOBA and 34.6% whiff%, to go along with an average to above average slider. He's not likely to ever be a huge K guy, but I think he can do better than he did this year, and his overall profile is very enticing. Solid velocity (94.1 MPH sinker), plus control, elite ground ball rates, an elite secondary, and a starter's pitch mix. I wasn't buying last year, but I would be willing to dip my toe in this year if the price is right. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.55/1.21/157 in 175 IP

230) Spencer Arrighetti - HOU, RHP, 25.2 - Arrighetti is in the same bucket as DJ Herz for me. Both were former targets of mine who I eventually moved off of, but now I'm still super proud to see them breaking out on the MLB level even if I can't truly call them hits anymore. Too much time has passed between their target status and their breakout. But the good news is that both still have value left on the bone for 2025 and beyond, and I'm ready to dive back in head first on both of them. Arrighetti struggled hard when he first got the call, but once he found his groove, he was a beast, He put up a 3.08 ERA with a 29.0/8.3 K%/BB% in his final 76 IP. The fastball isn't a particularly good pitch, but it has solid velocity at 94.1 MPH, and it can miss bats with a 19.8% whiff%. The secondaries are where he shines with a dominant curveball that notched a .207 xwOBA and 42.4% whiff%, a plus sweeper that notched a .198 xwOBA and 38.6% whiff%, and a cutter that put up a +4 Run Value. He also throws a bat missing changeup with a 37.8% whiff%. As long as the control/command stays in that average-ish area, this looks like a high K, mid rotation starter to me. He's had bouts of control problems in that past, and also velocity fluctuations, so there is still risk here, but I love chasing K's in fantasy, and Arrighetti knows how to miss bats. Don't overpay, and with a 214 NFBC ADP, he's already getting valued pretty highly (as opposed to Herz with a 321 ADP), but that still isn't an unreasonable price to pay. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.88/1.29/180 in 160 IP

231) Reynaldo Lopez - ATL, RHP, 31.3 - Lopez clearly got very lucky in 2024 with a 1.99 ERA vs. 3.88 xERA in 135.2 IP, but with the way he closed out the season, I'm apt to buy his breakout as legit. He put up a 1.74 ERA with a 46/5 K/BB in his final 31 IP. His K/BB numbers were very pedestrian before that, but instead of his ERA regressing towards his K/BB numbers, the K/BB numbers progressed towards his ERA. And he definitely has the stuff to buy in. He throws gas with a 95.5 MPH fastball, and his secondaries miss a ton of bats with his slider leading the way with a 44.3% whiff%, finishing as the 5th most valuable slider in baseball. He battled a minor forearm and shoulder injury in the 2nd half of the season, but he came back from both of them no worse for the wear, so I'm not apt to dock him too much for that. He's in a weird spot where the lucky ERA might inflate his value too high, but at the same time, it doesn't really seem like anybody is buying in too hard. Based on my read, I actually think there might be some value left on the bone here. I'm buying and he seems like he will fall into a very reasonable range this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.61/1.16/168 in 160 IP

232) Ryan Weathers - MIA, LHP, 25.4 - Weathers is teetering on the edge for me between a "stick your neck out for him" target and a "let him come to you" target, but the one thing I am sure of, is that he is a target for me. A physical lefty at 6'1''. 230 pounds with a 95.9 MPH fastball, 2 plus to double plus secondaries in his changeup (37.9% whiff% with a .243 xwOBA), and sweeper (51% whiff% with a .208 xwOBA), and above average to plus control (6.5% BB%) is a profile that is extremely hard to find. And it unsurprisingly lead to really good results with a 3.63 ERA and 21.8/6.5 K%/BB% in 86.1 IP. The 26.1% whiff% is well above average, so I'm not too concerned about the mediocre K rates. The one are that I don't love, which is why I don't know if I want to go full stick your neck out target for him, is that the fastballs aren't very good despite the high velocity, and he threw the 4-seamer or sinker 51.8% of the time. Neither missed many bats or induced weak contact. He's still a young developing pitcher at only 25 years old, so I think it's very possible he can improve his fastballs and/or pitch mix to hit a next level breakout, and even if he can't, he's pretty damn good as is. I'm definitely hoping to leave with Weathers in every draft he's available in, and if I can get him at a super low price, even better. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.75/1.21/150 in 150 IP

233) David Festa - MIN, RHP, 25.3 - I don't think Festa is actually going to be all that cheap this off-season despite his 4.90 ERA in 64.1 IP in his MLB debut, because we don't live in 2005, but I can see him going for pretty cheap in shallower leagues, and I think Festa is even worth targeting in those leagues. The 4.05 xERA was much better than the ERA, the 27.8/8.3 K%/BB% is excellent, and the stuff is really good. The fastball sat 94.7 MPH with good life, the changeup missed bats (39.4% whiff%) and induced weak contact (85.9 MPH EV), and the slider was above average with better surface stats than underlying stats. That's 3 above average to plus pitches which can all miss bats, to go along with average control. The one area of his game that prevents me from going all in on him as a young ace, is that his stuff gets hit pretty hard, and it got hit pretty hard at Triple-A too. His 4-seamer has a 91.3 MPH EV against and it was 93.4 MPH at Triple-A. The slider has a 90.2 MPH EV against (89.7 MPH at Triple-A). The high ERA is not a complete fluke. So I'm all in for buying low, but I'm stopping short of really valuing in that young ace tier. I'm putting him in the high K, fantasy friendly mid rotation starter tier for now. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.82/1.28/142 in 125 IP

234) DJ Herz - WAS, LHP, 24.3 - What is the victory lapping etiquette for dynasty baseball? In a redraft league, the etiquette is much easier to figure out. Wait until the end of the season and you are safe. But for dynasty, you are wading in much more treacherous waters. Enter DJ Herz, who I named a major target in 2022, only to back off of a bit coming into 2023 and 2024. Now that he broke out this season with a 4.16 ERA (3.29 xERA) and 27.7/9.4 K%/BB% in 88.2 IP, can I claim he's a "hit"? It feels weird to claim he's a hit when most people probably dropped him or sold low over those last 2 years. On the other hand, when ranking prospects, you can't truly know if someone is a hit or miss until several years down the line. Or maybe most importantly, does anyone give a crap? (I ruminate about this more in the Strategy/Thoughts section down below). At this point, the past is behind us, and it's time to figure out how to value Herz going forward. And my advice is to value him pretty damn high. His 93.5 MPH fastball is a legitimate elite weapon which he throws 54.2% of the time. The pitch notched a 30.5% whiff% which was 4th best amongst starting pitchers. That alone makes him a high K, mid-rotation fantasy starter, and well, to be honest, that is actually all he has. His slider and changeup are decent and mostly get the job done, but they both grade out as slightly below average. And of course the biggest red flag is his below average control. It took a step forward in the majors this year, which sparked this breakout, but it was getting worse towards the end of the season, and it adds in a healthy dose of risk to his profile. I don't believe Herz will be hyped to death this off-season, making him a relatively reasonably priced target if you to chase upside (control and/or secondaries improving can unlock near top of the fantasy rotation upside), but make sure to factor in the real risk (you can only be so good with a 12% BB% and mediocre secondaries). - 2025 Projection: 9/3.73/1.25/181 in 155 IP

235) Ben Brown - CHC, RHP, 25.7 - Brown is one of my top pitcher targets for 2025. I've been calling him a target for a few years now in that bucket of pitching prospect that I love to shop in (close to the majors, big stuff, upper minors production, moderate to little hype), and now that he's proven it in the majors, he becomes a true 5 alarm target. And the best part is, even after he proved it in the majors, he's still getting majorly underrated. He put up a 3.58 ERA with a 28.8/8.6 K%/BB% in 55.1 IP. A neck injury ended his season in June, but the expectation is for him to have a normal off-season. He throws gas with a 96.4 MPH fastball that was an above average pitch (although the underlying numbers weren't as good). His curveball was amongst the very best in baseball with a 51% whiff% and .183 xwOBA. He performed better against righties than he did lefties, but even with just two pitches basically, he still put up an above average .304 wOBA vs lefties. He also threw a lesser used changeup, cutter, sinker and sweeper at Triple-A in 2023, so I don't think he is locked in as a two pitch pitcher. The cutter in particular seems to have promise as a third pitch. Point being, even with two pitches I think he can be a high K, mid rotation starter, and if he can find that effective 3rd+ pitch, there could be an even higher level in here. He's control over command, but it's good to see the walk rate stay about average in his MLB debut. He might start the season in the bullpen, but I don't think Chicago has plans to ban him to the bullpen permanently. They used him as a starter last year and he was great, so it would make little sense for them not to give him a full shot in the rotation long term. I'm going after him. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.79/1.23/150 in 130 IP

236) Quinn Mathews - STL, LHP, 24.6 - I think it's easy to completely hand wave Mathews getting bombed at Triple-A to close out the season (6.48 ERA with a 27.8/17.7 K%/BB% in 16.2 IP), but I do think there might be at least a small amount of signal there that we shouldn't just 100% dismiss. I'm not going to put too much emphasis on it either seeing as he was already at a career high in IP, and you have to give humans a chance to adjust to a new level, new team, new coaches etc ..., but there is one wrinkle that makes me pause, and that wrinkle is that Triple-A is the only level to use the MLB ball. Every other level uses their own balls, and I mean, the ball is a pretty important factor. Blade Tidwell obliterated Double-A, got called up to Triple-A earlier in the season, and then stunk at Triple-A for a large sample. Everyone hates Blade Tidwell now. Mathews (and Brandon Sproat has a similar story too), didn't have a large sample at Triple-A, so it's easy to just hand wave it away, but I do think it's something to keep in mind. Now just because I'm keeping it in mind, doesn't mean I still don't love Mathews. He's a 6'5'', lefty with a mid 90's fastball and two whiff machine secondaries in his slider and changeup (he also throws a curve and sinker). He dominated all season (other than at Triple-A) with a 2.76 ERA and 35.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 143.1 IP. And as you can see, he stays healthy, which does matter. I lean towards him being more of a #2 starter than a true ace, but add a star for his health, and he's knocking on the door of the bigs. I like him a ton. Maybe I just feel the need to knock him down a peg because of my love for Tink, who I have ranked higher than Mathews, while most have it the other way around. The truth is, I love both of them (just Tink more ;). 2025 Projection: 6/3.98/1.32/97 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.59/1.20/190 in 180 IP

237) Dalton Rushing - LAD, C/OF, 24.1 - It seems that LA is set on keeping Rushing at catcher, which I completely understand for real life value, but for fantasy, I don't think it's great. Will Smith is signed until 2034, meaning Rushing looks ticketed for some kind of hybrid C/1B/OF/DH role, and with how hard it is to crack the Dodgers full time lineup (and with how little leash they give their prospects due to unlimited resources and strong organizational depth), it seems like Rushing is going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. They are not rolling out the red carpet for him at all, and I do think it hurts his fantasy value a bit. Putting defense aside for now, as a pure hitter, there is so much to like. He proved himself in the upper minors in 2024, slashing .271/.385/.512 with 26 homers, 2 steals, and a 20.5/12.7 K%/BB% in 114 games split between Double-A (149 wRC+) and Triple-A (128 wRC+). He has easy plus power with a 90.8 MPH EV, he has a launch made for both power and average, and he has a plus plate approach. The hit tool is solid, but I can see that dipping to below average against major league pitching, and like I mentioned earlier, we have seen LA be very quick with the hook if young players aren't producing. I like the bat a ton, but defense, path to playing time, and the slight hit tool questions are enough to make me hesitant to really value him at a premium right now. - 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.242/.310/.428/1 Prime Projection: 78/24/83/.262/.339/.465/2

238) Termarr Johnson - PIT, 2B, 20.10 - It only took 23 games in Johnson's 2022 pro debut to realize that his hit tool was overrated coming of the draft, and that started to scare people off in 2023 and 2024 when that became even more glaringly obvious with a .244 BA and .237 BA in those respective years. But Johnson was never just a hit tool only guy, he has real power and speed, so while the hit tool troubles prevent him from rising to near elite prospect status as hoped, it doesn't prevent him from still being a really exciting prospect. He swings an electric and powerful lefty bat that hits the ball really hard, resulting in 15 homers in 124 games, and his speed has always been a bit undersold, nabbing 22 bags. The hit tool isn't as good as hoped, but the 21.3% K% isn't bad at all, and he put up a 19.3% in 14 games when he got the call to Double-A as a 20 year old, which is exciting to see. He's also an on base machine with a 15.6% BB%. With him falling out of favor in the mainstream, now is a really good opportunity to buy low if you can, because when he produces in the upper minors as a still 20 year old, the hype is going to hit all over again. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/23/78/.262/.343/.452/15

239) Zyhir Hope - LAD, OF, 20.2 - And this is why "In the Dodgers We Trust" is a dynasty motto that should be burned into our retinas. They take Hope, and turn it into reality. Hope was a high risk, high reward upside pick by the Cubs in 2023 who struck out 30.2% of the time in rookie ball in his pro debut. He got traded to the Dodgers in the off-season in the Michael Busch trade, and of course the Dodgers immediately drastically improved his only weakness, bringing the strikeout rate all the way down to 22.8% at mostly Single-A. There is still hit tool risk (he hit .228 with a 24.3% K% in 23 games in the AFL), but low to mid 20's hit tool risk is in an entirely other bucket than hovering around 30% hit tool risk. And the hit tool improved without impacting any other areas of his game, slashing .290/.419/.484 with 9 homers, 9 steals, a 22.8/15.1 K%/BB% and a 144 wRC+ in 61 games. The reasons he's not ranked even higher than this are because the ground ball rates are on the high side (45.1%), there is still hit tool risk, and his speed/stolen base skills seem to be more in the above average than truly great area. So a guy who swings and misses a lot, hits the ball on the ground, and doesn't run quite as much as we would like isn't necessarily a slam dunk. I'm saying this just as much to myself as I am to you, because it's hard not to fall head over heels for him. He hits the ball very hard, he's a great athlete, he's in a great organization, and he's done nothing but produce. I do feel some caution is warranted before really putting him into that near elite to elite prospect tier, but he's not too far off from that already. I'm thinking something like Randy Arozarena could be a good ceiling comp. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/22/81/.255/.338/.445/19

240) Luis Garcia - WAS, 2B, 24.11 - I see why one would buy into Luis Garcia. He was a talented prospect who got rushed to the majors and just had his big breakout season at 24 years old. That checks out. But personally, I'm not buying in. He hit a career high 18 homers in 140 games, but with a 47.4% GB% and 30.4% Pull%, that looks like the top of his ability, rather than some true upward trajectory. He stole a career high by far 22 bags (9 was his previous career high), but with a below average 27.2 ft/sec sprint, it seems shaky to really count on a follow up on that. And while the hit tool is good, a 21.3% whiff% is only above average, and a 36% Chase% is terrible, so the plate approach still isn't good. The final nail in the coffin is that he was already regressing by the end of the season with a .250 BA, 4 homers, and 3 steals (in 5 attempts) in his final 39 games. I kinda hesitate to call a 25 year old breakout a sell, because I generally don't play the game like that, but I would be all ears on Garcia this off-season if I can get a similarly objectively valued young breakout who I actually believe in more. - 2025 Projection: 69/16/76/.276/.312/.420/16

241) Jung Hoo Lee - SFG, OF, 26.7 - Lee underwent season ending shoulder surgery for a torn labrum after just 37 games into his MLB career, and while he's expected to be 100% going into 2025, it definitely adds in a healthy dose of risk. And he wasn't fully established yet on the MLB level either with a 83 wRC+. So there is a lot of risk here, and on the flip side, there isn't high upside either. He didn't have a big homer/steal combo in Korea, and he only hit 2 homers with 2 steals before the injury. High risk and low ceiling isn't exactly my favorite combo, ha, but this blurb started off more negative than I intended, because there were plenty of positives from his debut. The elite contact rates fully transferred with a 8.2% K%, he hit the ball hard with an 89.1 MPH EV, and he had plus speed with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint. Good things tend to happen on a baseball field when you have those 3 skills, so I have little doubt that Lee will eventually be a very good MLB hitter. The question is just if it will come in 2025 coming off the surgery, and also how much fantasy upside it will come with. - 2025 Projection: 84/13/58/.278/.337/.392/15

242) Nick Pivetta - SDP, RHP, 32.1 - Pivetta put up a career best year in 2023, and while I was hesitant to buy in because his entire career has been a rollercoaster ride, he actually 100% backed it up in 2024, if not built on it. He put up a 4.14 ERA, 1.13 WHIP, and a 28.9/6.1 K%/BB% in 145.2 IP. His 3.51 xERA shows he was on the unlucky side, and that 6.1% BB% was a career high by far (8.5% in 2023). Showing that level of control is huge for my confidence in his ability to possibly get off that rollercoaster career. The 25.6% whiff% isn't quite as impressive as the K rate, and he doesn't really have one dominant pitch, although the fastball/slider combo is very good. Mostly I feel like he's stabilized himself enough to make him a very good win now asset. San Diego is a great landing spot for him, so I'm apt to call him a buy for a win now team. His price should be pretty reasonable. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.88/1.20/176 in 158 IP

243) Ryan Walker - SFG, Closer, 29.4 - Doval's well below average control ended up tanking him, and Walker swooped right in to lock down San Francisco's closer job. He also has the no doubt stuff and production to hold the job with a 1.91 ERA and 32.1/5.8 K%/BB% in 80 IP. The 95.6 MPH sinker induces weak contact, and the plus to double plus slider misses bats. The 28.6% whiff% overall isn't quite as impressive at the K rate, and the 18.8% whiff% on the sinker, and 38% whiff% on the slider is good, but not great for a reliever. I suspect he isn't quite as good as he showed in 2024, but he's still really good. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.05/1.09/80/32 saves in 65 IP

244) Trevor Megill - MIL, Closer, 31.3 - With Devin Williams shipped out of town, Megill will get the first shot to nail down the closer job, and while I think he will do it, there is some risk after he faltered down the stretch. He dominated to start the season with a 1.53 ERA and 35/7 K/BB in 29.1 IP, but after missing time with a back injury, the stuff was down, the control was off, and the performance dropped upon his return. He put up a 4.76 ERA with a 15/7 K/BB in 17 IP to close out the season (although he was lights out in 2 playoff appearances). He most certainly has closer stuff with a 98.8 MPH fastball and a slider that put up a 55% whiff%. He's always had solid control too. The potential is there for him to be an elite or near elite closer, but there is just enough risk with his performance down the stretch that I want to have the smallest bit of caution before really ranking him in the elite area. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.17/1.11/78/30 saves in 60 IP

245) Raisel Iglesias - ATL, Closer, 35.3 - Iglesias' K/9 fell below 9.00 for the first time in his career with a 8.83 K/9, but with a 31.5% whiff%, I would have zero concerns about that. Not to mention that it also came with career bests in ERA (1.95), WHIP (0.74) and BB/9 (1.69). There are zero signs of a decline with a double plus 4 pitch. The changeup, 4-seamer, slider and sinker put up a .249, .221, .190. and .285 xwOBA, which is quite remarkable. He's old, but he's still elite. - 2025 Projection: 5/2.73/0.95/74/33 saves in 65 IP

246) Jeff Hoffman - TOR, Closer, 32.3 - Hoffman signed a 3 year, $33 million control with Toronto, so they are obviously confident enough in his health, but word on the street is that other teams passed on him after he failed their physicals. All relievers are super volatile, so I don't want to be too scared off, but it's hard not to at least take that into account. He was fully healthy in 2024, and he was straight up elite with a 2.17 ERA and 33.6/6.0 K%/BB% in 66 IP. He throws gas with a bat missing 96.6 MPH fastball, the heavily used slider is elite, and the lesser used splitter is also elite. Assuming full health, he is in the elite of the elite, but he's already 32 years old, and failing multiple physicals doesn't seem like a great omen. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.98/1.01/79/30 saves in 62 IP

247) Christian Encarnacion-Strand - CIN, 1B, 25.4 - Strand's season ended on May 7th with ligament damage in his right hand which required season ending surgery, but the good news is that he was able to get healthy enough in time for the AFL where he put up a .930 OPS in 8 games. It's a good sign that he should be healthy for 2025. My initial gut reaction is to call him a buy low as his rookie year (13 homers with a 111 wRC+ in 63 games) was much better than his 2024 even before the injury (33 wRC+ with 2 homers in 29 games), but when I dig in a little more, there are a few things that concern me. His 71.3 MPH swing isn't special, it's about average, and it comes with a poor 29.4% whiff% and horrific 40.5% Chase%. That is really not a trifecta of skills that you want to have. He doesn't provide defensive value, he's never walked much in his career, and he doesn't provide value on the bases. Seeing his 220 ADP in NFBC Drafts, I'm concerned he might be a hair overrated at the moment. He has a long history of hitting for power and Cincinnati is one of the best ballparks in the league, but I really thought I was going to like Strand a lot more before digging into him for this blurb. I think I'm kinda lukewarm on him right now. - 2025 Projection: 68/26/79/.245/.304/.449/2

248) Paul Goldschmidt - NYY, 1B, 37.7 - When a 36 year old puts up the worst offensive season of his career by a large margin, you better believe their dynasty value is going to fall off a cliff. I agree that you don't want to underrate really, really good win now pieces just because they are in their 30's, but Goldy is a good reminder that there is a cost to that as well. When the decline comes, any hope of recouping their value for future pieces goes out the window. So if you are a Goldy owner, at this point, you might as well continue to ride this thing into the ground. And the good news is that you may just be able to squeeze another year or two of production out of him. He was definitely on the unlucky side with a .310 wOBA vs. .329 xwOBA, although that xwOBA was also a career low by far. But most importantly, he still absolutely crushed the ball with a 91.2/96.5 MPH AVG/FB EV. As long as you hit the ball that hard, you are going to produce no matter how much the plate approach diminishes. And the plate approach is where we are seeing the decline with a 26.5/7.2 K%/BB%. At 37 years old, it's possible we see another step back, but landing with the Yanks is a solid spot for him. I'm just worried the name value is too high for the price to be right for me. - 2025 Projection: 75/24/83/.259/.331/.440/11

249) Rhys Hoskins - MIL, 1B, 32.0 - Hoskins was definitely a diminished version of himself coming back from ACL surgery that wiped out his entire 2023 season. He had career lows in EV (88.7), xwOBA (.301), wRC+ (100), and K% (28.8%). But it's not like he was all that far off from career norms taken all together. His 12.7% Barrel% was excellent, his 26.3% whiff% was right in line with career norms (which helps alleviate some of the BA concerns from this year) and he still hit 26 homers in 131 games. With a full normal off-season to get further removed from that surgery, and at "only" 32 years old, I can see a few more prime years in the tank here. Or maybe he's getting older and more injured, and this is the new normal. That uncertainty is what is keeping his price low, and I'm inclined to take a shot on him as a win now team who wants to target a reasonably priced, proven power bat. - 2025 Projection: 72/29/85/.233/.320/.452/3

250) Max Muncy - LAD, 3B, 34.7 - You can nitpick some signs of decline, like his 7 year worst 10.8% Barrel% (career 13.3% Barrel%), and at 34 years old, I get why you wouldn't want to let any signs of decline slip by you, but overall, he really hasn't shown much decline. He put up a 135 wRC+ in 73 games which is the third best mark of his career. He missed a large chunk of time with an oblique injury, but he put up a 158 wRC+ in 33 games when he returned, so that doesn't look like a long term issue. We know exactly who he is as a low BA, high OBP slugger, and while it's hard to predict the decline, it sure seems like he has at least another big year in the tank here. - 2025 Projection:  83/31/89/.228/.345/.482/1

251) Zach Eflin - BAL, LHP, 31.0 - Eflin wasn't able to fully maintain his 2023 breakout with his K% falling all the way back down to 19.6% (26.5% in 2023). Part of it was that the 2023 strikeout rate was lucky, and another part of it was by choice, as he threw his curveball less and his cutter more this year. Either way, it's the elite control that you can bank on with a 3.5% BB%, and it's been elite essentially his entire career. Even without being able to maintain the K breakout, he did maintain the ERA breakout with a 3.50 ERA and the 3.67 xERA to back it up. He's your classic elite control, excellent WHIP mid rotation fantasy starter. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.75/1.13/149 in 168 IP

252) Ronel Blanco - HOU, RHP, 31.7 - Blanco has some things to like about his game, and some things to dislike, making him one of the players I am torn on. The things not to like are very obvious, which is the 4.00 xERA with a 24.6/10.1 K%/BB%. That doesn't support the 2.80 ERA at all. Not even close. But when you dig a little deeper, he did put up a 29% whiff%, which is no joke, on the back of 3 swing and miss secondaries that were all plus pitches with plus whiff rates. The slider was actually the 3rd best slider in baseball according to Run Value behind only Chris Sale and Dylan Cease. I definitely don't want to buy the 2.80 ERA, but I also don't want to run too far in the other direction. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.85/1.25/170 in 165 IP

253) Bowden Francis - TOR, RHP, 28.11 - Francis was a decently popular sleeper pick this off-season (not by me), and while I bet a lot of people gave up on him Parker Meadows style when he got off to a rough start, hurt his forearm, and then returned in a bullpen role, just like Parker Meadows, he totally redeemed himself by the end of the season. He got re-inserted into the rotation for good in August and put up a 1.53 ERA with a 26.5/3.3 K%/BB% in his final 59 IP. His season numbers were good too with a 3.30 ERA, 0.93 WHIP, and 22.5/5.4 K%/BB% in 103.2 IP. He threw his splitter, sinker, and particularly his slider more in the 2nd half, and threw the curve less if you are looking for real improvements that could make the 2nd half numbers stick. His slider put up a 43.6% whiff%, so smart move throwing that more. And he threw it 3.3 MPH slower than last year, so that could be a real weapon moving forward. His 92.9 MPH fastball doesn't miss a ton of bats or induce particularly weak contact, but it put up a +13 Run Value which was the 16th best in baseball. It was +6 in 2023 as well, so it might not be a fluke there. He doesn't miss a ton of bats in general with a 21.2% whiff%, and he doesn't really induce weak contact with a 8.7% Barrel%, so I'm a little hesitant to buy in too hard, but he made real changes in the 2nd half which could easily carry over into 2025. With a 206 NFBC ADP, it seems everyone is hedging a bit on Francis, and I'm probably in the same camp. His value seems right, and if I had to lean one way, I would lean a buy. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.63/1.18/146 in 150 IP

254) Hagen Smith - CHW, LHP, 21.7 - Selected 6th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the White Sox know a thing or two about developing vicious lefty starters with funky deliveries and some control risk. They've done just fine with Chris Sale, Garrett Crochet, and Noah Schultz. The 6'3'', 225 pound Hagen Smith is next on that list with a three quarter arm slot delivery that he uses to fire a double plus mid 90's fastball and double plus slider. Both pitches are whiff machines, leading to a 2.04 ERA with a 48.6%/10.3% K%/BB% in 84 IP in the SEC. He also mixes in a splitter, and while he doesn't throw it that often, it's a good pitch when he goes to it. The walk rate is on the high side, and it was worse in his freshman and sophomore seasons with a 13.4% BB% in 148.3 IP. Improving his control/command and turning his splitter into a higher usage 3rd weapon can turn Smith into a true ace. If he can't improve in those areas, a high K, mid-rotation starter is within the range of outcomes (and I guess the bullpen is too, but you don't take a guy 6th overall to use him in the bullpen long term). I'm surprised that Smith was allowed to debut in 2024, but Chicago marches to the beat of their own drum. He more than held his own at High-A with a 3.52 ERA and 21.2/6.1 K%/BB% in 7.2 IP over 3 outings. The filthy stuff was as advertised, and while the K numbers weren't off the charts, it's nice to see that clean walk rate. Add a star for being young for the class, but take a star away for already undergoing Tommy John when he was 16 years old. - 2025 Projection: 2/3.91/1.28/50 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/203 in 175 IP

255) Hayden Birdsong - SFG, RHP, 23.7 - Birdsong is a major target this off-season. I know he had extreme control problems in his MLB debut with a 13.7% BB%, but that is what is keeping his price/hype down so low, and there is just too much upside to be scared off by that. He throws gas with a 95.8 MPH fastball, and he has 3 secondaries that are all fire. The curve put up a .217 xwOBA and 32.7% whiff%. The changeup put up a .273 xwOBA and 34.9% whiff%. And the slider put up a .292 xwOBA and 48.7% whiff%. He's had control problems in the minors too, but on the whole, they were never quite as bad as he showed in the majors, so I think that was the very low end of his ability. He has high K, mid-rotation starter written all over him at peak, and he'll get to pitch in one of the best pitcher's parks in the majors. Use his control problems and lack of rotation spot to your advantage, because this is the type of K upside to chase in fantasy. Go after him. - 2025 Projection: 7/3.89/1.32/138 in 120 IP

256) Thomas White - MIA, LHP, 20.6 - White is in the pole position to be the top pitching prospect in baseball by this time next year (with Travis Sykora and Alejandro Rosario right on his tail). He's a built up 6'5'' lefty with such dominant stuff that he basically slept walked through the lower minors. He quickly got the call to High-A and put up a 2.61 ERA with a 29.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 62 IP. He throws from an easy and athletic three quarter arm slot delivery which he uses to fire a mid 90's fastball that completely overpowered lower minors hitters. He also has a plus breaking ball that he will use in any count to go along with a lesser used, but still very good changeup. He's not a finished product as he'll have some bouts of control problems, and he needs to continue to refine all 3 of his pitches really, but for his first year out of high school, that is an insanely impressive first full year of pro ball. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.39/1.15/215 in 185 IP

257) Travis Sykora - WAS, RHP, 20.11 - Like I wrote above, I have White as the favorite to be the #1 pitching prospect in baseball by this time next year, because he did it at High-A for most of the season, but Sykora simply didn't get that opportunity. All he could do was obliterate the competition that was put in front of him, and obliterate he did with a 2.33 ERA and 39.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 85 IP at Single-A. He's a 6'6'', 232 pound beast with 3 at least plus pitches in his mid 90's fastball, slider and splitter. He doesn't have pinpoint control, but he throws the ball over the plate, and he doesn't have the most athletic looking delivery, but it's not unathletic either. Age to level doesn't matter nearly as much for pitchers as it does hitters, but I do think it's still something to take into account, so him being 20 years old at Single-A makes me want to see it at higher levels before truly crowning him. Regardless, this is easy ace upside, and his hype is going to blow up in 2025. He's the type you might want to stick your neck out to grab if he's out there in your off-season prospect draft. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.12/225 in 185 IP

258) Kevin Gausman - TOR, RHP, 34.3 - Gausman's season had bad news written all over it right when he got popped with a shoulder injury early in Spring. He just wasn't right all season (3.83 ERA with a 21.4/7.4 K%/BB% in 181 IP), and while he was better in the 2nd half (2.90 ERA in final 90 IP), the 19.6/8.6 K%/BB% was not nearly back to prime levels, so that 2nd half does not ease my mind. The velocity was a down a half tick and the elite splitter was more good than elite. You can talk yourself into him getting healthy with a full off-season to heal, but he's 34 years old, and injuries like this are often what prompt the decline phase. His name value and track record is going to keep his value high enough where I don't think he's going to fall into my target area. If your gut is saying that this is a buy low opportunity, I 100% see why you could think that, and don't let me stop you from acting on it. But my gut is saying to not spend the still decently high price on his decline years. Not the worst buy, but just not my guy. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.69/1.20/181 in 178 IP

259) Carlos Correa - MIN, SS, 30.6 - Correa was in the midst of his first hot streak in like 6 years (I'm not even sure that is that much of an exaggeration) before going down with planter fasciitis in mid July and missing 2 months. He had smashed 11 homers in the 46 games before his injury, and after returning he hit just 1 in 11 games. He also had a .960 OPS in those 11 games, which does alleviate some of the concern over the injury in general, which is good. And he had an awesome season overall, slashing .310/.388/.517 with 14 homers, 0 steals, and a 16.6/10.9 K%/BB%. It was good for a 155 wRC+ which was the highest mark of his career. He was on the lucky side with a .358 xwOBA (still really damn good) vs. a .385 wOBA, and once again, he couldn't stay healthy. His 8.9 degree launch still says to not count on big homer totals, and he's literally a zero in stolen bases. He's only 30 years old, and he just proved he's not planning on fading into that good night anytime soon after putting up the best wRC in his career last year, so I'm not sleeping on him as a potentially good win now piece, but the injuries, low launch, and zero speed prevent me from going higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 78/22/77/.275/.354/.461/0

260) Eugenio Suarez - ARI, 3B, 33.8 - Suarez got off to a cold 1st half in 2024, but the underlying numbers were adamant that he was fine and he closed the season slashing .311/.348/.625 with 24 homers and a 25.6/5.6 K%/BB% in his final 73 games. He also improved his hit tool a bit with his BA bouncing back to .256 on the season (.232 in 2023) with a corresponding bump in K% and whiff% to back it up, but it came at the expense of his plate approach with less walks and more chase. You certainly take that tradeoff in 5x5, and it didn't hurt his OBP too much. He's a good defensive 3B and he hits both righties and lefties well, so he's a locked in true everyday guy with 158 games in 2024 and 162 games in 2023. He's not the type of upper echelon player where I wouldn't be worried at all about decline in his age 33/34 year old season, but there are no signs of it yet. He's a good win now power bat. - 2025 Projection: 76/29/92/.242/.320/.451/2

261) Brandon Lowe - TBR, 2B, 30.9 - If Lowe could stay healthy and actually play a full season, he could put up some pretty impressive numbers, but he's only stayed healthy twice in his career. Once in the shortened 2020 season where he hit 14 homers in 56 games, and then again in 2021 where he hit 39 homers in 149 games. Sure those homer totals are the top end of his ability, but he's been putting up impressive xwOBA's his entire career, including a .346 xwOBA in 2024. The 12.4% Barrel% is excellent, and the 94.1 MPH FB EV and 14.5 degree launch backs that up. He was also really good against lefties last year (.835 OPS in 72 PA) and he hasn't been that bad against them in his career (.737 OPS), so I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that he gets platooned depending on how good Tampa's other options are playing. If you want to roll the dice on his health, there could be a big power payoff. - 2025 Projection: 74/26/79/.241/.319/.471/6

262) Christopher Morel - TBR, 3B/2B, 25.9 - I'm happy I didn't know about Morel's very elite 76.1 MPH swing before this year, because I might have ended up even higher on him than I already was, and it's a reminder to not overrate bat speed, even though I do think it is a majorly valuable stat to have. Despite the elite bat speed, Morel bottomed out in 2024 with a 82 wRC+ and .196 BA in 152 games. The interesting thing is that his plate approach actually took the step forward we wanted to see with a 26.0/10.0 K%/BB% (31.0/8.4 K%/BB% in 2023), and in theory, it should have resulted in a big year. Clearly the .233 BABIP (career .277 BABIP) played a big role, but he also hit a relatively lackluster 21 homers. He got unlucky, but he also wasn't that good even with neutral luck with a .316 xwOBA (.280 wOBA). And finally he got considerably slower with a 27.3 ft/sec sprint (28.6 in 2023), which could be an indicator he was playing through an injury (he hurt his foot earlier in the year). It's still very easy to make a case to buy Morel, which is the case I made a few years ago, and those skills are still present. Namely, he hits the ball very hard. A full off-season with Tampa going into his age 25/26 year old season could easily result in a big season. Most people seem to have lost hope, and while I wouldn't call him a target, I think I want to go one more year to see what he can do. He's a let him come to you buy for a cheap price only. - 2025 Projection: 68/25/77/.235/.316/.438/10

263) Connor Norby - MIA, 3B, 24.10 - Norby's MLB debut pretty emphatically answered the question of if his profile would transfer to the majors, and that answer is yes. He ripped 9 dingers with a 14.8% Barrel% in 45 games. He does it with a lift and pull profile that put up a 33.9% GB% and 48.7% Pull%. He doesn't have big raw power, but you don't need big raw power with that profile, and the 93.6 MPH FB/LD EV looks much better than the 86.2 MPH AVG EV. The cherry on top is that he is much faster than expected with a 29.3 ft/sec sprint, and while he's not a huge base stealer (3 for 6 in his debut), he did steal 13 bags in 80 games at Triple-A, so he could easily be a 10+ guy. The downside of his profile transferring is that the rough plate approach transferred too with a 33.0/7.7 K%/BB% and 34.8% Chase%, leading to a .236 BA and .294 OBP. It's also worth mentioning that Miami is among the worst ballparks for righty homers, and since Norby doesn't have huge raw power, that could become a problem down the line, although it wasn't a problem in 2024 with 7 homers and a 1.102 OPS in Miami. He's also a bad defensive player, which puts a lot of pressure on the bat. I'm a sucker for a lift and speed profile, but he doesn't run quite enough, and there are enough other warts in his game to make me hesitant to really go all in on Norby, but there is a very exciting fantasy profile lurking in here if he can improve his plate skills and possibly get stronger too. - 2025 Projection: 77/21/71/.246/.313/.440/10

264) Xavier Edwards - MIA, SS, 25.8 - I might be scared that Edwards could easily lose his starting SS job on another team, but the Marlins have very little competition for that job at the moment. And I might be scared that he could lose his spot atop of the order, but again, the Marlins don't really have much competition for that spot either. Damn it feels good to be a 2nd division regular, and Edwards took advantage of that 2nd division with 31 steals, 39 runs, a .328 BA, and a .397 OBP in 70 games. He gets the bat on the ball with a 16.9% whiff%, he gets on base with a 10.9% BB%, and he loves to run. The reason I would be afraid of his playing time on another team, is that he's not a good defensive SS, he has nearly 0 power with 1 homer and a 1.6% Barrel%, and he got extremely lucky last year with a .359 wOBA vs. .297 xwOBA. But he's not on another team, so I have little doubt that his contact/speed/runs profile can be very valuable if you have the right offensive pieces around him to take his huge hit to your power department. - 2025 Projection: 78/4/43/.280/.340/.378/43

265) Luis Rengifo - LAA, 2B/3B, 28.1 - Rengifo's season ended on August 2nd after undergoing wrist surgery. He was in the midst of a fantasy breakout on the back of a career high by far 24 steals in just 78 games, but with a well below average 26.9 ft/sec sprint, and a previous career high of 6 steals, I don't know how many you can truly count on for 2025. The .300 BA was lucky with a .262 xBA, although the 14.5% K% was a career best, so it wasn't a complete fluke. And the rest of his profile is still lacking with a 2.5% Barrel% and .295 xwOBA. He's not good on defense either, playing a below average 2B, 3B, and SS. I'm just not buying into this, and with Christian Moore on the way (and Gleyber Torres rumors), I'm not even certain he's going to be a full time starter. He's just not one of my guys. (after writing this blurb, I looked at the objective projection I gave him, and it's not bad at all, but I'm still weary of it). - 2025 Projection: 73/15/68/.270/.324/.427/20

266) Shane Bieber - CLE, RHP, 29.10 - Bieber worked hard on increasing his velocity over last off-season in an attempt to get back to his true ace days, and he was successful with it ... at least for 2 starts. The fastball was up a tick and he put up a 0.00 ERA with a 44.4/2.2 K%/BB% in 12 IP, but the elbow simply couldn't hold up. He underwent Tommy John surgery in April which will likely keep him out until mid-season 2025. What the velocity looks like when he returns is anyone's guess, along with the breaking ball crispness and control/command. He's the type of pitcher who can be effective without huge velocity, so even if he can't get back to his ace days, there is potential for him to settle in as a plus control, mid-rotation guy throughout his 30's. He's still only 29 years old, he has an excellent track record, and he has a few different paths to remaining an impact fantasy starter. I'm not sticking my neck out for him, but there are enough positives to be intrigued by the Tommy John discount right now. - 2025 Projection: 6/3.78/1.22/97 in 100 IP

267) MacKenzie Gore - WAS, LHP, 26.1 - Here we go again. Gore is making himself comfortable in the breakout waiting room, and I just hope he doesn't end up stuck there. The good news is that he definitely took a nice step forward this season with career bests in ERA (3.90), xERA (4.19), Barrel% (6.8%), BB% (8.9%), whiff% (28.6%), and velocity (96 MPH fastball). Those are 6 major categories to take a step forward in. You can see just from those stats that the ingredients are all in here to have a true explosion in 2025, and Gore would be far from the first top of the rotation starter to take a few years before getting to that lofty level (Scherzer, Wheeler, Gausman to name a few). But it also feels like a copout to just name 3 aces who weren't as good earlier in their career as a reason to expect an explosion from Gore, and after predicting that breakout for Gore the last 2 years to mediocre results, it feels too much like wishful thinking to go too hard after it for a 3rd year. He's more of a Top 300 dynasty asset for me rather than a Top 200 one. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.82/1.34/195 in 173 IP

268) Clay Holmes - NYM, RHP, 30.4 - When I told my mom (an insanely passionate Yankees fan) that the Mets signed Clay Holmes with the intent to turn him into a starter, she just laughed and said "good luck with that." My take isn't as harsh as my mom's, as we saw the value to be had in 2024 with these reliever to starter transitions, and my instinct is to buy them. Holmes was a starter in the minors, and he put up a 30.2% whiff% in 2024, so I say why not take a shot. He put up a .662 OPS against both lefties and righties last year, his 96.6 MPH sinker should work in any role (the velocity will likely drop in a starting role, but he has some room to spare there), and his slider and sweeper are whiff machine secondaries. I'm not sure if he plans on adding more pitches this off-season, but he used to tinker with a 4-seamer, cutter, and changeup which he could bring back into the fold more. Holmes had his bumps in a bullpen role last year, losing the closer job, which is what prompted my mom's laughter, but his groundball/whiff combo is enticing, and I'm apt to buy here. I'll take a shot if the price is right for sure. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.84/1.30/142 in 140 IP Update: I was already buying and now he looks great in spring. He continues to rise

269) Luis Arraez - SDP, 1B/2B, 28.0 - If you've read me for any length of time, you know that Arraez just isn't the type of fantasy player I go after. He's a special contact hitter with an absurd 4.3% K%, which was a career best this year, and he has a career .323 BA, but the power/speed combo is just super lackluster. 4 homers with 9 steals in 150 games just isn't worth the BA bump, and neither are the 129 combined Runs and RBI. He always gets valued considerably higher than I would be willing to take him, so I never end up with him on my teams. - 2025 Projection: 84/8/51/.318/.357/.420/8

270) Luis Gil - NYY, RHP, 26.10 - Gil is a tough rank for me. I was never truly in on him as a prospect because of his extreme walk troubles, and even after his excellent rookie season (3.50 ERA with a 26.8% K% in 151.2 IP), there are still a few things holding me back from truly putting him in the young ace, or near ace tier. Most obviously, the control is still really bad with a terrible 12.1% BB%, and he was a very hot or cold pitcher because of it. I would be willing to overlook that (or at least be more forgiving of it), if he had a true dominant secondary, but he doesn't really have that with a slider that put up a good but not great .280 xwOBA and 31.5% whiff%, and a changeup that put up a solid .307 xwOBA and 26.9% whiff%. The money maker is of course the 96.6 MPH fastball that is a plus pitch with a .318 xwOBA and 28.5% whiff%. He put up a 29% whiff% overall, which is in the double plus range. I definitely feel the pull to bet on the huge stuff and whiff rates, but the well below average control, and the lack of a true whiff machine secondary makes it all feel very shaky to me. He currently has a 182 NFBC ADP, which feels about right to me, so he seems to be valued with how I see him as well. 2025 Projection: 7/3.69/1.22/102 in 90 IP Update: Suffered a lat strain which will keep him out for 3 months. I was already shaky on him, and now you can tack on injury risk on top of that

271) Jonathan India - KCR, 2B, 28.4 - India goes from one of the best offensive power ballparks in baseball to one of the worst, and I gotta say, I'm not sure I want anything to do with this. His power is not the type that can thrive in any ballpark with a 87.2/91.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, and he hits the ball in the air a fair amount with a 13.5 degree launch. He had a career .809 OPS at home vs. a .722 OPS on the road. His 19.6% K% is good, but it's not great, and he's not a huge base stealer with 13 steals in 151 games. While KC is not a good ballpark for power, they are an above average park for righties overall, so India's value might not tank, but power is king for fantasy, and it's a clear downgrade for me. The upside wasn't high to begin with, and now the floor is getting considerably lower with the ballpark switch. I'm passing on India this year. - 2025 Projection: 82/14/58/.252/.343/.402/14

272) Spencer Torkelson - DET, 1B, 25.7 - Torkelson swings a quick bat with a 73.6 MPH swing, he hits the ball hard with an 89 MPH EV, he lifts it with a 20.2 degree launch, he doesn't chase with a 23.2% Chase%, and he gets the bat on the ball with a very respectable 26.6% whiff%. I mean, that really should work as a legitimate impact power bat. And obviously he already does have one big power season under his belt with 31 homers in 159 games in 2023. He struggled hard in 2024 with only 10 homers and a 92 wRC+ in 92 games, getting sent down to the minors mid season, but when he returned to the bigs, he was much better with 6 homers and a 125 wRC+ in his final 38 games. The hit tool is definitely very shaky (.233 career BA), and he has one of the worst ballparks for righty homers, so there are reasons to have some restraint, but there are enough positive signs here to lead me to believe he is in for a bounce back 2025. The Tigers have zero interest in handing him anything after the Gleyber Torres signing, but I don't think it's out of the question for him to force his way into the lineup, maybe at the expense of Matt Vierling, Jace Jung, or gasp, Colt Keith. I'm not quite ready to give up on him, although in shallower leagues, he's tough to roster right now. - 2025 Projection: 61/22/72/.233/.312/.443/2

273) Chase DeLauter - CLE, OF, 23.6 - I don't know if DeLauter needs to stop missing leg day at the gym, or by looking at the size of those trunks, maybe he needs to skip more leg days, but he has to figure out a way to keep the gams healthy. He broke his foot pre draft in 2022 which required surgery, and then he broke that same foot this year while running the bases. This one didn't require surgery and wasn't as serious, but at 6'3'', 235 pounds, those feet are going to continue to take a beating. He was able to return from the 2nd broken foot only to have a hamstring strain end his regular season about one month later. He dominated the AFL after the season, so that also wasn't serious, but the injuries are starting to get concerning. They seemed to have stopped him from running at all this year with only 1 steal in 45 total games (although he stole 2 in 12 games in the AFL). The injuries haven't stopped him from raking though. The hit tool and plate approach look truly elite with a 13.4/11.6 K%/BB%, and he has big power with 7 homers in 36 upper minors games. One of those homers was an inside the park job, which showed off his athleticism. He's a special talent with above average to plus across the board skills, but he has to stay healthy, and staying healthy looks like it might entail not stealing a ton of bases, which does hurt the fantasy value a bit. - 2025 Projection: 16/5/19/.256/.320/.439/2 Prime Projection: 90/26/84/.278/.351/.472/11 Update: He just can't shake the injury bug. He underwent hernia surgery which could keep him out for 3 months. It's getting harder and harder to really hang on here. He's dropping

274) Lazaro Montes - SEA, OF, 20.5 - Montes has three big negatives that prevent me from ranking him even higher than this. The first is that the hit tool is a real concern with a 26.1% K% in his 1,067 PA career in the lower minors. The 2nd is that Seattle is simply an awful ballpark to hit in. And the third is that he's a very bad defensive player, and could end up DH only. That puts a ton of pressure on the bat, and as a lefty who hits righties much better than lefties, a strong side of a platoon power bat seems well within the range of outcomes. I do find it interesting that Bryce Eldridge has a nearly identical profile, and Eldridge is the darling of the prospect world while people seem lukewarm on Montes these days. I also prefer Eldridge, because the hit tool seems a bit safer, he's a true unicorn at 6'7'', and he at least seems to have found a defensive home at 1B, but Montes is right there with him. He has beastly power at 6'3'', 210 pounds with 21 homers in 116 games, he's an on base machine with a 14.4% BB%, and while the K% spiked to 29.6% when he got the call to High-A, it was starting to come down towards the end of the season, and seeing the 19.1% K% he put up at Single-A shows hope that he can improve that skill over time. He's one of the premier lower minors power hitting prospects in the game, and his hype deserves to be damn close, if not equal to Eldridge's, but the prospect world can be a fickle place. Even my ranking has a disparity between them, Maybe it's just the nature of rankings. They are imperfect. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/33/95/.246/.333/.490/4

275) Jacob Melton - HOU, OF, 24.7 - Houston's OF is nothing but opportunity right now, with not a single locked in OF starter on the roster, which means Melton is going to get all of the opportunity he can handle in the coming years. And considering how great of an athlete he is, I love the leash he is almost certain to get. He's 6'2'', 208 pounds with plus speed and above average power. He cracked 15 homers with 30 steals in 105 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The reason why I'm so excited by the opportunity and leash, is that he might need it as the hit tool and plate approach are below average with a 23.5/7.0 K%/BB%. He's also not a huge lift and pull guy, which isn't the worst thing for his type of profile (speed and hard hit ability), and it doesn't go extreme in the way direction either, so I'm not too worried about that. Is it possible he ends up a kinda fringy major leaguer who shows flashes but just doesn't have the hit/plate approach to thrive? For sure that is a very realistic outcome. But I lean upside for fantasy, which Melton has plenty of, and when you combine it with proximity and opportunity, that is a profile I want on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 21/6/24/.228/.292/.402/8 Prime Projection: 77/19/75/.248/.319/.438/24

276) Byron Buxton - MIN, OF, 31.4 - It was announced that the Twins want to limit Buxton to about 100 games in order to keep him healthy, and since that seems to be just about as many as he could play anyway, I guess that makes sense. Either way, due to choice or injuries, the limited amount of games we can back on Buxton playing holds back his fantasy value majorly. This man could have been a fantasy beast with full health, because he crushes the ball (13.2% Barrel%) in the air (19.8 degree launch) with elite speed (29.7 ft/sec sprint). The below average hit tool is his only other demerit with a 25.5/5.2 K%/BB% and 32.1% whiff%, but that is good enough to let an elite power/speed combo shine. And the injuries have prevented him from running as much as he should with just 7 steals in 102 games. Those 102 games were a 7 year high by the way. A low BA slugger with a handful steals playing in 100 games can only get ranked so high, no matter how high the upside feels. - 2025 Projection: 70/24/70/.248/.314/.491/10

277) Kyle Manzardo - CLE, 1B, 24.8 - Manzardo struggled in his first taste of the bigs, putting up a .571 OPS in his first 30 games and then got sent back down. But he was a new man when he got called up again in September, smashing 5 homers with a .873 OPS in 23 games. He carried that over into the playoffs with a 138 wRC+ in 9 games. Manzardo has average to above average raw power with a good feel to hit, strong plate approach and a lift and pull profile. He didn't really standout in any one area against major league pitching (except the lift part with a 22.1 degree launch), but he wasn't bad in any area either with a 89.2 MPH EV, 27.6% whiff% and 27.7% Chase%. Considering this was his first go around, those numbers should only improve. He isn't going to wow you with bat speed or hard hit ability, but he hits the ball often enough, and with enough power, and at the right angles to put up some very impactful fantasy seasons. He's not good on defense and he struggled vs. lefties in the majors (.566 OPS), so a strong side of a platoon role is unfortunately still on the table as a possible outcome, but I don't think he's doomed to a part time role forever as he hit lefties better in the minors. - 2025 Projection: 74/24/79/.248/.321/.447/2

278) Heston Kjerstad - BAL, 1B/OF, 26.1 - Baltimore just doesn't seem interested in the slightest to give Kjerstad a real shot. He's once again blocked after the Tyler O'Neill signing. It seems obvious they want to use him as trade bait, but I guess nobody has bitten so far (that could change as they are still on the hunt for pitching). It's a shame, because he's clearly overdo for his shot. He smoked Triple-A with 16 homers, a 26.0/12.4 K%/BB%, and a 152 wRC+ in 56 games. It came with a 90.7 MPH EV and 16.8 degree launch. And then he was really good in the majors with 4 homers, a 116 wRC+ and 90.2 MPH EV in 114 PA. The swing and miss was on the high side with a 31.3% whiff% and 28.9% K%, but neither of those are too bad, and he also chased a lot with a 35% Chase%, so he needs to refine the plate skills, but that is to be expected with such little MLB experience. He's not a great defensive player, so he's definitely going to have to rake to hold down a job, but if he doesn't rake, it doesn't matter for us anyway. I love betting on the pedigree (2nd overall pick in the draft), history of production, and hard hit ability, but without opportunity, none of it matters. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/77/.250/.328/.440/3 (this assumes he gets traded to a situation where he can compete for a full time job. If he doesn't, you can half these projections at least)

279) Kevin Alcantara - CHC, OF, 22.8 - The Forgotten Unicorn continues to fly just low enough under the radar to not have the hype explode, while continuing to perform very well and show off his truly special tools. He's a still projectable 6'6'', 188 pounds with a double plus raw power/speed combo. He put up a 91 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 29.2 ft/sec sprint in the majors. And it's not like he's struggled in the minors at all, He's actually been extremely good his entire career, never putting up a wRC+ under 123 at any stop other than when he was a 16 year old in rookie ball. This year he did it in the upper minors all season as a 21/22 year old, slashing .278/.353/.428 with 14 homers, 14 steals, and a 26.0/9.9 K%/BB% in 111 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. The cherry on top is that he's a good CF, which could make a potent OF with PCA in center and Alcantara in a corner down the line. He's not a finished product with hit tool risk and too many groundballs, but his hype should be so much higher than it is. Alcantara makes for a great upside target. 2025 Projection: 22/7/29/.229/.294/.407/6 Prime Projection: 79/23/78/.251/.328/.449/18

280) Charlie Condon - COL, 3B/1B/OF, 21.11 - Let me just start by saying that I've been valuing pro debuts extremely high from the second I started writing back in 2015/16, and it has served me extremely well in both directions (moving guys both up and down). It was back before any other outlet would even consider changing their evaluation or ranking of a player based on their pro debut. When asked, they would just hand wave it away and say something like "small sample," even though the sample was often actually bigger in pro ball than it was in their Junior year of college (back when the draft was in early June). It made no sense to me why the pro debut with wood bats and more advanced pitching wouldn't be weighed more heavily. And now, you see basically every outlet change their ranking at least somewhat based on the pro debuts, which is the right move. That brings us to Charlie Condon, who just had the type of pro debut you have nightmares over. Despite all of his pre draft hype, he did have some hit tool questions at 6'6'' with relatively high K rates throughout his college career. And the hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball with a .180 BA and 31.2/3.7 K%/BB% in 25 games at High-A. That isn't just bad, that is atrocious. Completely lost. It's not great that the only question he had coming out of the draft was immediately answered, and not in a good way. This was a 21 year old in the lower minors. You need a high FYPD college bat to dominate in the majors by like 23 years old, let alone High-A. Jacob Berry and Chase Davis were the last two hyped college bats to have poor pro debuts, and neither of their values are anywhere close to where you wanted them to be. Condon is a better prospect than both of those guys, and I'm not dropping him as far down as those guys at all, but I do believe he does deserve a real drop. This draft class was already really tightly packed at the top with a lot of really, really good college talent, but no one true standout. So based on Condon's poor debut, I don't see how it doesn't make complete sense to drop him under those guys. He has a clear carrying tool in his power, and of course I do factor in that the pro debut was at the end of a long season, draft process, new team, new coach, new everything etc ..., so he's still a Top 10 FYPD pick for me. I still like him as a power bat who will get to hit in Coors (but also gets their developmental team, and it looks like he still needs development). I just wouldn't be able to pull the trigger on him until the other similarly talented college players with better debuts were off the board first. I feel like that's reasonable. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/30/88/.241/.322/.472/8

281) Braden Montgomery - CHW, OF, 22.0 - Selected 12th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, there was a lot of talk about Montgomery dropping his righty swing to hit exclusively lefty. That doesn't really seem like what you want to hear from a highly drafted college bat, but the lefty swing is so smooth and powerful I get why it doesn't seem like that big of a deal overall. He also had a 20% K% which is substantially higher than the college bats drafted before him. Maybe that is partly why he slipped a bit to 12th overall, and also why Boston was willing to include him in the Crochet trade. The broken ankle which he suffered pre draft on June 8th was also likely a major reason for the drop. So he certainly has some risk with hit tool, platooning and injury, but he also has very major power upside. He's 6'2'', 220 pounds and he smashed 27 homers with a 1.187 OPS in 61 games in the SEC. He's been smashing homers his entire career with 62 homers in 187 games split between the Pac 12 and SEC. He absolutely destroys the baseball with huge exit velocities. That gives him a no doubt carrying tool that will make him a fantasy force. As for the trade, it really doesn't change his value at all. The path to playing time is clearer, but it's an organization downgrade and a future lineup downgrade. It's also a ballpark downgrade. If anything, it makes me like him slightly less, but again, this really shouldn't change his value too much. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/28/89/.251/.333/.475/6

282) Kevin McGonigle - DET, SS/2B, 20.7 - McGonigle had one of the best hit tools in the high school class, and while this is generally a bucket of prospect that I don't go after in first year player drafts, McGonigle showed what it looks like when that profile goes right. He slashed .309/.401/.452 with 5 homers, 22 steals, and a 8.5/14.0 K%/BB% in 74 games split between Single-A and High-A. He proved he wasn't just hit tool though, hitting the ball pretty hard with a 88.9 MPH EV at Single-A, and also showing base stealing skills (22 for 24 on the bases). He didn't have any groundball issues and he pulled the ball a lot (well over 50% pull rate). Even during the regular season I got too locked into him as a hit tool guy, when there is more to his skillset than that. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10", 187 pounds, and I still see more of a moderate power/speed combo, so I still don't mind my Stevan Kwan 2.0 comp, but McGonigle is already hitting the ball harder (and pulling the ball a lot more), so he can end up a souped up version of Kwan. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 92/15/58/291/.362/.422/21

283) Jett Williams - NYM, SS/OF, 21.5 - Jett's season was a straight disaster. He underwent surgery on his right wrist just 11 games into the season and he didn't return until the end of the August. Wrist injuries are known killers for hitters, so it's not surprising to see he wasn't great after returning from the injury either with 0 homers and a .656 OPS in 33 games on the season. I would call it a completely lost year, but if there is one small silver lining to take out of it, it's that he was actually really good in his final 6 games at Triple-A. He had a 192 wRC+ with a 89.6 MPH EV. I know it's just 6 games, but it shows how the 5'6'' Jett can truly pack a punch. He also proved the GB rates (around a 32% GB%) and the plate approach (23.6/14.9 K%/BB%) won't fall apart in the upper minors. Also keep in mind he was just 20 years old this year. Lift, speed, plate approach, and sneaky pop is a potent fantasy combination, and with Williams' injury induced down year, I'm sensing some major buy low opportunities this winter. This is an electric player, size be damned. - 2025 Projection: 16/2/10/.238/.305/.385/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/66/.264/.345/.438/32

284) Jonny Farmelo - SEA, OF, 20.7 - Farmelo was on his way to becoming a legitimate possibility for Top 20 prospect status by this off-season, but he tore his ACL on June 11th after just 46 games. It was a non contact injury while tracking a line drive to centerfield. A lot of the excitement around him was due to his double plus speed and elite athleticism, so a torn knee kinda takes a shot directly to that strength. We've also seen guys tear their knee, and then keep tearing their knee again (or tear their other knee), like Kyle Lewis, Royce Lewis, and Ronald Acuna. On the flip side, we see NFL running backs return from torn ACL's and get their explosion back, so at only 20 years old, I'm expecting Farmelo to retain most of his elite athleticism, but it's certainly not good. And the injury is also expected to keep him out until mid-season 2025. So it could be hard for him to truly get the hype fully rolling again until 2026. Even with all that, I remain high on him because his upside is no joke. He slashed .264/.398/.421 with 4 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.5/16.3 K%/BB% in 46 games at Single-A. He's 6'2'', 205 pounds with a powerful lefty swing and low groundball rates (34.1% GB%). He was thought to be on the raw side coming out of the draft, and while there is still hit tool risk, he showed a good feel to hit with an excellent approach in his debut. Assuming full health, he could be a beast, and even with the injury risk (and also the general risk of being a 19 year old in the lower minors), he should be considered a pretty sought after dynasty prospect. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 86/20/74/.256/.332/.439/30

285) Tommy Edman - LAD, OF, 29.11 - Edman is certainly not a profile I would be looking to age with on my fantasy team, but his value really isn't all that high, so I can't really call him a sell. I see him as a mostly fairly valued hit/speed combo for a win now team. He didn't debut until late August due to a wrist injury that turned into an ankle injury, and you could see the rust in multiple areas with a career worst Barrel% (3.6%), sprint speed (27.9 ft/sec), and whiff% (24%). The surface stats were still solid with 6 homers, 6 steals, and a .237 BA in only 37 games, and with a full off-season to get healthy, I don't see why he wouldn't mostly perform to career norms. Career norms is mid teens homers, upper 20's steals, and a .260 BA. Not bad. He might be a part time player in a couple years, but until that happens, I feel his profile is pretty stable. - 2025 Projection: 77/14/63/.255/.309/.405/25

286) Taylor Ward - LAA, OF, 31.4 - Ward's surface stats feel more underwhelming than they should based on the underlying numbers, but then you see his below average 69.8 MPH swing, and it all comes together. That's not to say that he's not a really good hitter, because he is a really good hitter, but that is to say just don't expect a monster season based on the 13% Barrel%, 90.9 MPH EV, and 17.4 degree launch. In 2024 it resulted in 25 homers with a .246 BA in 156 games, and while the underlying numbers said he got unlucky, I'm not so sure he actually did. - 2025 Projection: 77/24/79/.250/.327/.440/5

287) George Springer - TOR, OF, 35.6 - Springer definitely got unlucky in 2024 with a .298 wOBA vs. a .322 xwOBA, but in order the truly act on that, you would have to ignore two majors reasons to stay away. Which are that his underlying numbers are in a clear 4 year decline, and he's 35 years old. He obviously still has the potential to be put up some solid seasons as the 9.3% Barrel%, 28.1 ft/sec sprint, and 18.7% K% are all well above average, but at his age, you have to factor in the possibility of continued decline, and you also have to lower the best case outcome scenario. He's a decent win now piece, but I wouldn't consider him anything more than that. - 2025 Projection: 78/21/70/.251/.328/.429/14

288) TJ Friedl - CIN, OF, 29.7 - Friedl outperformed his underlying numbers for the 4th year in a row, which isn't surprising because the Statcast blind spot of contact/lift/pull is well known at this point, but he was only barely able to outperform them this year with a .309 wOBA vs. .292 xwOBA. It may be a Statcast blind spot, but it sure feels more precarious of a profile than the guys whose underlying numbers do match the surface stats. He was also majorly banged up all season, so that also could be to blame for the career worst 88 wRC+. He started the year with a wrist injury, he then picked up a broken thumb, and then he tacked on a hamstring injury. His speed tanked almost 2 ft/sec to a well below average 26.5 ft/sec, resulting in only 9 steals, and the BA tanked to .226 which was backed up by the .228 xBA. He still jacked out 13 homers despite a 86 MPH EV, because he has that contact (15.2% K%), lift (16.7 degree launch), pull (48.2% Pull%) profile down pat, but everything else dropped off. With a full off-season to get healthy, and a seemingly pretty good lock on a full time job (he hits both lefties and righties), Friedl could mess around and put up a 20/20 season, or something very close to it. I didn't think I was going to like him when I started this blurb, but I'm kinda liking him right now. And he's not very expensive. - 2025 Projection: 76/18/68/.252/.328/.424/22

289) Brandon Marsh - PHI, OF, 27.4 - Marsh is a platoon bat who you wouldn't want to play against lefties anyway (.552 OPS in 90 PA), and he's never posted a better than 30% K% (32.4% K% in 2024), so it's really hard to call him even the slightest bit of a true target, but he still has a really fun collection skills that I want to bet on. He crushes the ball (10% Barrel% with a 91.6 MPH EV), he's fast (28.2 ft/sec sprint), he has a great plate approach (23.7% Chase% with a 10.5% BB%), and his whiff rates really aren't that bat at all (27.5% whiff%). That's exciting. But I can't ignore that all it added up to was 16 homers, 19 steals, 55 runs and 60 RBI. That just isn't good enough to really go out of your way for. Philly isn't that deep, so Marsh's path to improvement is to get much better lefties, and if he can, the playing time should be there. - 2025 Projection: 66/18/71/.250/.330/.327/20

290) Wilyer Abreu - BOS, OF, 25.9 - Back on August 3rd, 2023, literally mere moments before Abreu went on a crazy run at Triple-A that ended up with him raking in the majors, I got this feeling about him that I just couldn't shake, naming him a target and writing, "there is something I really love about Abreu that I just can’t shake. And that something is probably his sweet, sweet lefty swing." ... and now that we have bat tracking data, I see why I just couldn't shake how much I loved his swing, and it's because not only is it smooth, but it's lightning fast with a near elite 74.6 MPH bat speed. It's no wonder he's kept on raking in the bigs right through 2024 with a 114 wRC+ in 132 games. He uses that swing to absolutely crush the ball with a 50.5% Hard Hit%, 11.1% Barrel%, 91.6 MPH EV,  and a 19.2 degree launch. It only resulted in 15 homers in 132 games, but that is so clearly on the very low end of his true talent, and he racked up 33 doubles. With that swing and batted ball data, there is zero doubt his bat is legit, but there are reasons to remain cautious. For one, he was horrible vs. lefties (.532 OPS in 67 PA), and especially with how deep Boston is, he looks like a strict platoon bat. The other big issue is the hit tool as he had a 28% K% and .229 xBA (.253 BA). The 29.6% whiff% isn't too bad, so I'm not concerned the hit tool is going to tank or anything, but it's clearly below average. He likes to run a bit with 8 steals, which isn't huge, but it's a nice little boost, and he's a really good right fielder, so his glove will certainly help keep him on the field. I would be absolutely all over him if he could hit lefties or if he was in a situation where he would get the leash to get better against them, but I don't see that in Boston. That leaves him as solid dynasty asset (Top 200-250 range), rather than a truly coveted one. 2025 Projection: 69/20/71/.251/.325/.465/9

291) Jesus Sanchez - MIA, OF, 27.5 - Sanchez has absolutely electric bat speed with a 75.2 MPH swing, and it's a short swing with a 7.1 foot length. That swing helps him demolish the ball with a 92.5 MPH EV, but unfortunately, that is just about all he does well. The 7.7 degree launch isn't high enough to take advantage of the hard hit ability, the plate approach is terrible with a 36.1% Chase% and 31.2% whiff%, he has below average speed, and he's terrible vs lefties (.485 OPS). Miami doesn't have many options, so they may play him against lefties anyway, but that's not necessarily a good thing for you. He managed to steal a career high by far 16 bases in 2024, and while that is an outlier he might not be able to keep up, at least it gives him a little added something, because without that, I would like him even less. You know I want to bet on electric bat speed and hard hit ability, but if that is literally all you do, I can't just ignore everything else. - 2025 Projection: 67/22/74/.251/.317/.438/9

292) Ceddanne Rafaela - BOS, SS/OF, 24.7 - Rafaela put up a 79 wRC+ with a .273 xwOBA (bottom 5% of baseball) in 152 games. Boston has a sea of studs on the way too. I'm starting the blurb out with that moreso as just a reminder to myself to not get too crazy here as much as I want to love Rafaela. He's a whiff and chase machine with a 33% whiff% and 46.4% Chase%. That is really, really bad. His 70.1 MPH bat speed is below average and so is his 86.6 MPH EV. He wasn't great on the bases either, going 19 for 29. Again, I'm saying this as much to myself as I am to you, but there is a very real chance, maybe a good chance, that he is just not a very good hitter. Now having said that, the power/speed combo is super fun for fantasy with an above average 7.5% Barrel%, 14.9 degree launch, and 28.8 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in 15 homers and 19 steals. He also has defensive versality, so even as a super utility player/next man up at several positions type player, that can still equal basically full time at bats over the course of the season. And he has a possibly elite CF glove, so even if they have other players that can play center, they can't play it nearly as well as Rafaela. The bat needs to take a step forward though, and I'm not so sure it's such a sure bet that it's going to happen. It might be a super utility profile on the MLB level when it's all said and done, but he's still young, and that definitely isn't the ceiling. - 2025 Projection: 71/17/74/.244/.295/.402/24

293) Trevor Story - BOS, SS, 32.5 - Story hurt his shoulder just 8 games into the season, resulting in surgery for a fractured shoulder that kept him out until early September. But he was actually pretty good still when he returned, slashing .270/.361/.429 with 2 homers, 5 steals, and a 33.3/11.1 K%/BB% in 18 games. It shows the homer/steal combo can still be very impactful, but we know it's coming with a very low batting average. He had double below average bat speed last year (probably impacted by the surgery though, so we'll see), and his K rates have been over 30% since leaving Coors. He's also struggled to stay healthy, playing in just 162 games in his 3 years with Boston. This is an oft-injured, aging profile that relies a good amount on stolen bases, so it's not one I'm really looking to buy low on in general, but for a cheap win now move, I don't hate it. He's probably pretty cheap right now and he just might be able to squeak out a 20/20+ season if things go relatively well. - 2025 Projection: 73/21/76/.228/.307/.421/23

294) Tyler Fitzgerald - SFG, SS/2B, 27.7 - I use a 20 game cutoff for these positional rankings, but with Fitzgerald set to be San Francisco's starting 2B in 2024, I'm going to include him in the 2B rankings too (I know these are the SS rankings). He had an insanely fun rookie year with 15 homers, 17 steals, and a .280 BA in 96 games, but there are so many warning signs going off, it's definitely making me hesitant to buy in too hard. The fantasy upside is undeniable with an elite 30 ft/sec sprint and 20.2 degree launch, so the power/speed numbers will be there, but the BA/OBP is a major, major risk. He put up a 31.7/6.5 K%/BB% with a 87.7/90.6 MPH AVG/FB EV. That is a recipe for a disaster batting average, especially hitting in San Francisco. The .292 xwOBA was much, much worse than the .367 wOBA. He was already starting to regress by the end of the season with a .592 OPS, 1 homer and a 36.3/6.2 K%/BB% in his final 36 games, so you can't even say the hit tool was improving as the year went on. His fantasy upside is so fun I thought I was going to like him more than I do, but there are just so many flashing red lights. - 2025 Projection: 67/21/61/.232/.298/.417/24

295) Andy Pages - LAD, OF, 24.4 - The Dodgers Giveth and The Dodgers Taketh Away. They giveth us these beautiful, ready made prospects who are perfectly developed and capable of making an immediate impact on our fantasy team ... and then they taketh them right out of the lineup and stick them on their bench, or at Triple-A. We saw it with Michael Busch. We're seeing it now with Andy Pages. And Dalton Rushing is on double deck to get the same treatment, which is why I'm maybe a hair lighter on Rushing than others. But let the record show, I was the first guy hyping Rushing based off his pro debut. You know a good pro debut doesn't slip by me ;). And while we're at it, here is a fun tweet from November 2019 where I name Andy Pages my favorite "No One Else Is On" player. Actually Jordan Rosenblum was the only other one on him (as mentioned in the tweet), and that was back before Jordan was the man behind the man of like every projection based system on the internet, hah. I even identify the prospect writer/analyst sleepers before they hit big! But enough back patting (life is short, let me celebrate my hits, will ya), let's get back to Pages' dynasty value. He set a rock solid foundation to build on in his rookie year with a 10.7% Barrel%, 88.6 MPH EV, 20.8 degree launch, 28.3 ft/sec sprint, 73.1 MPH swing, .321 xwOBA, and a 26.1% whiff% in 116 games. That is a damn good collection of skills, and not very easy to find at all. If he had a full time job, I would be all over him, but it's hard to hype a guy up who simply doesn't have a job. And even if injuries hit, he has competition to be next man up. The cream generally rises to the top, and players generally get their shot one way or another at some point, so for dynasty, I wouldn't be overly concerned about it, but I don't see how you can't factor it in. If you want to ignore playing time, Pages would be a Top 200 dynasty asset easy for me, but with the playing time concerns, I can't rank him quite that high. - 2025 Projection: 48/15/44/.244/.318/.435/3 Prime Projection: 79/26/82/.252/.333/.465/7

296) Chase Dollander - COL, RHP, 23.5 - In a Baseball America Youtube interview (The Hot Sheet Show is a great show in general), Dollander mentioned that he's literally not planning ahead at all, and doing absolutely nothing different for the looming Coors Field that awaits him. The Rockies literally don't prepare their pitchers at all for eventually pitching with different air. That makes total sense to me based on how bad their franchise is. If I was heading up a franchise where the ballpark had different air, and their entire history of pitching in that environment was nothing short of horrific, the strategies necessary to thrive in that environment would run deep throughout my organization from rookie ball on up. Dollander answered the question as if nobody has even mentioned it to him ha. I just find that kinda wild. Now, maybe trying to change who you are as a pitcher would only get in your head, and maybe there literally is no good strategy for it, so I guess you might as well not think about it. I'm open to that being the case, but either way, for fantasy purposes, it just reinforces that I'm never going to be the high guy on Colorado pitching prospects, It sure seems like if anyone can slay the beast, it will be Dollander, and as a baseball fan, I'm rooting for him hardcore to be the one who breaks through. A true ace at Coors would be awesome. If we forget about Coors for a second, Dollander is an elite pitching prospect on his own merits with a 2.59 ERA and 33.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 118 IP at High-A and Double-A (he was equally dominant at both stops). The mid to upper 90's fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon, which he combines with a 3 secondaries (gyro slider, curve, change) that aren't as good as the fastball, but can be above average to plus pitches in their own right. Below average control is the only other demerit besides Coors Field. I've had a zero tolerance policy for Coors pitching prospects my entire life, and it has yet to come back to bite me. Maybe Dollander will be the one to finally make me regret it, and I'm genuinely rooting for him to be the one, even if it won't happen on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 4/4.28/1.33/96 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.79/1.24/185 in 170 IP

297) Brandon Sproat - NYM, RHP, 24.6 - Baseball likes to make it as hard as possible to evaluate minor league players, and pitchers in particular. They love to use minor leaguers as guinea pigs, which I get, but life would be a lot easier if things were at least a bit more standardized among all levels. There was literally different rules for calling balls and strikes at Triple-A in the first 3 games of a series (fully automated) vs. the last 3 (umps call it with a automated challenge system). Then they switched the rules mid-season to just the automated challenge system with the umps calling them the rest of the time. Every level also uses different balls. Triple-A uses the MLB ball, while lower levels don't. Enter Brandon Sproat, who utterly dominated at Double-A with a 2.45 ERA and 33.2/6.5 K%/BB% in 62.1 IP, only to completely fall apart at Triple-A with a 7.53 ERA and 16.3/8.5 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP. Was it the ball? Was it the strikezone? Was it the better competition? Was it that he was reaching a career high in IP? Was it a combo of everything? I don't know exactly, but what I do know is that the stuff was still nasty. The 4-seamer sits 96.6 MPH and he has 2 potentially plus secondaries in his slider and changeup which both miss bats and induce weak contact. He also throws a cutter, curve and sinker, giving him a very diverse pitch mix. His control was below average throughout his college career, and it also was poor at the start of the season at High-A, so there is still some control/command risk in here even though he took a big step forward in that department overall. Does it worry me a bit that his numbers tanked so hard when he used the MLB baseball for the first time? It does. But at the end of the day the stuff don't lie, and Sproat has monster stuff. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.08/1.32/87 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.63/1.20/189 in 170 IP

298) Tyler Stephenson - CIN, C, 28.8 - The 6'4'', 225 pound Stephenson was the former 11th overall pick in the 2015 Draft, and he finally had that power breakout that I feel we've been waiting for forever, jacking a career high by far 19 homers in 138 games. It also came with a career high 90.2/95.2 MPH AVG/FB EV to back up the surface stats. He's always had a good hit tool and plate approach (22.7/9.3 K%/BB%), so the power uptick was all he needed. I've said it a few times in these rankings, but catchers taking longer to breakout offensively is the norm, so I do think he can maintain this level over the next few seasons. He finished as the 8th overall catcher in 2024, and it sure seems like that could be on the rise in future years. - 2025 Projection: 71/19/69/.261/.335/.434/1

299) Austin Wells - NYY, C, 25.9 - Let's start with the fact that Wells was an excellent defensive catcher, ranking 5th best in baseball according to Fangraphs. His defense was a question coming up in the system, so seeing that is a big deal for his ability to stick at catcher, which is now a foregone conclusion. But it's offense we care the most about, and while Wells didn't exactly dominate with a .229 BA and 13 homers in 115 games, there are plenty of positive takeaways. It was his rookie year and he put up an above average 105 wRC+. That is a really strong foundation, and he also underperformed his underlying numbers with a .339 xwOBA vs. .315 wOBA. He hit the ball hard enough with a 88.4 MPH EV, he lifted it with a 17.1 degree launch, and he showed strong plate skills with a 21.0/11.4 K%/BB%. With the short porch at Yankees Stadium, that is just begging for some big homer totals in future years. Wells is setting up to be a really good fantasy catcher for a long time. - 2025 Projection: 63/20/71/.243/.336/.440/3

300) Gabriel Moreno - ARI, C, 25.2 - I was always low on Moreno and didn't buy the playoff homer binge, and that proved correct as he had a very lackluster fantasy season. He hit .266 with just 5 homers in 97 games. He put up a 107 wRC+ on the back of an excellent 14.8/11.7 K%/BB%, and he's a good defensive player, so there is a reason he was ranked highly on real lift prospect lists, but for fantasy, I just didn't see that next level appeal. It's not like I hated him, and I still don't hate him now. He hits the ball hard with a 90 MPH EV, but even with a career high 8.8 degree launch, a 92.7 MPH FB/LD EV is just not going to result in a bunch of homers. He should be a good fantasy catcher for a long time, but he's not likely to be a next level one. - 2025 Projection: 58/13/66/.278/.346/.415/6

301) Drew Rasmussen - TBR, RHP, 29.8 - Rasmussen returned from internal brace procedure in August, and he looked as filthy as ever, if not filthier. He put up a 2.83 ERA with a 30.2/5.2 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP over 16 outings. All 4 of his pitches were straight dominant (4-seamer, sinker, cutter, sweeper), missing bats (31.4% whiff%) and keeping the ball on the ground (6.6 degree launch). The velocity was huge with a 97.4 MPH 4-seamer leading the way, and the control was double plus. He never went more than 2 IP, so you can't count on him being that good in the rotation, and there is no guarantee that he currently has a rotation spot. It seems at this point he might not, and even if he does win one, we might be looking at a 4-5 IP guy. I love to chase upside, and Rasmussen is so enticing, but I do think some caution is warranted just based on expected innings. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.41/1.13/129 in 125 IP

302) Noelvi Marte - CIN, 3B, 23.6 - Marte got popped for an 80 game PED suspension in March, which shocked the prospect and baseball world. My first instinct isn't to just drop talented players down the rankings when they get popped for PED's, but when Marte returned mid-season, he did everything in his power to prove he was actually cheating. Everything got much worse from his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 46 wRC+ in 242 PA, which was the 6th worst mark in baseball (min 240 PA). Only Tim Anderson, Brandon Drury, Javier Baez, Dominic Fletcher and Eddie Rosario were worse. He got slower with his home plate to 1B runtime dropping from 4.3 to 4.43. His EV dropped from 91.3 MPH to 87 MPH. His Chase% jumped from 28.6% to 37.1%. His K% jumped from 20.3% to 31%. He was also terrible on defense, leading to a negative 1.5 WAR on the season. He was quite simply one of the very worst players in baseball. It's possible that the horrific season wasn't purely because he wasn't on the juice anymore. It's certainly possible that the suspension threw off his entire season both mentally and physically. An entire off-season to regroup should be a big help towards bouncing back in 2025. I'm not giving up on him at all, but I do think there has to be a major penalty for the possibility he was in fact cheating. I know everyone, including me, kinda brushes off the PED thing nowadays, but guys can still genuinely cheat, right? It also seems that he is in Cincinnati's doghouse, and that he is going to have to earn every future opportunity he will get. I just can't go higher than this on him. - 2025 Projection: 36/8/31/.240/.300/.403/11 Prime Projection: 76/18/71/.252/.320/.427/21 Update: He still looks awful this spring and was sent down. I'm getting nervous

303) Ryan Jeffers - MIN, C, 27.10 - Jeffers robbed Peter to pay Paul in 2024, bringing his K rate down to a career best by far 20.2% (27.8% in 2023), but his exit velocity tanked with it to a career low by far 86.9 MPH (90.5 MPH in 2024). His walk rate tanked too with a 6.9% BB% (9.9% in 2023). With how much he hits the ball in the air (16.9 degree launch), he couldn't even take advantage of the better contact rates with a .226 BA and 21 homers in 122 games. It's interesting that he kinda ended up with the same numbers he likely would have ended up with anyway had he just kept the same profile from 2023, except with a lower OBP. All roads seem to lead to mostly the same place for Jeffers. Which is as a low BA slugger. - 2025 Projection: 63/23/72/.240/.316/.440/3

304) Nick Castellanos - PHI, OF, 33.1 - Castellanos basically has the recipe for a guy you don't want to buy the decline years on. He chases a ton with a 37.8% Chase% and he whiffs a ton with a 30.1% whiff%. We've actually already seen the decline once he hit 30 years old, putting up a 95, 109, and 105 wRC+ over the last 3 years. He was a 120+ guy in his prime more or less. And his bat speed is only slightly above average at 71.9 MPH, so you can't even fall back on electric bat speed. Following a normal decline curve, it seems to me he can level down yet again in his age 33+ seasons, and considering he's a terrible defensive player, he's just not a guy I'm looking to own in his mid 30's. Having said that, the skills haven't fallen off a cliff yet with a .333 xOBA, so I do think he can be a solid hitter in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 76/24/83/.258/.311/.448/6

305) Jurickson Profar - ATL, OF, 33.1 - By golly, it took 14 years, but Profar finally had that superstar breakout we all thought was possible back when he was an elite prospect (and #1 overall like everywhere in 2013). If you took him in your 2010 First Year Player Draft, you must be pretty damn happy right now. It finally paid off ;). He had that classic year 32 power breakout with a career high by a mile 91.1 MPH EV (87.3 MPH was his previous career high). Just how we drew it up. The plus contact and plus approach didn't take a step back at all either, so it was a full on blow up season, and he kept it up all year with 24 homers, 10 steals, 94 Runs, 84 RBI and a .280/.380 BA/OBP. The 139 wRC+ was elite. I'm not in the business of paying up for career years at 32 years old, so there is just no way I can see myself paying up for Profar, but it's not like anything he did was lucky. He just got magically INSANELY stronger 12 years into his career. And he did it during an off-season where he was a free agent and nobody really wanted him. His career was almost over. He had nothing to lose. Totally normal. - 2025 Projection: 82/18/69/.266/.339/.430/8

306) Nolan Arenado - STL, 3B, 33.11 - The Cards are trying to trade Arenado, but he pulled a card of his own, the full no trade clause card. He rejected a trade to Houston. It seems he has about 6 teams he wants to go to, with the Dodgers seemingly the one he's pushing for (all just based on rumors). At this point of the off-season, this could very well go into the season. He's a shell of his former self, bottoming out in 2024 with a career low 86.3 MPH EV and .296 xwOBA. The contact rates are still excellent with a 14.5% K%, he can still lift and pull, his speed was the same (slow, but the same), and his defense was still excellent, so it might have been just a down year rather than the start of the cliff. Or at least it was a combo of both, so I would expect a power bounce back in 2025 (only 16 homers in 152 games). The Cards were also the 9th worst park for righty homers, and based on his preferred destinations, he will almost certainly get a ballpark bump if a trade does happen. I actually don't hate him as a buy low win now option if his name value doesn't inflate his price too much. - 2025 Projection: 75/24/83/.269/.322/.441/3

307) Yandy Diaz - TBR, 1B, 33.8 - Yandy was unsurprisingly unable to keep up his career high 22 homers in 2023 with it dropping back down to 14 homers in 145 games in 2024. When you have a 5 degree launch, literally everything has to go perfectly, and all the stars have to align to put up impactful homer seasons. He crushes the ball with a 92.2 MPH EV, he makes tons of contact with a 15.3% K%, and he gets on base with a career 11.3% BB%, but he has a bottom 10% of the league sprint speed, so he really can't even take full advantage of those skills. And now he's officially in his old man years at 33/34 in 2025. The upside isn't really that high to begin with, BA first plays are not my thing, he's not good on defense, he provides 0 steals, and I really don't want to be the one left holding the bag here. Diaz isn't someone I'm going to own anywhere, but he can definitely still be solid for a win now team. - 2025 Projection: 80/15/75/.284/.361/.438/1

308) Cody Bradford - TEX, LHP, 27.1 - Bradford was a victim of low velocity pitchers getting no respect (I am fully guilty of this as well), but low velocity pitchers are starting to get their due more and more, and Bradford is another example of why the discrimination needs to end. The fastball only sat 89.8 MPH, but it was tied for the 21st most valuable 4-seamer in baseball with a +11 Run Value. One of the pitchers he was tied with was Mason Miller and his 100.9 MPH fastball. And Bradford's fastball was better on a per pitch basis than Miller's. Just really fun to think about that disparity in velocity with about the same effectiveness. He combines the plus fastball with an above average changeup that notched a 33.8% whiff%, and he also mixes in a curve, slider, and cutter. He has elite control over the entire arsenal. It resulted in a 3.54 xERA with a 22.7/4.2 K%/BB% in 76.1 IP, and the 3.54 xERA perfectly backs up the surface stats. He gets hit relatively hard with a 8.9% Barrel% against, so I don't think the upside is very high, but nothing he did in 2024 was a fluke either. He looks like a low WHIP, mid rotation fantasy starter. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.72/1.15/140 in 150 IP

309) Ranger Suarez - PHI, LHP, 29.7 - Suarez is basically the textbook definition of "mid-rotation" starter. He doesn't really standout in any one area, but he's solid across the board. He has a career 3.42 ERA with a 21.8/7.9 K%/BB% in 604.2 IP. He doesn't rack up innings (155.1 IP is a career high) and he doesn't rack up strikeouts, but you can be pretty confident when you throw him out there that he'll put together a solid outing for you. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.65/1.27/145 in 150 IP

310) Nestor Cortes - MIL, LHP, 30.3 - Cortes put up a career high 174.1 IP, which is great to see because durability has really been his biggest issue. When he's on the mound, he's a solid mid rotation starter with a plus control (5.5% BB%) and average whiff rates (24.2% whiff%). He gets it done by pounding the zone with a fastball heavy approach. He went to the 92.1 MPH 4-seamer 44.2% of the time, and it's at least a plus pitch with a 7 Run Value and 21.5% whiff%. The second most used pitch is the cutter with a 28% usage rate and +5 Run Value. Nothing flashy. Just solid. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.72/1.19/158 in 160 IP

311) Jose Berrios - TOR, RHP, 30.10 - Berrios massively outperformed his underlying numbers for the 2nd year in a row with a 3.60 ERA and 19.5/6.9 K%/BB% in 192.1 IP vs. 4.74 xERA. He put up a 3.65 ERA vs. a 4.51 xERA in 2023. He's actually pretty considerably outperformed his underlying numbers in 5 of his last 6 years, so it's obviously skill, but I'm still really hesitant to buy too hard into it. None of his pitches are really standout or miss a ton of bats, although sinker performed extremely well in 2024 with a +12 Run Value. He's proven he can be a solid mid-rotation fantasy starter, but his really good ERA's are going to push his price up too high for me. He's just not one of my guys. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.88/1.20/165 in 185 IP

312) Tobias Myers - MIL, RHP, 26.8 - Myers doesn't do anything flashy, and there is no one area of his game that really stands out, but when you add up the sum of his parts, you realize he's a really interesting young starter to say the least. The fastball only sits 92.9 MPH, but it gets really good movement and it was a pretty good pitch with a +6 run value that ranked 58th in all of baseball. He only went to the changeup 11.4% of the time, but it was elite when he went to it (mostly vs. lefties) with a 44.4% whiff% and .194 xwOBA, and the slider induced weak contact with a .194 xwOBA. He also threw a cutter and mixed in a changeup. Tack on above average to plus control, and you have a really good pitcher which resulted in a 3.00 ERA with a 22.3/6.3 K%/BB% in 138 IP. The xERA sat 4.11, so he definitely got on the lucky side, and his stuff isn't exactly unhittable with a 89.7 MPH EV against, so we might not be talking about huge upside, but I really like Myers a lot, especially if he doesn't get any respect this off-season. He's a "let him come to you" target for me this off-season, meaning don't reach, but definitely put a star next to his name as you get deeper into the draft. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.76/1.23/158 in 165 IP

313) Grant Holmes - ATL, RHP, 29.0 - It sure seems like Holmes is the favorite for a rotation spot right now, and that makes me damn excited. I went full 5 alarm target on him during the season when they gave him a shot in the rotation, and it looks like scooping him up is about the pay off in a major way in 2025. He checks a ton of boxed for what I look for in a pitching prospect breakout. The control is double plus with a 5.3% BB%, the whiff% is elite with a 32.4% whiff%, the 94.5 MPH fastball is a good pitch with a .299 xwOBA and 20.3% whiff%, and he has two bat missing secondaries in his slider (41.5% whiff%), and curve (43.7% whiff%). It all led to a 3.56 ERA with a 24.8/5.3 K%/BB% in 68.1 IP. Most of it came in a bullpen role, but he got multiple longer outings in there where he proved it will translate to the rotation. He might be my #1 pitching prospect target in 2025. If you didn't already get him last off-season, now is the time to strike. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.68/1.22/150 in 145 IP

314) Seth Lugo - KCR, RHP, 35.4 - Lugo should have been starting for the Mets for years now, but they made the head scratching decision to leave him in the pen. When he got unleashed in the rotation in 2023 after getting out of New York, he has unsurprisingly done nothing but thrive. He put up a 3.00 ERA with a 21.7/5.7 K%/BB% in 206.2 IP. I trust the 3.75 xERA more than the ERA, but the plus control profile of a 9 pitch mix (!!!) is clearly legit. The guy knows how to pitch. He's 35 years old and he doesn't put up the K numbers we love to see for fantasy, so he's still not really a super highly sought after asset for me. - 2025 Projection: 13/3.69/1.19/160 in 180 IP

315) Luis Severino - OAK, RHP, 31.1 - The days of Severino being an ace or near ace are clearly over, but it was nice to see him stabilize his career as a #3/4 type after a disastrous 2023. He put up a 3.91 ERA with a 21.2/7.9 K%/BB% in 182 IP. He still throws gas with a 96.2 MPH fastball that was a good pitch too with a .292 xwOBA and 21.8% whiff%. The sweeper was excellent with a .217 xwOBA and 38.6% whiff%, the sinker put up a +6 Run Value, and he throws a 6 pitch mix. That is plenty of positive attributes to like there. He's a rock solid mid-rotation starter. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.85/1.26/160 in 170 IP

316) Sean Murphy - ATL, C, 30.6 - Murphy missed two month right at the beginning of the season with an oblique injury, and it's an easy thing to point to for what led to a down season. He put up a career worst 78 wRC+ in 72 games. All of the the underlying power metric were considerably down. He has a long enough track record to say it is highly likely he will have a major bounce back in 2024 to get back to career normal levels, which is about a .250 hitter with 20 homers. Travis d'Arnaud leaving town will also help his playing time, and while Drake Baldwin is knocking on the door, he's a rookie who isn't necessarily the best defensive catcher, so I don't think he will be a major threat if Murphy is playing well. Or at least not as much of a threat as d'Arnaud. Muphy should get back to being a good fantasy catcher in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 59/16/63/.246/.337/.431/1 Update: Cracked rib will keep him out until mid April at the earliest, which could allow Baldwin to stake claim to some of that catcher job

317) Sean Manaea - NYM, LHP, 33.2 - Manaea put together an excellent season in 2024 with a 3.47 ERA in 181.2 IP, but that is pretty clearly the very high end of his ability. His 24.9/8.5 K%/BB% is right in line with career norms over the last several years, and the 3.75 xERA is likely more in line with his true talent level. There are a couple things to point to though as to why it could be real, or at least semi real. He went to the sweeper more than he ever has, making it his most used secondary, and he dominated with the pitch (.219 xwOBA with a 38.8% whiff%). He also swapped out his 4-seamer with his sinker as his most used fastball. And he added in a cutter this year which was a plus 2 Run Value pitch. I'm still not fully buying the great year, but I am buying that the leveling up was partially real. It's hard to act on it too hard at 33 years old, but Manaea looks like a rock solid #3 starter with maybe a hair upside for better. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.78/1.20/146 in 145 IP Update: Suffered an oblique injury and will start the year on the IL. Obliques are known to linger, so he gets a very small ding

318) Brandon Woodruff - MIL, RHP, 32.1 - Woodruff will be returning from October 2023 shoulder surgery that kept him out for all of 2024, and it's anyone's guess just how healthy he is going to be. He's been throwing bullpens and is having a relatively normal off-season routine, but not even he knows how he will look as he starts truly ramping up for the season until he goes out there and does it. We know he's a true ace when healthy, but I think truly expecting full health is on the wishful thinking side. You have to factor in some rust at the very least, and probably a diminished version of himself is most realistic. His upside is high enough to take the shot at this point in the rankings, but I would hesitate to pay up much higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.71/1.20/143 in 140 IP

319) Kyle Bradish - BAL, RHP, 28.7 - Bradish underwent Tommy John surgery with an internal brace procedure in June, which will likely keep him out until the 2nd half of 2025 at the very best, and will more likely wipeout his entire season. He started the year on the IL with a UCL sprain, so the writing was already on the wall, but when he did pitch in 2024, he showed the type of upside you want to see in order to take the TJ discount. He put up a 2.75 ERA with a 32.5/9.2 K%/BB% in 39.1 IP. The sinker sat 95.3 MPH, the secondaries miss bats, and he keeps the ball on the ground. Assuming full health, he was locking in his status as a strong #2, but we'll see how healthy he is upon his return. - 2025 Projection: OUT

320) Tanner Scott - LAD, Closer Committee, 30.8 - Scott signed a 4 year, $72 million contract with the Dodgers, and they just announced he is going to get the bulk of their saves. But that really only means he's going to get the first shot at it, maybe, and because he's a lefty, it seems unlikely that he will truly lock in the full time role. He also still has control issues with a 12.2% BB% in 72 IP, which is another reason I would hesitate to trust him to truly rack up saves. He's damn good with a 1.75 ERA and 28.6% K% on the back of a truly elite 97.8 MPH fastball and plus slider. But even with the endorsement, I can't go any higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.01/1.17/77/22 saves in 66 IP

321) Otto Lopez - MIA, 2B, 26.4 - I love it when I think I'm going to be lukewarm on a player, and then after really diving in, I realize I like him more than I thought I would. That's Lopez for me, and I'm kinda liking him a lot right now. He got his first real shot at the majors in 2024, and he played well enough to seemingly lock down Miami's starting 2B job. He has a strong contact/speed/defense combo that transferred to the majors with a 17.3% K%, .270 BA, 20 steals (28.7 ft/sec sprint), a 12.2 defensive value and 6 homers in 117 games. But the thing that makes me like him so much, is that he hits the ball damn hard for this type of profile. He put up a 88/93.1 MPH AVG/FB EV in the majors, and he had a 92.2 MPH EV in 12 games at Triple-A. He didn't hit the ball nearly this hard in 2023, but it seems to me he might have had a true raw power uptick in his age 25 year old season. The 5.4 degree launch is low, so he's not going to have some big homer power breakout, but it's a recipe for a high batting average, which he's had his entire career. He struggled vs lefties and he doesn't walk a lot (5.8% BB%), so it's likely a bottom of the order profile on most days. I'm not saying I see some big breakout coming, but if you miss out on the more hyped contact/speed/defense plays (Hoerner, Stott, Gimenez etc), Lopez could quite frankly equal their production at a fraction of the cost. - 2025 Projection: 76/10/61/.275/.321/.398/25

322) Ryan Mountcastle - BAL, 1B, 28.1 - Baltimore moving the LF fences back in somewhat will be a major benefit to Mountcastle after his homer totals tanked to 13 in 124 games in 2024, but he still doesn't really have the profile to fully take advantage of it with a 10.4 degree launch and 27.9% Pull%. Those numbers were much better earlier in his career before they moved the fences back, so maybe he goes back to lifting and pulling more. He definitely has the hard hit ability to take advantage if he does with a 45.2% Hard Hit% and 90.8 MPH EV. It's not just the fences though, he also has major competition for his job, so the leash is going to be very short, and his lack of defensive value and low OBP isn't going to help there. I was 100% out on Mountcastle before the fence news, and while I'm still not going after him, he's at least a bit more interesting now. - 2025 Projection: 66/22/78/.268/.318/.446/3

323) Luisangel Acuna - NYM, SS/2B, 23.1 - Acuna was in the midst of an extremely lackluster season at Triple-A with a 69 wRC+ in 131 games, but maybe he was just getting bored, because he gave his dynasty value a shot to the arm in his cup of coffee in the bigs. He jacked out 3 homers with a 91 MPH EV, 15% K% and 165 wRC+ in 40 PA. He might not be as good as his older brother, but the electric Acuna blood most certainly runs through his veins with a near elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed and a plus 73.5 MPH bat speed. He's only 5'10'', and the 87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A wasn't as impressive, but there is real juice in his bat, especially as he continues to get stronger. He's a game changer on the bases with 40 steals at Triple-A, and he's put up strong contact rates at every level, including the majors. He only had a 2.5% BB% in the majors, but he really didn't chase a concerning amount with a 30.8% Chase%. The Mets are a wild card this off-season, so I hesitate to try to project their lineup right now, but he can play SS, 2B, and CF, which means he can basically play any position on the field, so that versality will keep his bat in the lineup if he's producing. He looks like a mighty enticing dynasty asset right now. - 2025 Projection: 73/12/61/.256/.309/.394/23 Prime Projection: 84/16/69/.272/.328/.426/30

324) Zach Dezenzo - HOU, 1B, 24.11 - Houston is planning on using Dezenzo at 1B and LF in 2025, which works just fine because Houston has nothing but opportunity in their OF. He also has an offensive profile that I am super excited about. He's going to have to earn it every step of the way, so he's not the type of target I am going to stick my neck out for, but he is 100% a "let him come to you" target for me. He's 6'5'', 220 pounds with an elite 75.4 MPH swing and a well above average 28.3 ft/sec sprint. We are talking about an absolutely elite, electric athlete here. He wasn't great in his MLB debut with a 33.8/4.6 K%/BB% and 84 wRC+ in 19 games, so the hit tool is definitely a risk, but his 31.7% whiff% wasn't too bad, and he dominated Triple-A with a 149 wRC+ and 22.1/13.3 K%/BB% in 25 games. I'm willing to take on that extra risk for the type of athlete he is. Don't reach, but definitely put a big star next to Dezenzo's name and hope he falls right into your lap. 2025 Projection: 62/15/69/.248/.312/.422/9 Prime Projection: 83/20/79/.262/.337/.444/15

325) Ronny Mauricio - NYM, 2B, 24.0 - I'm fighting off the prospect creep of "out of sight, out of mind," because even when you are aware of that mind virus, it can still take a hold of you. Mauricio missed all of 2024 after undergoing surgery for a torn ACL that he suffered after a non contact injury on the bases in Winter Ball. It was deju vu all over again with Edwin Diaz tearing his knee in the WBC the off-season before that, but Diaz came back to basically full strength this season, and Mauricio can do the same in 2025. He hit the ball very hard with a 90.7 MPH EV in 26 games in the majors and a 91.1 MPH EV at Triple-A, he loves to run with 7 steals in the majors and 24 steals at Triple-A, and he gets the bat on the ball with a 18.2% K% at Triple-A. That K% jumped to 28.7% in the majors, he chases a ton, he hits the ball on the ground a lot and despite loving to run, he's not a burner. He doesn't really have the speed to lose, so the knee injury is definitely concerning in the stolen base department at the least.. I definitely have the pull to drop him down the rankings, but I'm fighting it with everything I have, because at full strength, Mauricio has a very fantasy friendly skillset. - 2025 Projection: 37/10/46/.248/.304/.419/8 Prime Projection: 75/22/77/.267/.325/.454/16

326) Spencer Jones - NYY, OF, 23.11 - Extremely high strikeout rate hitters often straddle that imaginary line between "he'll hit enough for the huge talent to blow up" and "he can't hit, making the huge talent worthless." It often results in a very black or white ranking, because if you think they will hit enough, they get ranked extremely high, and if you don't think they will hit enough, you might erase them completely from your rankings. I like to live in the Grey (not Grey as in Razzball Grey, that would just be odd, but Grey as in the Queen's English of gray), so while I'm obviously less than enthused with Jones' 36.8% K% in 122 games at Double-A, I don't want to just banish him to purgatory. His talent is just too huge to do that at 6'6'', 235 pounds with an at least plus power/speed combo. And even with all of the strikeouts, he still showed out in the upper minors with 17 homers, 25 steals, and a 124 wRC+. He doesn't have to bring the K rate down to like the mid 20's, he can survive in the low 30's. Jones isn't Elly, but we saw the season Elly just put up with a 31.3% K%. The extremely high K rate rate definitely hurts his value (at least he's no Elijah Green and his 44% K%), but I don't think it means you should write him off. The upside is too high, and I don't think the hit tool is hopeless. He's still a Top 75 Prospect for me. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.217/.290/.399/4 Prime Projection: 75/21/79/.238/.317/.436/21

327) Mitch Keller - PIT, RHP, 29.0 - There was some hope that Keller could maybe be that classic case of an elite pitching prospect taking until their mid to late 20's before really breaking out, but at this point, that hope is super minimal. He just doesn't miss enough bats to think he's anything else than who he's been, which is a #3/4 starter. He put up an underwhelming 21.5% whiff% in 2024, and none of his pitches put up an over 30% whiff%. The one positive takeaway is that he proved the control gains he made in 2023 were real with a 6.5% BB% in 2024, but it only resulted in a 4.25 ERA and 21.5/6.5 K%/BB% in 178 IP. He's fine. - 2025 Projection: 11/4.09/1.28/174 in 180 IP

328) Kutter Crawford - BOS, RHP, 29.0 - Crawford was a popular breakout pick last off-season, and it looked like he was going full breakout with a 2.17 ERA in his first 58 IP, but he was wasn't able to maintain it, settling in as more of a #4 type starter by the end of the season with a 4.36 ERA and 23.1/6.7 K%/BB% in 183.2 IP. He has plus control of an about average 5 pitch mix. The true standout pitch is the splitter he's been developing, and while he rarely goes to it (8.6% usage), it's his best pitch when he does with a .215 xwOBA and 40.4% whiff%. If he can incorporate that pitch more and continue to refine it, that could give him a true put away weapon that he's lacking right now. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.92/1.16/150 in 155 IP

329) Brayan Bello - BOS, RHP, 25.10 - You can only hang out in the breakout waiting room for so long before you start to wear out your welcome, and I think Bello has more or less reached that point. He had another underwhelming season with a 4.49 ERA and 21.8/9.1 K%/BB% in 162.1 IP. All of the things I've loved about him over the past few years are still there with velocity (95.7 MPH sinker), groundballs (50.8% GB%), and an excellent changeup (36.9% whiff%), but it's only resulted in mediocre results, and it seems silly to keep betting on a big breakout at this point. He even improved his slider this year, and it still didn't really make a huge impact on the overall line. He's only 25 and plenty of talented pitchers took several years before a big breakout, but plenty of similarly talented pitchers also never break out and remain a #4 type starter, so I think it's time we stop reaching for it. I still like him and have no problem drafting him, but make sure it's for a pretty low price. - 2025 Projection: 11/4.13/1.31/159 in 165 IP

330) Kris Bubic - KCR, LHP, 27.7 - Bubic returned from Tommy John surgery in a bullpen role, and he thrived with a 2.67 ERA and 32.2/4.1 K%/BB% in 30.1 IP. KC is moving him back into the rotation, and with the K/BB he just put up in 2024, regardless of role, I'm interested. I'm a simple man. The 30.5% whiff% backs up the K rate somewhat, and all 3 of his pitches missed plenty of bats. The 93 MPH fastball in particular was dynamite with an elite 34.7% whiff%. His slider put up a .197 xwOBA and the changeup put up a .194 xwOBA with a 34.1% whiff%. His control took a big step forward, and while it was in a bullpen role, it was so good that you have to hope at least some of it was real. He was terrible as a starter earlier in his career, so I would tread a bit carefully, but overall, I'm in. I think I'm kinda targeting him. Why not, it's not like he's getting too much hype right now. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.89/1.23/130 in 130 IP

331) Cade Horton - CHC, RHP, 23.7 - Horton's season ended after just 34.1 IP with a lat strain, and let's hope that lat strain is what led to his terrible run at Triple-A. He put up a 7.50 ERA with a 27.2/13.6 K%/BB% in 18 IP. The fastball was down to 94.1 MPH. The good news is that the secondaries (changeup, curve, slider) still missed a ton of bats and induced weak contact, and he also pitched much better at Double-A with a 1.10 ERA and 29.0/3.2 K%/BB% in 16.1 IP. We can give him a pass for his performance at Triple-A due to the injury, but Tommy John surgery knocked out his entire 2021 season, so injuries are starting to become a concern. He's never pitched more than 88.1 IP in a season, so it's a question if he can truly put up a full starter's workload year after year, and also what level of stuff he can hold over those innings. His value took a hit this year, but it would be too risk averse to completely tank his value. I'm holding relatively strong. 2025 Projection: 4/4.13/1.32/74 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.68/1.19/163 in 150 IP

332) Moises Ballesteros - CHC, C, 21.5 - Ballesteros is a below average defensive catcher which makes it unclear if he will end up sticking behind the plate. He's only 21 years old, so maybe he'll improve, and maybe Chicago will be fine with his below average defense because they are not strong at catcher in both the majors and the minors. Even if Ballesteros moves off catcher to 1B/DH, he definitely has the bat to clear that high bar. He possesses one of the best hit/power combos in the minors, slashing .289/.354/.471 with 19 homers, 1 steal, and a 18.3/8.9 K%/BB% in 124 games split between Double-A (154 wRC+) and Triple-A (106 wRC+). And keep in mind he did that as a 20 year old. He started to lift and pull the ball more at Triple-A, which spiked his K rate a bit, but we'll take that tradeoff for more dingers. Lack of defensive value can certainly end up a real issue if his bat ends up more above average than great, but Chicago has every incentive for him to stick behind the plate, so I'm leaning he gets a real shot there. - 2025 Projection: 33/9/39/.258/.307/.420/1 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.275/.332/.450/2

333) Colson Montgomery - CHW, SS, 23.1 - Montgomery had a pretty damn bad season at Triple-A with 18 homers, an 85.8 MPH EV, a 28.6/12.0 K%/BB% and an 88 wRC+ in 130 games. I've talked about this in a previous year's Strategy Section, but it's easy to assume every down year for a prospect is him regressing as a player, and every monster year is a true breakout, rather than it sometimes just being a down year or a career year. So even though I was a bit lower than most last year on Montgomery, writing, "Those are the reasons that make me hesitant to rank him as high as I see him in other places, but there is no denying he is a damn good prospect no matter how you slice it," I'm still not going to jump ship. His profile remains the same for me as a 6'3'', 225 pound slugger with a clear path to playing time. He also came into the AFL fired up to wash the slate clean with 3 homers, a 6/10 K/BB, and a 1.167 OPS in 11 games, which shows everything you liked about him last off-season is still in here. Hold strong - 2025 Projection: 58/18/65/.223/.296/.411/3 Prime Projection: 82/26/88/.247/.332/.465/7

334) Adael Amador - COL, 2B, 22.0 - I warned that Amador's elite hit tool would take a step back in the upper minors in my Predicting the 2025 Top 50 Prospects Rankings last off-season, writing," Amador's strikeout rate won't be as elite in the upper minors as it was in the lower minors, and like many Rockies hitters who go from their hitter's park haven at High-A to their more neutral Double-A park, the offensive production won't be as eye popping. His value won't tank but it won't explode either." ... that is essentially exactly what happened with a .230 BA and 19.3/13.6 K%/BB% in 100 games. And his value actually tanked more than I thought it would, but I'm not sure it deserves to tank that hard. The .261 BABIP shows he was definitely on the unlucky side, and he still had 14 homers, 35 steals, and a 111 wRC+, so it was far from a disaster season. Colorado rushed him to the majors for 10 games in June because they are one of the weirdest franchises out there, but I would ignore those numbers. The 2B job is wide open for him, and while the power likely ends up below average, the hit, plate approach, and speed can certainly make a fantasy impact. - 2025 Projection: 28/5/26/.246/.305/.371/10 Prime Projection: 84/17/62/.273/.341/.426/27

335) Brice Matthews - HOU, SS, 23.0 - Matthews was one of my top targets from his FYPD class because I saw an explosive athlete when watching him, and he proved that explosiveness will translate to the upper minors in 2024, slashing .265/.384/.481 with 15 homers, 32 steals, and a 31.4/13.4 K%/BB% in 79 games at mostly Double-A (but also rookie, High-A and Triple-A). I wish I could raise the victory flag and truly explode him up the rankings, but unfortunately the hit tool was a bit worse than hoped. He was hanging in there with a 26.8% K% at High-A, but it immediately jumped to 33.7% at Double-A, and then 39.6% to close out in the season in 12 games at Triple-A. He's now in the Puerto Rican Winter League and has a 35.3% K% in 20 games. Sure he's 5.4 years younger than average in that league, but he's already a 22 year old college bat who could conceivably break into the majors this year, so he's not that young for that level really. The dude obviously has a very real strikeout problem, and I can't just gloss over it. I comped him to Tommy Pham last year, and I predicted like Pham, it could take into his mid 20's for the hit tool to click, but when it does click, the returns will be very big. I'm sticking with that timeline. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/74/.233/.318/.431/26

336) Nolan Gorman - STL, 2B, 24.11 - The Cards announced that they want to get a full season of at bats for Gorman and Jordan Walker without the threat of demotion, but for Gorman, it doesn't look crystal clear how that is going to happen at the moment, although a Nolan Arenado trade would help clear that path. His hit tool went in the wrong direction in 2024, tanking with a 37.6% K% and .209 BA. The power was just fine with a 16.7% Barrel% and 19 homers in 107 games, but his hit tool was bad to begin with, and it just went from bad to worse. It doesn't give a ton of hope that he is magically going to make major, major strides there, and he's a bad defensive player, so he's going to need to improve it considerably if he wants to remain an everyday player. There is also platoon risk even if he can make those improvements. I want to call Gorman a buy low, because he's a 25 year old with a career .335 xwOBA and a proven carrying tool in his power, but the hit tool/defense/platoon risk combo is stopping me short from going too hard. - 2025 Projection: 64/26/72/.224/.302/.436/6

337) Owen Caissie - CHC, OF, 22.9 - Caissie is a super easy evaluation as a low BA, high OBP slugger, but he really doesn't hit as many homers as you would think with 19 homers in 127 games at Triple-A. His 33.4% FB% is on the low side for a slugger, which is what is holding down the homer totals. It's helping his BA, hitting .278, but with a 28.4% K% (which is a career best), he's not going to hit for a high BA in the majors regardless. There could be a scenario where the strikeout rate is hovering around 30% in the majors with a launch that really isn't all that high, which could result in some pretty mediocre numbers. I mainly bring this up because it's the most interesting thing about projecting his future value, but when you pan out for the big picture, he's a powerful and athletic 6'3'', 190 pounds with current plus power and possibly more coming down the line. He'll also chip in with steals, nabbing 11 bags. And add two stars in OBP leagues with a 12.9% BB%. I don't want to lose the forest through the trees by slicing and dicing the numbers too much, so I'm still projecting his as a low BA, high OBP slugger no matter how you slice it. There is a short term logjam for playing time, but long term I don't see many roadblocks. 2025 Projection: 19/6/25/.227/.303/.420/2 Prime Projection: 78/28/91/.246/.335/.480/7

338) Orelvis Martinez - TOR, 2B/3B, 23.5 - Martinez got popped with an 80 game PED suspension in June, and I'm honestly struggling to figure out how much to dock him for that. I didn't dock Tatis much for his PED suspension, and that turned out to be a good move. But Tatis was an established MLB superstar already. I then followed suit by not docking Noelvi Marte much, and that looks like a mistake with him possibly being the worst player in MLB last year, dropping off everywhere you look. Martinez clearly fits better into the Noelvi mold than Tatis mold, but everyone is their own person, and I don't want Marte's season to influence Martinez' ranking too much for me. Martinez returned in September and he put up a .882 OPS with 1 homer in 11 games at Triple-A, so that is a good sign that the suspension won't impact him that much. And before the suspension, he was beasting the league with 17 homers, a 13.1% Barrel%, 46.1% Hard Hit%, 23.8/8.5 K%/BB%, and a 120 wRC+ in 74 games. His power is no joke with 30+ potential on the MLB level. Toronto traded for Gimenez, but 3B is still open for the taking, and it wouldn't be crazy to see Martinez win that role pretty quickly into 2025 (pending any off-season moves). I'm going to stay a bit restrained here because of the suspension, but I don't want to be overly scared off. This is a big time power bat who is knocking on the door of the bigs with opportunity. I'm cautiously buying. - 2025 Projection: 36/12/43/.229/.298/.422/1 Prime Projection:  76/28/87/.247/.323/.477/3

339) Jacob Misiorowski - MIL, RHP, 23.0 - The hope was that Misiorowski's control/command would take a step forward this season, but it just didn't happen. He put up a 14.4% BB% in 97.1 IP at mostly Double-A. They moved him into the bullpen when he got the call to Triple-A, and the control didn't improve in short outings either with a 14.3% BB%. He finished the season with a 3.33 ERA and 30.5/14.4 K%/BB%. His evaluation basically remains exactly the same from last off-season. He's 6'7'', 190 pounds with premium stuff and super high upside. The upper 90's fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon and his breaking balls are plus and miss bats. You hate to say it, but it is really a reliever profile right now. It's far too early into his development process to write him off as a starter though, and I highly doubt Milwaukee is ready to do that either. Even if he breaks into the majors in the bullpen, he will definitely be a candidate to get transitioned back into the rotation at some point too. I'll keep betting on the huge stuff and let the chips fall where they may. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.91/1.34/67 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.58/1.27/183 in 150 IP

340) Josue Briceno - DET, C/1B, 20.6 - As the world's foremost expert on Josue's, I presented you with the first zero hype Josue to pick up as quick as possible in 2022 (Josue De Paula), and then knowing a good Josue when I see one, I did the same for the 2nd zero hype Josue in 2023 (Josue Briceno). Both of their hypes have grown considerably since then, and if not for a knee sprain knocking out 2 and a half months of Briceno's season, his hype could have been even more. But he's making up for lost time right now in the AFL, winning the MVP award with 10 homers and a 1.376 OPS in 25 games. Even with the knee injury and not really having a good regular season, he still ended up with a 123 wRC+, 89.8 MPH EV and 14.8/12.5 K%/BB% in 40 games at Single-A. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with a potentially special hit/power combo. He's likely a 1B long term, which is perfect for his type of bat. Even with his profile rising, it's still not enough. He remains a major target for me this off-season. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.275/.350/.488/3

341) Jarlin Susana - WASH, RHP, 21.1 - I called Susana the Hunter Greene starter pack that was still sitting in the plastic, waiting to be put together coming into this season, and well, he started to assemble those pieces in 2024. After a rough start, he caught fire, putting up a 2.79 ERA with a 39.4/9.3 K%/BB% in his final 77.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. The Greene comp is actually extremely on point for the similarly sized, 6'6'', 235 pound Susana with an upper 90's fastball that doesn't get enough movement, a double plus slider, below average control, and a developing splitter. The improvements that Greene made this season (turning the splitter into a legit third weapon and improving his fastball movement) are the same improvements Susana has to make as he continues to climb the ladder. He also needs to continue to improve his control/command, as he can start to look a big relievery at times. There is still plenty of risk here, but there is legit top of the rotation upside, and he could have a soft landing spot as an elite closer. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.55/1.26/187 in 165 IP

342) Keibert Ruiz - WAS, C, 26.8 - Ruiz took a big step back in 2024 with his EV tanking to a career low 85.4 MPH, leading to a career worst 71 wRC+. These were supposed to be the years he had an uptick in power, not taking a major step back. The 11.1% K% was still elite, and his EV was much better in 2022-23, so he should bounce back somewhat in 2025 in that department. He's a lift and pull machine with a 35% GB% and 51.2% Pull%, but if he can't hit the ball considerably harder, that is a recipe for a super low BA, which bottomed out to .229 this year. He'll be better in 2025, and he's still young in catcher years offensively, so I'm far from giving up on him, but I just can't get excited about him right now. - 2025 Projection: 51/16/61/.250/.300/.391/3

343) Bo Naylor - CLE, C, 25.1 - Naylor followed up his strong rookie season with the classic sophomore slump. He put up a 74 wRC+ with a .201 BA, 13 homers, and 6 steals in 123 games. The underlying numbers were just as bad with a .260 xwOBA and 31.4/7.5 K%/BB% in 123 games. But the good news is that underlying numbers of the underlying numbers are actually pretty encouraging. A 8.1% Barrel% with a 28.3% whiff% and 27.2% Chase% is actually pretty good. That collection of skills tells me what he did in 2024 is not his true talent level, and that we should expect a much better year 3. He was also the 6th best defensive catcher in baseball according to Fangraphs, so Cleveland should give his bat every opportunity to hit it's stride. He's still a very enticing young catcher despite the terrible season. - 2025 Projection: 64/20/64/.228/.309/.418/8

344) Ethan Salas - SDP, C, 18.10 - Salas is an example of where pushing your prospects too fast goes wrong, although what Salas did as a 17/18 year old at High-A has to be graded on a major curve, and most importantly, it doesn't matter what his numbers were this year. The only thing that matters is if he's developing to be an impact major league player down the line, so it's even too early to say it was a mistake. He slashed .206/.288/.311 with 4 homers, 10 steals, and a 20.9/10.0 K%/BB% in 111 games. The strong K/BB rate is important, because it shows he wasn't completely overmatched or anything. He was also a bit better towards the end of the season with a .723 OPS in his final 28 games, which he's carried over into the AFL with a .751 OPS in 23 games. And he hit really well in 2023 at Single-A, so he does have a track record to look at to not be overly concerned about this year. He's an excellent defensive catcher who will have no problems sticking behind the dish, and that will also juice up his trade value as he ranks extremely high on real life lists. Catchers get downgraded in fantasy in general, and while I do still like his bat a lot, there is a question about exactly how high his offensive upside is. I would value him as a really good prospect, but not an elite one. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/85/.269/.342/.468/9

345) Brady House - WAS, 3B, 21.10 - House hasn't had the elite prospect explosion we hoped for when he was a hyped high school bat, and his .241/.297/.402 triple slash with a 26.4/5.7 K%/BB% in 129 games split between Double-A and Triple-A isn't all that impressive either, but when evaluating prospects, you have to have an eye towards who they can be, rather than who they are today, and House can definitely still be a middle of the order power bat at peak. His power did take a step forward this year with 19 homers, and he's still a relatively svelte 6'4'', so I think there is more power coming when he gets into his man muscles years. Keep in mind he was just 21 years old in the upper minors, while hyped, similarly aged college bats were struggling or not exactly dominating in the lower minors. He needs to improve his hit tool and plate approach, which is why he isn't ranked higher on this list, but he still looks on track to be that middle of the order power bat we thought he could be. The Nationals 3B job is also wide open for the taking in both the short term and the long term. - 2025 Projection: 28/9/36/.230/.291/.408/4 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.253/.326/.457/9

346) Trey Sweeney - DET, SS, 24.11 - Sweeney was one of my favorite proximity stashes during the 2024 season, even moving him into my Top 100 at some point, and his MLB debut just emboldened my love for him. He's 6'3'', 212 pounds with a 74.1 MPH swing which is in double plus territory. It resulted in a 91.1 MPH EV with a 12.8 degree launch. His 28.1 ft/sec sprint speed is above average to plus, stealing 16 bags in 96 games at Triple-A and 3 bags in 43 games in the majors (including the playoffs). He was also a plus defender at SS. This is a pretty special athlete here. His .642 OPS in 36 games isn't super impressive, he didn't exactly dominate Triple-A with a 88 wRC+, and there is hit tool risk with a 32.4% whiff%. But all of those are more than baked into his price, overly so in my opinion. My attention is on the things he does well, and that makes him a very enticing target relative to his perceived value. - 2025 Projection: 71/18/76/.237/.308/.416/11 Prime Projection: 83/22/78/.252/.328/.444/14

347) Deyvison De Los Santos - MIA, 1B/3B, 21.9 - De Los Santos is a one tool player, but that tool is so massive and so important, that it just might overcome that he does nothing else well on a baseball field. And that thing is of course double plus power. He's a power hitting bull at 6'1'' with 40 homers and a 90.6 MPH EV in 137 games in the upper minors. He swings and misses a lot (24.6% K%), he doesn't walk (5.8% BB%), he hits the ball on the ground way too much (50%+ groundball rates), he's bad on defense, and he doesn't steal bases. There is actually one other thing going for him, which is that he's been very young for the upper minors in 2023-24, and he'll still be just 21 years old for almost half of the 2025 season. There is time for him to improve his plate skills and launch. If he can, he has the upside to be one of the best power hitters in baseball, but even if he can't, there is a role for a guy who can hit 30+ homers even if that is all he does well. Miami should also have plenty of opportunity for him if he's raking. - 2025 Projection: 41/15/52/.228/.280/.435/0 Prime Projection: 73/31/88/.256/.314/.495/2 Update: He looked bad in spring and will start the year at Triple-A

348) Luke Keaschall - MIN, 2B/OF, 22.8 - Keaschall's season ended on August 8th with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery, but we all know by now that you don't need elbows to hit. Ohtani just went 54/59 while rehabbing from internal brace or whatever super secret surgery he underwent. Keaschall ain't Ohtani, but point being, I don't think the surgery should ding his value too much. And his value was starting to get pretty exciting with him proving the profile will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .281/.393/.439 with 8 homers, 9 steals, and a 19.1/12.0 K%/BB% in 58 games at Double-A. He doesn't have huge raw power, but he hits the ball fairly hard, and can definitely lift and pull it with a 35.3% GB% and 50.3% Pull%. He's got speed, he gets the bat on the ball, and he has a good approach. It's possible the good but not great tools will play down a bit on the major league level, and he's also not a particularly good defensive player, so he's going to have to hit. But a lift, speed, contact, approach profile is a lot of boxes to check, and the profile is fantasy friendly. - 2025 Projection: 18/4/12/.247/.304/.399/5 Prime Projection: 82/19/72/.266/.334/.436/19

349) Michael Wacha - KCR, RHP, 33.9 - This is the third year in a row where Wacha massively outperformed his underlying numbers with a 3.35 ERA vs. 4.05 xERA. Plus control guys seem to often beat the ERA estimators, so I wouldn't say they are lucky, it just feels like a much more precarious skill than guys who miss bats. He does have two bat missing secondaries with a 34.1% whiff% on the changeup (his most used pitch), and a 37.3% whiff% on the slider, so he has legit outpitches. It's not just dotting the 3 fastballs. I kinda buy into him, but at 33 years old, and with limited K's, you can only like him so much. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.77/1.24/142 in 160 IP

350) Nathan Eovaldi - TEX, RHP, 35.1 - Eovaldi has had some injury issues throughout his career, but he's tremendously consistent when he's on the mound. He put up a 3.80 ERA with a 23.9/6.0 K%/BB% in 170.2 IP in 2024, and he's put up ERA's between 3.63 and 3.87 over the past 5 seasons. Considering how volatile ERA can be, that is an impressively tight band to sit in over an extended period of time. He throws hard (95.4 MPH fastball), he has 2 bat missing secondaries (splitter and curve), he has a diverse pitch mix (5 pitches), and he has plus control. Age is really the biggest detractor here, because at 35 years old, we are definitely entering "cliff" territory at any point, and the injury history doesn't help either. - 2025 Projection: 11/3.83/1.18/156 in 160 IP

351) Walker Buehler - BOS, RHP, 30.8 - I know Buehler isn't on the Dodgers anymore, but I find him the most interesting guy to discuss right now from their 2024 team. He was coming off his 2nd Tommy John surgery, and it sure did look like he was doubly rusted when he returned. It took him until the playoffs for him to even start feeling at least halfway like himself. And despite the terrible season, it seems like people aren't too scared off by him. He's going 248th overall in NFBC right now, which is pretty high, and I gotta say, I'm out on him at that price for sure. His name value still clearly carries a lot of weight, and while I do respect the track record, and the very good possibility he will be much better in his 2nd year removed from the surgery, I still don't think he'll be good enough to warrant his still decently high price tag. He put up a 5.38 ERA with a 18.6/8.1 K%/BB% in 75.1 IP in the regular season. He got a late start to the season due to the elbow, even though he got the surgery all the way back in August of 2022, which was a bad sign, and then he missed 2 months during the season with a hip injury. The stuff was diminished even further when he returned from that injury. He was better in the playoffs with a 3.60 ERA in 15 IP, but the stuff was still diminished, and it came with a 20.6/7.9 K%/BB%, so it's not like he was back in prime form or anything. He throws a 7 pitch mix, and not a single one of them put up a whiff% over 30%, which isn't good. His whiffs were already coming down before the injury, and now they are in the toilet at 19.4% overall. His stuff really isn't all that standout anymore, and is arguably below average. He's an aging, banged up pitcher with decent stuff and continually declining whiff rates. I'm out at his current price. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.09/1.30/137 in 150 IP Update: Good spring has me a bit more confident on him, but still treading carefully

352) Nick Martinez - CIN, RHP, 34.8 - It looks like Nick Martinez will finally take his rightful spot as a full time rotation member, and it's long overdue. He had his 3rd straight great season since returning to the states, putting up a 3.10 ERA with a 20.4/3.2 K%/BB% in 142.1 IP. He used a different formula this year to do get it done with an elite 3.2% BB%, and while he had to give up some whiff gains to do it, he still has a put away changeup with a 41.6% whiff%. He induces weak contact (86.4 MPH EV) and he has a 6 pitch mix. Cincy isn't the best place to pitch, to say the least, so the upside isn't that high, but he should be a rock solid mid-rotation starter. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.76/1.24/130 in 150 IP

353) Matthew Boyd - CHC, LHP, 34.2 - Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in mid August, and age be damned, he looked as good as new. He put up a 2.72 ERA with a 27.7/7.8 K%/BB% in 39.2 IP. The 29.7% whiff% was straight elite, and 4 of his 5 pitches were truly standout (4-seamer, change, slider, curve). The velocity was all the way back at 92 MPH, and so his control with walk rates right around his career average. There was literally nothing not to like about his return, and the underlying numbers fully back up the surface stats. The biggest concern of course is injury as he hasn't thrown more than 78.2 IP since 2019. Expecting him to rack up innings at that level of quality at 34 years old seems like the very, very, very high end outcome, but I'm a sucker for a great pitching small sample that people aren't completely buying into, so he's a buy for me as a win now team. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.77/1.23/145 in 140 IP

354) Jeffrey Springs - OAK, LHP, 32.6 - Springs returned from Tommy John surgery and the velocity was down (89.8 MPH fastball), the K/BB rates weren't quite back to true prime levels (26.1/7.7 K%/BB%), and then he closed the season back on the IL with an elbow injury after throwing only 33 IP. And now tack on him getting traded from one of the best organizations to one of the worst, and I'm definitely out on Springs. There is a ton of risk here, he's never thrown more than 135.1 IP in a season, he's already 32 years old, and the name value is probably too high to get too good of a price. - 2025 Projection: 7/3.85/1.25/148 in 135 IP

355) Edward Cabrera - MIA, RHP, 27.0 - I'm basically at the point where I want Miami to pull the trigger on moving Cabrera to the bullpen and letting him finally live out his destiny to be a near elite closer. Miami's closer job is wide open for him too. But I don't get to make that decision, and I can't deny that I definitely still have hope for him as a starter too. He throws gas with a 96.3 MPH fastball (although the pitch hasn't actually been that good), he has 2 good bat missing secondaries (changeup and curve), and he has a diverse pitch mix (he also throws a sinker and slider). The 11.8% BB% actually wasn't that horrible this year either, but still not good. He wasn't that good in general with a 4.95 ERA and 25.7% K% in 96.1 IP. He also continued to battle a shoulder problem that he also battled in 2023, keeping him out for 2 months earlier in the season. To me, it seems like it's time to make that switch, but with all of the injuries and trades, it looks like he's locked in as a starter. I'm rooting for bullpen, but I'll accept a starter job. He's not a target, but he's not an avoid either if his price slides too low. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.92/1.32/125/7 saves in 110 IP

356) Joe Musgrove - SDP, RHP, 32.4 - Musgrove underwent Tommy John surgery in October and will miss all of 2025. He battled arm injuries in 2023 and 2024, so in hindsight, this felt inevitable, although he was actually starting to pitch damn well in the 2nd half of 2024 before finally succumbing to the surgery. He's a borderline case as a Tommy John discount category as he's established with near ace upside, but he hasn't really shown that upside in a couple years and he'll be 33 years old when he returns. I can't say I'm particularly targeting him at a discount, but I'm not eliminating him from my rankings either. I'll take a shot in some leagues if he's super cheap. - 2025 Projection: OUT

357) Colby Thomas - OAK, OF, 24.2 - Colby Thomas comes to the plate with one thing in mind and one thing only ... well, maybe two things ... and those things are lifting it and pulling it. He has a relatively open batting stance that telegraphs his intentions, and he executes his plan with a 33% GB% and 54.5% Pull% at Triple-A which led to 17 homers in 73 games (31 homers in 132 games on the season). He's not necessarily a raw power beast at 5'10'', but he's pretty thick and he definitely has more than enough power to make his profile work. He's also a good athlete who stole 15 bases this season and 25 bags in 2023, which gives him that added upside bump to make him a very enticing proximity stash headed into 2025. The thing that can tank him is that the hit tool is very shaky with a 30.3/7.3 K%/BB% at Triple-A, and there is something about the batting stance which feels like it could get a bit exposed in the majors. The profile is actually very similar to Connor Norby, except Thomas has more raw power and runs more, while I trust Norby's hit tool more. Don't overextend yourself here, but he's definitely someone to put a star next to their name if you want to take an upside shot on someone who could very well break camp with the club. - 2025 Projection: 48/13/46/.229/.294/.420/10 Prime Projection: 75/23/78/.252/.318/.452/15

358) Denzel Clarke - OAK, OF, 24.11 - Back in 2023, I literally had Lawrence Butler and Denzel Clarke ranked back to back in my 2023 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings at #744 and #745. They both had extremely similar profiles. They are the same age, they are almost the same size, they are both excellent athletes with plus power/speed combos, they are both Oakland prospects, they are both outfielders, and they both had major swing and miss problems with strikeout rates north of 30% at High-A. But that is where their paths started to split, as Butler made extreme improvements to his strikeout rate, putting up a sub 20% K% in the upper minors in 2023 and 2024 (and obviously holding enough of those gains in the majors), while Clarke's strikeout rate remained in the 30%+ area ... that is until the 2nd half of this season. From June 12th on, Clarke slashed .317/.387/.524 with 9 homers, 30 steals and a 23.5/8.6 K%/BB% in 73 games at Double-A. Granted, he did it two years after Butler, so age to level isn't as impressive, and he also had to lower his launch to do it with a 50.5% GB%, but that is still a major improvement to see, because like Butler, he has the type of power/speed combo to make a major fantasy impact. Even with the lower launch, he has the power and speed to make that type of profile work. I've been heavily debating Colby Thomas vs. Clarke, and while I gave the nod to Thomas because I trust his hit tool and launch more, I think Clarke has the upside nod. He's a definite target this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 28/7/32/.220/.289/.397/9 Prime Projection: 76/20/74/.244/.318/.430/25

359) Cedric Mullins - BAL, OF, 30.6 - Mullins is terrible vs lefties (.506 OPS in 101 PA), and he's only an average CF at best, so he's basically in a pretty strict platoon role at this point. And with a speed first profile entering his 30's, this is a train you want to jump off of. He was limited to just 499 PA in 147 games in 2024, and it resulted in only 69 runs and 54 RBI. The fun power/speed combo is still there with 18 homers (21.5 degree launch), and 32 steals (28.2 ft/sec sprint), but the launch is so extreme, it kills his BA too (.234 BA). He really seems like he's entering the part time player part of his career, and while he can maybe stave that off for another season, it's not going to be for much longer. - 2025 Projection: 67/16/61/.240/.310/.408/28

360) Alejandro Kirk - TOR, C, 26.5 - Kirk couldn't bounce back from a down 2023 with even worse year in 2024, putting up a career worst 94 wRC+. He hit just 5 homers with 0 steals in 103 games, and the .253 BA didn't even come close to making up for the lackluster power/speed combo. He graded out as the 4th best defensive catcher in baseball, so there is little worry about him losing his job, he hit the ball very hard with a 89.4/94.1 MPH AVG/LD EV, and the contact rates are elite with a 13.2/9.1 K%/BB%. His true talent level is better than what he's shown over the last 2 seasons, but he's the opposite of a lift and pull guy, so the homer totals are always going to be lackluster unless he drastically changes his hitting profile. He's a safety over upside catcher option if you want to protect your BA. - 2025 Projection: 49/12/68/.267/.343/.405/0

361) Brendan Donovan - STL, 2B/OF, 28.3 - All the hubbub over Donovan's 2023 Spring Training power surge turned out to be real (I thought it was real at the time as well), but 14 homers in 153 games is still lackluster, especially when it comes with only 5 steals. The plate skills are elite with a 12.4/7.2 K%/BB%, and it's led to a career 119 wRC+, but a 123 overall finish on the Razzball Player Rater in 2024 shows it's not a fantasy friendly profile. He's pretty close to an empty BA play, which are not my types of players. I want to like Donovan more than I actually do. - 2025 Projection: 76/16/68/.280/.352/.419/6

362) Lars Nootbaar - STL, OF, 27.5 - Nootbaar stole only 7 bags in 10 attempts in 109 games, which just isn't enough for his type of profile, because he also doesn't hit for a high average (.244 BA in 2024 and .246 in his career), or hit enough homers (12 homers in 2024). He hits the ball very hard with a 91.8 MPH EV, but his launch has actually gone in the wrong direction, declining every year of his career with a 6 degree launch in 2024. His speed has also declined every single year of his career, bottoming out to a below average 27 ft/sec. Maybe you can blame injuries for that, but he's never played in more than 117 games, so not sure injuries would be a point in his favor. Plate approach of course is his best asset with a 19.5/12.8 K%/BB%, so add two stars in an OBP league, but in a 5x5 BA league, it seems his ceiling is just solid. - 2025 Projection: 74/15/71/.260/.352/.425/11

363) Joey Ortiz - MIL, 3B, 26.8 - It seems like Ortiz will slide over to SS to take over for Willy Adames (Turang could factor in too), but either way, his full time job seems very safe with a plus infield glove. His hard hit ability wasn't able to fully transfer to the bigs with a 87.8/91.4 MPH AVG/FB EV, resulting in only 11 homers in 142 games, but his strong plate approach did transfer with a 20.2/11.0 K%/BB%, leading to an above average 104 wRC+. He's fast with a 28.7 ft/sec sprint, but he's not a good base stealer with 11 steals in 17 attempts. It's a low upside, solid across the board profile if things go well, and if things don't go well, it's below average across the board. I'm betting on things going relatively well though. - 2025 Projection: 71/15/67/.256/.327/.406/13

364) Nolan Schanuel - LAA, 1B, 23.2 - I wasn't high on Schanuel this off-season because as you guys already know, hit tool/plate approach first guys without a big power/speed combo is just not my bag, and what Schanuel did in 2024 is why they aren't my bag. He hit 13 homers with 10 steals, 62 Runs, and 54 RBI in a full 607 PA. Even his .250 BA wasn't good, because often "hit tool" guys don't actually hit the ball hard enough to have a truly great hit tool. You need power for that too. His 86.1/89.2 MPH AVG/FB EV is super low, he's slow as dirt with a bottom 24% sprint speed, and his 65.2 MPH swing was 5th worst amongst qualified batters. He's also not really a lift and pull guy with a 46.1% GB% and 40.4% Pull%. Now having said all that, this was his first full year of pro ball and he put up an above average 104 wRC+. That is pretty impressive. He's 6'4'', 220 pounds, so there is no way that there isn't more power in here if he ever decides to actually swing harder, which may or may not impact his elite contact rates (14.4% whiff%). He can certainly be a useful fantasy bat at peak, and there is some semblance of power upside purely because of his size, but you can't own everyone, and Schanuel is just not the type I ever own. - 2025 Projection: 79/15/68/.270/.356/.402/9

365) Andrew Vaughn - CHW, 1B, 27.0 - I guess it's definitely time to give up hope on the breakout. Vaughn now has 2,258 career PA of being a very average hitter. But damn if there still aren't a few things here that I don't want to completely give up on. He raised his launch 4.4 degrees to a career high 16.6 degrees. He put up a career best 9.3% Barrel%, which is pretty damn good. He hits the ball hard with a 90.3 MPH EV. And he gets the bat on the ball with a 22% whiff%. That should result in more than 19 homers in 149 games, but then you see the below average 70.8 MPH swing, and you go "aha," now it makes sense. The new bat speed data has been providing that missing piece to so many players for me this off-season, and that explains Vaughn right there. He's coming into his age 27 year old season, and as I laid out, there are still some things to like, so I'm not going to tank his value, but I'm finding it hard to think a breakout is coming. - 2025 Projection: 68/22/79/.250/.310/.431/1

366) Joc Pederson - TEX, OF, 32.11 - Pederson has been the best platoon bat in baseball over the last 3 years, putting up xwOBA's in the top 5-10% of baseball in each year. It resulted in a career best 151 wRC+ in 449 PA in 2024. The lack of PA seriously cuts down his upside in fantasy though as he only had 62 Runs and 64 RBI. He's hard to roster in weekly lineup leagues, and while he's obviously valuable in daily lineup leagues, even in many of those leagues it's not that comfortable rostering a platoon bat. He's also basically 33 years old already. You feel the pull to rank a guy higher who just put up a .902 OPS with beastly underlying numbers, but the lack of PA and age prevent me from getting too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 66/25/71/.257/.345/.470/5

367) Nathaniel Lowe - WSH, 1B, 29.9 - No surprises here. Lowe had his usual wet napkin fantasy season. He hit only 16 homers with 2 steals in 140 games. He had a 121 wRC+ on the back of a 12.6% BB%, but even in OBP leagues, a combined 131 Runs and RBI is lackluster. He's just not a very impactful fantasy player. In 5x5 BA leagues, he's super lackluster, and in OBP and 6+ hitting category leagues he's mediocre at best. Very deep leagues are where he would hold his most value, but even there it's not like he's a league winner. He's a placeholder until you can find a better option, which is exactly what Texas thought of him. - 2025 Projection: 76/18/76/.265/.360/.425/2

368) Ryan McMahon - COL, 3B, 30.3 - McMahon's hard hit ability (92.1 MPH EV) has roped me in in the past, but those days are long over at this point, and it gave me the strength to not buy into his hot start to the season at all (.920 OPS in his first 32 games). By the end of the year, he was right back to his usual underwhelming self with 20 homers, a .242 BA, and a .722 OPS. He just doesn't lift and pull enough to take advantage of the hard hit (49% GB% with a 35.8% Pull%), and the hit tool isn't good enough either (28.7% K%). He's a good defensive 3B and it's not like the Rockies have any better options, so his job is safe, but he's just a serviceable 3B, not an impact one for fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 76/23/74/.245/.325/.425/5

369) Alec Burleson - STL, OF, 26.4 - The Cards are committed to letting the kids play in 2025, so I wouldn't say I'm overly concerned with Burleson's playing time, but he actually has a lot going against him. He's a terrible defensive player, he's terrible vs lefties (.514 OPS in 142 PA), he's slow as dirt with a 25.5 ft/sec sprint and he's a 27 year old with a career .307 OBP and 97 wRC+ in 275 games. Even in his breakout 2024, he still only had a 106 wRC+, which combined with the poor defense and baserunning resulted in a 0.6 WAR. It hurts me to say it, but he's really not a starter. Having said that, the 12.8% K% is elite and he hits the ball hard with a 89.7 MPH EV. With the Cards in rebuild/bridge year mode, he should at least have a strong side of a platoon role, and there is no guarantee he gets fully relegated to that role either. Long term though, he looks like a good but not great platoon bat, which isn't extremely valuable in fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 68/20/77/.270/.318/.424/6

370) JJ Bleday - OAK, OF, 27.5 - Bleday is a low ceiling player with little speed, a below average BA, and above average homer power at best. I also think there is risk too, because he's a below average outfielder, and Denzel Clark and Colby Thomas are charging hard to compete for those open OF jobs. Kurtz and Soderstrom could push Rooker into more OF duty too. I see the appeal with a 19.5/10.4 K%/BB%, an 88.5 MPH EV, and a 18.6 degree launch, but I just don't really see an impact player here. He's not a starter on a good team, and while Oakland isn't good yet, they are kinda getting there. He's actually getting valued pretty highly, so if you can sell high here, I would go for it. The upside just isn't high enough to make you regret it too much even in a worst case scenario. 2025 Projection: 74/19/69/.245/.328/.420/4

371) Lourdes Gurriel Jr. - ARI, OF, 31.6 - Gurriel is just about the poster child for high floor, low upside vet bat. He gets the bat on the ball with an 18.3% K%, he'll pop 20-ish dingers with a solid Barrel%, and he'll even steal a handful of bags. Nothing flashy. Nothing league winning. Just rock solid. The deeper the league, the more value a guy like this has. - 2025 Projection: 69/20/79/.267/.312/.435/5

372) Pavin Smith - ARI, 1B/OF, 29.2 - Even with Arizona trading for Naylor, Arizona still has openings at DH and in the OF, and with the year Smith just had in 2024, I'm betting on him winning a job. He was a straight beast in 60 MLB games with a 142 wRC+, 14.7% Barrel%, 13.1 degree launch, 90.2/96.2 MPH AVG/FB EV, and a 19.6/11.4 K%/BB%. It resulted in an elite .395 xwOBA. He always had an excellent plate approach, but we were waiting on the game power to tick up, and boy did it tick up this year. He looks like a great candidate for a late career breakout, and is a no doubt target. - 2025 Projection: 76/24/82/.268/.342/.457/2

373) Jhonkensy Noel - CLE, OF, 23.8 - If you've been loving diving into the new bat speed data like I have, the first thing that smacks you right in the face is how elite Noel's bat speed is. Only Giancarlo Stanton and Oneil Cruz top his 78.1 MPH bat, and it's not a particularly long swing either. It's not short, but it's not in the territory to be concerned. And at 6'3'', 250 pounds, with that fast of a swing, bad things happen when he makes contact, smashing 13 homers with a 14.5% Barrel% and 19.3 degree launch in 67 MLB games. The flip side of swinging that hard and fast, is that it comes with a lot of missing the ball too with a 34.2% whiff% and 31.8% K%. He also seems to mostly close his eyes and just swing at anything with a 45% Chase%. He's bad on defense, and while he was good vs righties in the minors, he didn't hit them well in the majors (.683 OPS). He's big and he swings hard and that is about it, but we know that is all you need to make a big fantasy impact if your bat is in the lineup everyday. That last part isn't guaranteed though with Cleveland being pretty deep in corner/DH power bats. Why play Noel against a righty when you can play Kyle Manzardo? Or Will Brennan? or Chase DeLauter? Or George Valera? I wouldn't be overly concerned about it because if he mashes he will give them no choice, but he wasn't playing everyday down the stretch, and you have to at least have playing time problems in the back of your mind. - 2025 Projection: 71/27/83/.238/.311/.482/2

374) Ryan Clifford - NYM, 1B/OF, 21.8 - After hitting only 1 homer in 31 games in New York's tough High-A ballpark (although he didn't hit any homers on the road either), Clifford got the call to Double-A as a still 20 year old and lived up to his big power profile. He jacked out 18 homers with a 133 wRC+ and 28.9/15.6 K%/BB% in 98 games. Even at High-A he put up a 124 wRC+, which is the sign of a good player who can still produce when the homers aren't coming (or it's a sign that High-A pitchers just didn't want to pitch to him with a 23.5% BB%). Clifford was one of my favorite targets in his first year player draft class because he looked like a sure bet to become an exciting power hitting prospect, and that is exactly what he's become. The strikeouts are too high to really put him into that elite tier, but I wouldn't rule out him improving there at a still young 21 years old. Even if he can't, the power will play on any level. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/31/90/.239/.324/.491/4

375) Cam Collier - CIN, 3B, 20.4 - Collier might be the most underrated power hitting prospect in the minors. He's a big physical guy at 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful and quick lefty swing that is made to do damage, so he most certainly looks the part. It's what got him drafted 18th overall. And now he has the production part too with a blow up season at High-A as a 19 year old. He smashed 20 homers with a 25.0/13.0 K%/BB% and 129 wRC+ in 119 games. He crushes the ball and the power is at least plus. Age to level production, EV, pedigree, approach, eye test, great eventual home ballpark ... Collier has a ton of things going for him, and he really gets barely any hype. There is definitely hit tool risk, but that often comes with the package for young power hitters. Don't underrate Collier. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/29/93/.252/.333/.486/5

376) Xavier Isaac - TBR, 1B, 21.4 - Isaac was always a power over hit prospect, but his hit tool risk shot into the stratosphere this year. He put up a 30.1% K% in 71 games at High-A, and then it got even worse at Double-A with a 40.6% in 31 games. It stayed that bad when he went to the AFL too with a 40.3% in 15 games. He clearly has a major, major problem. He wasn't nearly this bad in 2023 with a 21.3% K%, so while this didn't come completely out of nowhere, it's definitely much worse than expected. He crushes the ball with 18 homers in 102 games, he's a good athlete with 15 steals in 18 attempts, he gets on base with a 13.3% BB%, and he's very young, so he's still a very exciting prospect, but it prevents him from jumping into that elite or near elite tier coming into 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/28/86/.240/.324/.469/10

377) Zac Veen - COL, OF, 23.4 - Long gone are the days where Veen is a major prospect target for me. The book is far from written on him, but I think it's more than fair to say he is one of my biggest misses in terms of ranking him as a near elite prospect a couple years ago. The development simply hasn't happened like I thought it could, and him being a Rockies prospect, yea, maybe I should have seen that coming. But just because he hasn't blown up, doesn't mean he's still not a pretty enticing fantasy prospect. As I expected, he bounced back from an injury induced down year in 2023, slashing .259/.346/.459 with 11 homers, 21 steals in 25 attempts, and a 24.8/11.1 K%/BB% in 65 games at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. We saw a power uptick that we were waiting for, but it was more of a moderate power uptick than a true explosion. And once again, his year was marred by injuries with a back and thumb injury, which once again sapped some power when he returned. I don't know whether to think the constant injuries are hiding that upside that made me fall in love originally, or if he's simply injury prone and it's something that should be a demerit on his profile. Maybe a little of both. What makes him so exciting for fantasy is his speed and base running ability, which are at least plus, and he also has a good glove in the OF, which could get him on the field. The strikeout rates are elevated and the power looks like it might only end up average at best, so while I still see so much upside at a still projectable 6'3'', 190 pounds, I can't rank him any higher than this. 2025 Projection: 29/6/26/.229/.292/.371/11 Prime Projection: 78/18/68/.248/.319/.418/25

378) Rhett Lowder - CIN, RHP, 23.1 - Lowder was known as a high floor, low ceiling, fast moving college pitcher in his draft year, and that is exactly what he gave us in 2024. He put up a 3.64 ERA with a 25.3/5.4 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at mostly Double-A, and then he got the call to the bigs and held his own with a 1.17 ERA (4.25 xERA) with a 17.2/10.9 K%/BB% in 30.2 IP. I trust the K/BB and xERA more than the ERA, but even with the underlying numbers being lackluster, there were other positive takeaways from the debut. Namely his 93.5 MPH fastball put up a very good 27.8% whiff%. Plus control of a good fastball is a very strong foundation, and Lowder is more than just that with a legit 4 pitch mix. The slider and changeup were less impressive in the majors, and he wasn't putting up big strikeout numbers in the minors, so development of those secondaries will be huge to unlock more upside. As is, he projects as a solid mid rotation starter, but there is definitely upside for more. - 2025 Projection: 5/4.11/1.31/106 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.72/1.16/177 in 175 IP

379) Zebby Matthews - MIN, RHP, 24.10 - Zebby had a mixed bag MLB debut, and I think it leaned more bad than good. The good part is that the 24.3/6.2 K%/BB% and 4.05 xFIP looks really solid. K/BB is King for pitchers, so that alone tells me that I think Zebby will be fine. But I have some concerns, and those concerns are that his heavily used 94.9 MPH fastball wasn't nearly as good in the majors as it was the minors, and that his stuff got hit really damn hard in both the majors and Triple-A, leading to a 6.69 ERA in 37.2 MLB IP, and a 5.68 ERA in 19 AAA IP. His fastball put up a 94.3 MPH EV against in the majors and a 93 MPH EV against at Triple-A. His 2nd most used pitch, the slider, also got hit really hard at both stops with a 90.2 MPH EV against in the majors and a 94.7 MPH EV against at Triple-A. He had a 14% Barrel% against in the majors, which is wildly bad. His slider and changeup both missed bats, we know how good his control is with a ridiculous 7 walks in 97 IP in the minors, and this was just his first taste of the majors after starting the season at High-A. He definitely deserves some grace to have an adjustment period, especially because he was reaching a career high in IP, and the strong K/BB rate gives added confidence that he will figure it out. It's just that I feel his reasonable upside projection drops from maybe a #2 to a #3. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.26/1.31/121 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.77/1.24/180 in 170 IP

380) Moises Chace - PHI, RHP, 21.10 - Chace has one of those beautiful double plus fastballs that is just a wonder to watch. It visually looks like it's swimming through the air, picking up speed before it blows by some poor minor league hitter. Saying it's explosive would be an understatement. It's been racking up strikeouts in the lower minors since 2021, and then he got his first shot at the upper minors to close out 2024, and he shined with a 3.66 ERA and 45.5/9.1 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP over 4 outings. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus slider and solid changeup. The one thing that can tank him is his control as he put up a 12% BB% in 80.1 IP on the season, and it's been even worse than that in the past. It definitely might end up being the fatal flaw which puts him in the bullpen, and it prevents me from really going too crazy here, because I do love the stuff. Even with that risk, he's an excellent upside pitching prospect who should come at a very reasonable price. This isn't a comp, but think something like what DJ Herz did this year. I'm going after him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.81/1.27/168 in 150 IP

381) Victor Robles - SEA, OF, 27.10 - I definitely noticed Robles leveled up a bit in 2023, ranking him a pretty decently 543rd overall last off-season considering his career up until that point, and in 2024, Robles proved that leveling up was for real. He had the best season of his career by 75 country miles, slashing .307/.381/.433 with 4 homers, 34 steals, and a 18.0/7.1 K%/BB% in 91 games. If someone would have told me back in 2017 that Robles would have a 141 wRC+ in his age 27 year old season, I would have clearly assumed that he fulfilled his elite prospect destiny. But we all know that wasn't the path at all, and the problem is that you can't really trust that 141 wRC+ at all either. A .370 BABIP was doing a lot of the heavy lifting for that high BA (.257 xBA), and while bumping up his EV about 2 MPH is a big reason for the breakout, a 86.7 MPH EV is still well below average. He's going to play corner outfield (he's a below average CF), he doesn't get on base a ton, and his speed has actually been declining with a career worst 27.8 ft/sec sprint. He's basically a steals only player who should probably be a 4th outfielder. He has a starting job right now and he clearly has the ability to make a big impact in steals, so I see the appeal, but I'm only in here at a super, super cheap price. He's going 192nd overall in NFBC over the last month, which I find kinda crazy. - 2025 Projection: 74/9/48/.262/.333/.382/30

382) Brock Wilken - MIL, 3B, 22.10 - Wilken is a 6'4'', 225 pound masher who has the 3B job wide open for him right now with Willy Adames hitting free agency, likely moving Joey Ortiz to SS (or Turang to SS and Ortiz to 2B). There definitely seems to be a path to playing time, and there is little doubt that he will hit dingers and get on base when he gets that chance with 17 homers and a 13.4% BB% in 108 games at Double-A. The hit tool was worse than we hoped for with a .199 BA and 28.2% K%, but some of that was definitely bad BABIP luck. He was also hit in the face with a pitch on April 11th, sustaining multiple facial fractures, so I think we can cut him some extra slack for that, although he performed better the first 3 months after returning than he did in August and September, so maybe that is just an excuse. Either way, I'm betting on the monster power, pedigree (18th pick in the 2023 MLB Draft) and opportunity. - 2025 Projection: 27/11/36/.219/.296/.427/1 Prime Projection:  75/28/86/.238/.320/.476/2

383) Ralphy Velazquez - CLE, 1B, 19.10 - Velazquez was one of my top FYPD targets last off-season, ranking him 21st overall, and he more than delivered with a big season at Single-A. He cracked 10 homers with a 20.1/15.0 K%/BB% and 131 wRC+ in 82 games. He struggled when he got to High-A with a 54 wRC+ in 19 games, but considering he started the year as an 18 year old, that isn't a big deal. Cleveland moved him off catcher to 1B, which isn't surprising and is a good thing for fantasy. One of the reasons I loved him so much last off-season was because when a smart team takes a 1B prospect so high (23rd overall), you know they absolutely love the bat, and at 6'3'', 215 pounds with a smooth and powerful lefty swing, it's hard not to love his bat. He profiles as a classic middle of the order slugger. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/30/92/.258/.345/.500/6

384) Ben Rice - NYY, 1B, 26.6 - I'm a simple man. I see a .340 xwOBA vs. a .269 wOBA in 50 games and I'm going to buy that 9 out of 10 times. And it's not just xwOBA. The individual components back it up too. He put up a 15.6% Barrel% with a 90 MPH EV, 17.7 degree launch, 25.8% whiff%, and 20.6% Chase% in his rookie year. Sure he was already 25 years old, but it was still his first taste of the bigs, and those are super impressive marks despite the poor surface stats (.613 OPS). He also utterly decimated the upper minors with a 155 wRC+ in 49 games at Double-A and a 174 wRC+ in 30 games at Triple-A. His lefty bat is made for Yankee Stadium with a lift, pull, and crush the ball profile. He doesn't have defensive value and he hits righties better than lefties, but his bat is too good to write off even with the Goldy signing. It's only a one year deal, and Rice will eventually get the opportunity to show he can be the man in 2026 and beyond. I still like him as a target, but he's a let him come to you target. Don't overpay. - 2025 Projection: 33/10/36/.241/.328/.433/2 Prime Projection: 82/25/82/.259/.342/.457/6

385) Cole Young - SEA, 2B/SS, 21.8 - Young put up a 119 wRC+ in 124 games at Double-A as a 20/21 year old, which is impressive, but he did it on the back of an elite 15.8/12.1 K%/BB%, making him a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect. He hit only 9 homers, there isn't big raw power in here, and he's not a guy looking to hit dingers with a low launch, all fields approach, so he doesn't project for big power either. The biggest blow to his fantasy value is that he isn't a good base stealer, going 23 for 34, and he's not a true burner, so his upside on the bases is questionable too. I don't think we should underrate the fact that he was 20 years old at Double-A, and that includes the power/speed numbers, so I don't want to to be overly harsh, but he remains a better real life than fantasy prospect, which has been the book on him since being drafted. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/17/62/.278/.349/.426/18

386) Michael Arroyo - SEA, 2B, 20.5 - Arroyo always had precocious plate skills, writing in his 2024 Top 1,000 blurb, "He looks like a seasoned vet at the dish, and is the type who jumps out immediately when you watch him hit. He’s completely locked in and makes hitting a baseball look easy." But I questioned his power upside at only 5'8'', and in 2024, he answered those power questions in a resounding fashion. He clubbed 23 homers in 120 games split between Single-A and High-A, and he did it while remaining a good all around hitter, slashing .285/.400/.509 with a 23.0/12.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, and he can hit the ball hard. His swing looks damn quick to me too. He's not a burner, but he can run a little bit too with 18 steals. There certainly seems to be some little man discount going on here, because Arroyo has a lot to be excited about. He's easily a Top 100 dynasty prospect, and if he were 6'2'', we might be talking about him in an entirely different way. The biggest issue is that Seattle will be his home ballpark, and without huge raw power, it's going to limit his upside. That is why I would hesitate to stick your neck out too much, but I still like him a lot. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/77/.268/.347/.445/14

387) Ricky Tiedemann - TOR, LHP, 22.8 - Tiedemann underwent Tommy John surgery in late July which will likely wipeout his entire 2025 season. It's definitely a blow to his value, but honestly, with a young flamethrower like this, it should be completely expected. If you jump ship on every flamethrowing pitching prospect you own after undergoing major elbow surgery, you might as well not even draft them (which is a completely viable strategy, although I don't mind taking a shot on one or two). I already used Tiedemann as a trade piece last season in my 12 teamer, as even when I do own them, I don't hesitate to use them in win now deals. That deal netted me 2 years of Will Smith, who helped me secure 3rd place and my money back. Such a fitting lukewarm finish for the lukewarm fantasy player Smith has become. But back to Tiedemann, assuming full health, he has the potential for a plus to double plus fastball/slider combo, to go along with a pretty damn good changeup too. The control/command is below average, so along with the injury, there is certainly a lot of risk in the profile at the moment. Hopefully he can get back on the mound at the end of the season, or even in the AFL, to show the huge stuff is back and to get the hype going into the off-season. He's definitely still a Top 100 Prospect for me, and even that might be selling him too low. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection:  13/3.53/1.21/185 in 165 IP

388) Tommy Troy - ARI, 2B/SS, 23.3 - Troy saved his season at the end of the year, because it looked like his dynasty value was in a nose dive before slashing .276/.375/.447 with 4 homers, 9 steals, and a 22.2/11.8 K/BB% in his last 32 games at High-A. He then went to the AFL and kept on hitting with a .864 OPS in 22 games. A hamstring injury knocked out 2 months of his season early in the year, and it seemed like he just couldn't find a rhythm when he returned, so there is something to point to for the slow start. The skills and general explosiveness of his game that got him drafted 12th overall are all still there. His hype definitely dropped this year, but I would be careful about selling too low here. He's still a Top 100 prospect for me. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/18/71/.251/.320/.427/23

389) Arjun Nimmala - TOR, SS, 19.6 - Nimmala got off to a slow start in full season ball, which is completely understandable considering he was only 18 years old, but once he found his footing, he showed why he was one of the most hyped high school bats in his class. He slashed .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers, 5 steals, and a 29.7/6.4 K%/BB% in his last 53 games. He has one of the sweetest righty swings in the game that is tailored made to launch the ball to the moon with a 46.6% FB%. It's powerful too with a 89.1 MPH EV, and at a projectable 6'1'', there is only more power coming. He's also a good athlete who should contribute in steals even if he isn't a huge base stealer. The biggest issue is clearly the hit tool, but you have to give him some leeway for his age, and the upside is high enough to take on that extra risk. I have Nimmala grouped with Brandon Winokur and Eric Bitonti as tooled up power hitting beasts with hit tool risk in the back half of the Top 100 Prospects Rankings. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/28/89/.242/.321/.473/14

390) Dylan Beavers - BAL, OF, 23.7 - Beavers doesn't have a clear path to a full time job right now, but there are bench jobs available for Beavers to force his way into the lineup at some point during 2025, and we all know injuries/trades happen. He can play all 3 OF spots and is a pretty good defensive player. There is a reason Baltimore didn't use him as trade bait (yet). I think they like him a lot. There is going to be opportunity eventually, and he has the type of fantasy friendly skillset to go after. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 206 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that hits the ball hard and hits the ball in the air (15 homers with a 49.1% FB% in 119 games at Double-A). He's also fast with 31 steals. The hit tool isn't great with a .241 BA and 22.6/13.2 K%/BB%, but the high walk rates mitigate some of that, and he has the type of power/speed combo to survive a low BA. Beavers looks like a very enticing, not hyped to death fantasy target right now. - 2025 Projection: 17/5/21/.228/.297/.391/5 Prime Projection: 81/20/75/.247/.326/.430/24

391) Brandon Winokur - MIN, SS/OF, 20.5 - Winokur is one of my favorite prospect targets right now relative to perceived value. 6'6'', 210 pound athletes like this don't grow on trees, and I think he deserves to rise to true unicorn status. His big time power is obvious, and it resulted in 14 homers with a 89.6 MPH EV in 94 games at Single-A. The area of his game that gets considerably underrated, is how good of an athlete he is. He put up plus run times in high school, and then he went out and stole 23 bags in 29 attempts this year. He played both SS and CF this year. This is not some lumbering corner bat. This is a unicorn with real defensive value. The problem, of course, is the hit tool. He put up a 28.0/8.3 K%/BB% and he swings and misses a lot. There is no denying there is very real risk here, but that is why he isn't like a Top 50 prospect. As is, I believe he is a top 100 fantasy prospect, and he won't be valued anywhere close to that in off-season prospect drafts. He's a major target. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/26/83/.246/.317/.471/15

392) Eric Bitonti - MIL, 3B, 19.5 - In my End of Season Mailbag Podcast (Patreon), I ran down a list of several of my favorite underrated and/or reasonably priced prospect targets to go after, and Bitonti easily cracked that list. He has future elite power hitting prospect written all over him at 6'4'', 218 pounds with a powerful, athletic and sweet lefty swing that is made to hit bombs. He smoked 8 homers with a 157 wRC+ in 51 games at the age appropriate stateside rookie ball, and then he got called up to Single-A and went nuclear with 8 homers in just 28 games. With his raw power and an over 50% FB%, he can't not hit homers. He also gets on base a ton with a 16.5% BB%, which offsets some of the swing and miss issues (27.9% K%). And he's a good athlete with 12 steals in 15 attempts over 79 games, so he should contribute at least a handful in that category. Definitely go after him everywhere. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/33/97/.242/.331/.497/8

393) Aidan Smith - TBR, OF, 20.8 - The Rays targeted Smith in the Randy Arozarena trade (along with Brody Hopkins), which is good news for Smith, because he goes from a ballpark that is terrible for his profile, to one that is perfect for him (assuming Tampa goes back to the Trop in future years). Isaac Paredes proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the righty lift and pull profile can thrive in Tampa, and that is Smith's game with a 35.7% GB% and 54.4% Pull% (11 homers in 97 games at Single-A). He combines that with projectable power at 6'2'', 190 pounds, plus speed with 41 steals in 47 attempts, and a strong plate approach with a 23.2/14.4 K%/BB%. The hit tool is still on the risky side, but if he gains meaningful raw power as he enters his 20's, he has true explosion potential. He's really exciting. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/76/.250/.338/.443/25

394) Cooper Pratt - MIL, SS, 20.8 - The only thing Pratt didn't do at Single-A was hit for power, hitting only 3 homers with a 25% FB% in 73 games, but when he got the call to High-A, he immediately proved that he wasn't going to have any problems getting to his potentially plus power with 5 homers and a 38.7% FB% in just 23 games. At a projectable 6'4'', there is no doubt the raw juice is in there, and he also proved to be an excellent athlete (27 steals) with a strong plate approach (20.0/10.3 K%/BB%). The plate approach was much better at Single-A than High-A, and some of that was certainly because he was trying to get to more of his power. So he's not a finished product, but the ingredients are in here to be an impact across the board fantasy player. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/23/80/.262/.328/.453/18

395) Kyle Teel - CHW, C, 23.2 - Teel was known as a high floor, lower ceiling, quick moving college catcher in last year's FYPD, and that is exactly what he did in 2024. He slashed .288/.386/.433 with 13 homers, 12 steals, and a 23.0/13.5 K%/BB% in 112 games split between Double-A (145 wRC+) and Triple-A (97 wRC+). His 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A isn't super impressive, but he knows how to lift and pull it, so he should get the most out of his raw power. He's also a good athlete who likes to run relative to other catchers, so that can help his fantasy value even if the homer totals aren't huge. He had a crystal clear path to Boston's starting catcher job of the future (and the present), but with his trade to Chicago, he now has to battle it out with Edgar Quero. You have to think Teel is the favorite for most of the at bats, but that might be a bad assumption, and at the end of the day, that will get decided on the field. The trade probably doesn't change Teel's dynasty value too much in the grand scheme of things, but it's a ballpark hit, organization hit, and a bit of a path to playing time hit. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/34/.244/.311/.383/4 Prime Projection: 74/17/68/.268/.342/.430/9

396) Welbyn Francisca - CLE, SS, 18.10 - After getting lots of hype coming off his strong pro debut in the DSL, Francisca's hype seems to have quieted down to barely a whisper despite a very strong follow up season in 2024. He slashed .328/.418/.523 with 6 homers, 11 steals and a 12.4/12.4 K%/BB% in 45 games at stateside rookie ball, and then he went to full season ball as an 18 year old and didn't slow down, slashing .325/.402/.402 with 1 homer, 8 steals, and a 20.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 29 games. He's not a big guy at 5'8'', so power isn't expected to be a huge part of his game, but he can definitely pack a punch in that small frame. And keep in mind he will still be just 18 years old at the start of 2025. He's on pace to have one of the most enticing top of the order profiles in the minors, and I wouldn't completely sleep on his power either. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/16/61/.280/.346/.427/28

397) Robert Calaz - COL, OF, 19.5 - The 6'2'', 202 pound Calaz is a straight power hitting beast. He cracked 7 homers in 43 games in the DSL in 2023, he smoked 10 homers in 49 games in stateside rookie in 2024, and then he chipped in 2 homers in 13 games at Single-A to close out the season. He crushes the ball with plus to double plus raw power, and his batted ball profile is conducive to both power and average. He slashed .327/.386/.571 at Single-A as an 18 year old, and has a career .336/.436/.603 triple-slash in 105 career games. He's done nothing but obliterate every level of pro ball that's been put in front of him. He doesn't exactly have my favorite batting stance, but the swing is quick and powerful, and I'm not going to get too caught up in that. The biggest risk is the contact rates, as the strikeout rate has been high at every level (career 23.4% K%, which is quite high for rookie ball levels), culminating with a 28.1% K% at Single-A. We have to trust Colorado to develop him, which isn't great, and then we have to trust Colorado to actually play him and give him leash, which also isn't great. Combined with the hit tool risk, it prevents me from going higher than this, but he has one of the top 19 year old power bats in the minors. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/28/88/.247/.324/.471/7

398) Joendry Vargas - LAD, SS, 19.5 - Vargas was one of my favorite targets in his international class, and then was once again one of my favorite DSL breakout targets, so if anyone wants to crown him already, it would be me, but I can't quite crown him yet. He had a strong year in stateside rookie ball with a 129 wRC+, but 4 homers in 38 games shows the game power isn't quite there yet, the 22.8% K% is on the high side, and he wasn't that successful on the bases, going 11 for 16. So that means he still needs to improve his hit tool, power, and speed. Completely reasonable for an 18 year old rookie baller to need to improve basically everywhere, and I still love the power upside at a projectable 6'4'' with hard hit ability, but it's not quite that straight rocket ship you really want. He's a Top 100 prospect for me, but I can't put him in that truly coveted tier quite yet. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 81/25/85/.257/.336/.465/8

399) Eduardo Quintero – LAD, OF, 19.7 – Quintero was one of, if not the top DSL breakout in 2023, and he mostly backed it up in stateside rookie ball in 2024, slashing .330/.459/.449 with 3 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.3/17.6 K%/BB% in 56 games. It was good for a 142 wRC+. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 77 wRC+ in 27 games, but it came with a 19.6/16.1 K%/BB%, so it’s not like he was completely overmatched or anything. You have to give these kids time to adjust to a new level. He’s an excellent athlete at 6’0”, 175 pounds with plus speed, hard hit ability, a good feel to hit, and a plus plate approach. The launch is geared for both power and average, and he has a good glove in the OF. This guy basically does everything well on a baseball field, and while there is still plenty of development left to go (being more aggressive at the dish, getting stronger, unlocking more game power, proving it at higher levels), you have to trust the Dodgers to get the most out of him. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 86/19/74/.273/.341/.430/26

400) Bryce Rainer - DET, SS, 19.9 - Selected 11th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Rainer is your classic "looks the part" prospect at 6'3'', 195 pounds with a smooth lefty swing, plus power potential, plus athleticism, and a good glove at SS. Corey Seager and Kyle Tucker would be the absolute ceiling comps, while Colson Montgomery would be a more recent comp. Like Montgomery, Rainer is older for his class at 19 years old already, and his hit tool isn't a slam dunk either quite yet. Come to think of it, Riley Greene might actually be the perfect comp here, and Detroit has done a great job developing Greene. Detroit got their SS version of Greene (although Greene was a slightly more touted prospect in his draft year, so he would be close to a ceiling comp as well). - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.263/.336/.465/12

401) Braylon Payne - MIL, OF, 18.8 - When a smart franchise sticks their neck out and selects a high school bat higher than expected, you should take notice. I took notice when it happened with Xavier Isaac and Tampa, and then Ralphy Velazquez with Cleveland. I ranked both very high and named them targets. And now I'm going to do the same with Payne after the Brewers selected him 17th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft. The book on the 6'2'', 186 pound Payne coming into the draft was that he had big time talent and upside, but was still on the raw side. Which is why it was so exciting to see his electric pro debut where he slashed .438/.526/.625 with 0 homers, 4 steals, and a 15.8/15.8 K%/BB% in 4 games at Single-A. It's only 4 games, and the swing isn't geared towards power right now, but there is definitely raw power in there with a 110 MPH shot already to his name, and he has game breaking speed. He's also young for the class and will be 18 years old for most of 2025. Payne is the type of target you stick your neck out for in off-season prospect drafts, and after the consensus Top group is off the board, Payne is my next target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/18/63/.267/.334/.436/38

402) Theo Gillen - TBR, SS, 19.7 - Selected 18th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Gillen has near elite dynasty upside at 6'3'', 200 pounds with electric bat speed, potentially plus power, plus speed, and a good feel to hit. He still needs to learn how to fully tap into his raw power, and he underwent shoulder surgery from a torn labrum in 2022, so he's not a finished product, and he's not without risk. His pro debut underscored that with a  41.2% K%, .154 BA, and 86 wRC+ in 8 games at Single-A, but the 23.5% BB% mitigates that K rate a bit, it was only 8 games, and in the past, high schoolers debuted in rookie ball. Now they are thrown right into the fire in full season ball. I would give a lot of leeway for all of these high school bats, but I gotta be honest, the 41.2% K% is sticking in my craw right now. You can try to project the hit tool of these high school hitters all you want, but you really don't know if they will be able to hit pro pitching until they get there. I'm not panicking at all over the super small sample, and I still like him a ton, but I do think that extremely high K rate could be a harbinger of things to come. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/20/76/.252/.331/.441/20

403) Gavin Lux - CIN, 2B, 27.4 - The good news is that Lux got back to being a solid real life hitter in 2024 with a 100 wRC+ in 139 games after returning from a torn ACL, MCL, and hamstring that knocked him out for all of 2023. He was even better in the 2nd half the further removed he got from the injury, slashing .306/.390/.513 with 8 homers, 2 steals, and a 24.7/11.7 K%/BB% in his final 65 games. The bad news is that his fantasy profile is still severely lacking. His speed dropped off considerably with a 27.7 ft/sec sprint, and he was barely running even before the injury, so we can't count on much there. The power is also lacking with only 10 homers, a 9.1 degree launch, and a below average 6% Barrel%. Granted, those numbers were all considerably better in that 2nd half run, so I do think he can do better than 10, but we aren't talking about a power hitter here. The hit tool is only average-ish, and that includes the elevated K rate in that 2nd half run. And finally, he was terrible vs lefties, so he might be maxed in a platoon role. I can definitely see him putting up some pretty good "sum of his parts" fantasy seasons in the next few years, but the upside isn't very high. He's a low end option. - 2025 Projection: 73/14/61/.266/.339/.408/8

404) Jordan Romano - PHI, Closer, 31.11 - Romano got a few week late start to the season due to an elbow injury, was really bad for two months with a 6.58 ERA and 21/6.5 K%/BB% in 13.2 IP, and then he hit the IL with an elbow injury that ended his season. The word is that he will be fully healthy for 2025, but the weird thing is that he wasn't really showing signs of being hurt before going down with the injury. The velocity was completely normal at 96.4 MPH and the control was actually better. There are other ways an injury could impact your effectiveness, like the spin rate being down on the fastball, which it was, but I still find it adds an oddity to evaluating Romano. I guess you have to blame the injury for the terrible the season, and if he's fully healthy, the assumption is that he gets back to being a nearly elite reliever with a 3.00 ERA and upper 20's K rates. But for one, there is no guarantee he's actually fully healthy (and stays that way), and I still don't love the extreme performance drop when he was on the mound. He only landed a 1 year, $8.5 million deal, which tells me MLB teams are hesitant to bet on him returning to form. Philly has other good options to close and they love to mix and match. I wouldn't mind grabbing Romano if he drops, but I'm worried his name value will push him higher than I'm willing to go, and since he's only on a one year deal, who knows where he ends up in 2026 and beyond. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.65/1.25/66/24 saves in 60 IP

405) David Bednar - PIT, Closer, 30.6 - Despite David shitting the Bed ... nar, it seems like Pitt is set on giving him another crack at it in 2025. He straight up imploded in 2024 with a 5.78 ERA and 22.1/10.7 K%/BB% in 57.2 IP, but his stuff was actually up a tick, so maybe there was just some classic small sample, reliever volatility going on there. Relievers are known to have some wonky years because they simply don't pitch enough innings for things to "normalize." He was bad all year though, so it certainly didn't feel like an aberration. He'll have to prove himself in spring, and throughout the season, as I'm sure the leash is going to be short, but as of now, he seems like the man, and because his stuff was still excellent, I'm apt to take a flier on him as a team who usually waits on saves. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.77/1.24/68/28 saves in 62 IP

406) Andrew Abbott - CIN, LHP, 25.10 - Abbott backed up his strong rookie year in 2023 with another strong season in 2024, putting up a 3.72 ERA with a 19.5/8.9 K%/BB% in 138 IP, but there is really nothing in the profile that makes you want to buy in too hard. He doesn't have big stuff (92.8 MPH fastball), the secondaries don't miss bats with a below average 22.6% whiff% overall, he pitches in Cincy, and the control is below average. He's still early into his career and I'm sure he's working on improving all aspects of his game, but he's yet to flash the type of fantasy upside we want to see for him to really standout as a target. A shoulder strain also ended his season in late August, and while he was close to returning, that isn't great. He's just a guy right now. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.83/1.29/133 in 150 IP

407) Erick Fedde - STL, RHP, 32.1 - Fedde came back to the states after putting up an MVP season in Korea, and he proved the gains he made overseas were legit. He put up a 3.30 ERA with a 21.2/7.2 K%/BB% in 177.1 IP. His career ERA in the majors is 4.82 in 631.2 IP. He quite clearly leveled up like 3 levels. I was all for taking a flier on him last off-season because I lean into the mystery, but now that he put up that pristine ERA, I'm out on him for 2025. The 3.91 xERA was not nearly as good as the ERA, the 21.6% whiff% is well below average, and none of his pitches were that impressive. The cutter, sinker and sweeper were all positive value pitches, so I'm not saying he's a mirage, I'm just saying the upside isn't very high, and the time to buy was last off-season. MLB hitters now have an off-season to adjust back to the changes he made. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.92/1.25/145 in 170 IP

408) Brooks Lee - MIN, SS/3B/2B, 24.2 - I've always been a bit low on Lee for fantasy, because a good but not great hit tool first profile, with moderate power and little speed is just not something I go after, even with him getting ranked very high on real life lists. I also wasn't buying into the 8 homers he hit in 25 games at Triple-A this year because of the below average exit velocity and low launch, and sure enough, his MLB debut didn't look great. He slashed .221/.265/.320 with 3 homers, 3 steals, and a 14.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 50 games. His 25.6 ft/sec sprint speed is in the bottom 13% of the league. That is brutal, and it might be part of the reason why the guy scored a shockingly low 9 runs. The EV numbers were poor too with a 85.8 MPH EV and 4.1% Barrel%. And he chases a lot with a 35.8% Chase%, so he doesn't really fit in at the top of the order. He gets the bat on the ball and there is some pop in there, so I never thought he would be a bust or anything, I just thought the upside was low as a solid but not standout hitter, and I still believe that today. He's still not a target for me. - 2025 Projection: 64/14/73/.259/.313/.415/6 Prime Projection: 73/18/81/.277/.331/.436/8

409) Aaron Civale - MIL, RHP, 29.10 - I had hope for a Tampa magic strikeout breakout, but it wasn't to be. Civale remained a solid #4 type with a 4.36 ERA and 21.6/7.5 K%/BB% in 161 IP. That line is basically exactly who he's been in his entire career, although a bit on the low end of it. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.03/1.25/139 in 150 IP

410) Zack Littell - TBR, RHP, 29.6 - I named Littell a late round target last off-season, and while he wasn't a league winner, he more than held up his late round value with a 3.63 ERA and 21.5/4.7 K%/BB% in 156.1 IP. He throws 2 positive value fastballs in his 92.4 MPH 4-seamer and 91.6 MPH sinker, to go along with a slider that notched a +9 Run Value and a splitter that notched a 34.4% whiff%. The entire profile plays up due to elite control. There is competition in the Rays rotation, so it's not necessarily a lock that he will break camp with a spot, but I would be a little surprised if he didn't. He's a #3/4 fantasy starter. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.81/1.23/136 in 150 IP

411) Jameson Taillon - CHC, RHP, 33.4 - Taillon put up a 3.27 ERA in 165.1 IP, but ain't nobody being fooled by that. All of the ERA estimators sit around 4.00. He doesn't miss enough bats with a 18.4% K% to buy into it, but he has double plus control with a 4.9% BB%, which makes him a solid #3/4 type starter. - 2025 Projection: 10/4.03/1.21/133 in 160 IP

412) David Peterson - NYM, LHP, 29.7 - Peterson has been an enticing breakout candidate for a few years now, and now that he's finally broken out, I don't want anything to do with him. Life can be funny like that. The 2.90 ERA in 121 IP looks great, but I just can't buy into that at all with a 4.58 xERA and 19.8/9.0 K%/BB%. It was more of the same in the playoffs with a 2.92 ERA and 14.0/14.0 K%/BB% in 12.1 IP. K/BB is still King when it comes to pitchers, and those K/BB numbers just aren't something I can buy into. Now having said all that, there are definitely some things to like beyond the ERA. His 25.5% whiff% was above average, and he's missed a ton of bats in his career, so the low strikeout rate was definitely on the unlucky side. That should rise in 2025. His 93.1 MPH 4-seamer put up a near elite 28.7% whiff%, the 91.9 MPH sinker keeps the ball on the ground with a 0 degree launch, the slider misses bats with a 33.9% whiff% and the change and curve are solid pitches too. His 9% BB% was a career high, and he had a 5.9% BB% in his final 50 IP of the regular season. As I finish off this blurb, I think I might actually be talking myself into Peterson more and more. You know what, I take back what I said earlier about not wanting anything to do with him. If his price rises too high due to the ERA, I won't get him anywhere, but if he slips through the cracks, I don't mind taking some cheap stabs at him. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.92/1.30/140 in 145 IP

413) Sean Burke - CHW, RHP, 25.3 - Here is what I wrote about Burke right after his first start in the majojrs: "I’m far from ready to call Burke a target, but I will say that there are some interesting things brewing here that deserve our attention. He had his 2nd strong MLB outing in a row, going 5 IP with 5 hits, 2 ER, and a 5/2 K/BB vs. Oakland. The fastball sat 95.4 MPH and put up a 29% whiff%, while the slider and curve were solid as well with a 33% and 30% whiff%. It led to a 31% whiff% overall. His first outing against Cleveland was more of the same, and he now has a 2.25 ERA with a 30.4% whiff% in 8 IP. He has size (6’6”, 230 pounds), velocity (mid 90’s heat that misses bats) and bat missing secondaries (slider, curve change). He didn’t perform well at Triple-A with a 4.62 ERA in 64.1 IP, but all 4 of his pitches missed a ton of bats leading to a 31% K%. Control is the biggest problem here with well below average walk rates his entire career, but super tall pitchers can sometimes take longer to make control gains, and we all know that pitching development isn’t linear. So far in the majors he has a 8.3% BB%. Again, I’m not calling him a target, but I am saying there is some very interesting stuff going on here. There are definitely ingredients for a big breakout in the future, and as a free pick up in the vast majority of leagues, I don’t hate it all. Consider this your first little warning on Burke." ... and after that outing, Burke dominated in 2 more starts with 1 ER and a 14/4 K/BB in 11 IP. If he was able to do it in a larger sample, he might have been valued more closely with Spencer Arrighetti (both have similar-ish profiles), and I'm apt to use the small sample to my advantage. The skills are there are to be a high K mid-rotation starter, and he did prove it on the MLB level. He's an excellent later round target. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.96/1.31/149 in 140 IP

414) Tylor Megill - NYM, RHP, 29.8 - It's unclear exactly how the Mets plan on handling their rotation, but they have enough shaky guys where Megill should get his shot at some point, and usual, I find him intriguing. I've found him intriguing in the past, and it's never worked out, so I find it hard to really buy in too hard, but there are things to like. The fastball sat 95.7 MPH and put up an elite 29.2% whiff%. He throws an 8 pitch mix, and plenty of them are useful. The splitter put up a .148 xwOBA with a 42.9% whiff%. The curve, sinker and slider all put up an above average xwOBA and miss some bats. It all resulted in a 4.04 ERA with a 27.0/9.5 K%/BB% in 78 IP. If he had a rotation spot, I would definitely like him, but even without one, I can taking a shot on him in medium to deeper leagues. In shallow leagues, it's probably best to pounce when he actually cracks the rotation. - 2025 Projection: 8/3.83/1.29/137 in 130 IP Update: Injuries have opened up a spot for Megill to be in the rotation to start the year

415) Dustin May - LAD, RHP, 27.7 - May underwent flexor tendon surgery and a revision to his 2021 Tommy John surgery in July 2023 which wiped out his entire 2024 (surgery for a torn esophagus ended any bid to return in the 2nd half). His ability to stay healthy and at the top of his game has to be in major question right now. He didn’t look all that great before going down with the injury with a 18.2%/8.6% K%/BB% in 48 IP, although the stuff was still big with a 97.3 MPH fastball, and he was still getting the job done with a 2.63 ERA. He'll have to battle for a rotation spot, and it's a major question how he's going to look post surgery, so he's in pure flier territory for me. I'm just not into trying to guess what happens with the Dodgers rotation for their fringy guys. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.10/1.27/119 in 130 IP Update: It seems he won the 5th starter job out of camp, but I'm still treading carefully

416) Jack Leiter - TEX, RHP, 24.11 - We know that pitching development is especially non linear, which makes me want to stay strong on the 2021 2nd overall pick in the draft with plus bloodlines, but damn is Leiter making it hard. He made his MLB debut and got absolutely shellacked, putting up a 8.83 ERA with a 17.9/9.8 K%/BB% in 35.2 IP. He also didn't have the minor league career you would have expected from a talent like this, although he was much better in 2024 than 2023 with a 3.51 ERA and 33.3/10.6 K%/BB% in 77 IP at Triple-A. The below average control is killing him, but there is more than enough here for me to stick to my guns about staying strong. His 96.4 MPH fastball is a bat missing weapon that put up a 32.1% whiff% at AAA and a 28.9% whiff% in the majors. His slider was a whiff machine at AAA with a 43.2% whiff%, but it dropped off in the majors with a 21.8% whiff%. But on the flip side, his lesser used curve and changeup were actually pretty good in the majors. The curve put up a .212 xwOBA with a 38.7% whiff% on 11.4% usage, and the change put up a .237 xwOBA with a 35.7% whiff% on 5.8% usage. The pieces are still here to turn into an impact fantasy starter, and it seemingly should be able to work even with below average control, but so far, it just hasn't come together. We've seen this story a million times from top level talents like Leiter, so while he could easily end up being a bust, I'm not writing him off to that fate yet. He's a hold for me. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.34/127 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.74/1.26/183 in 170 IP Update: Added the kick change and has looked good in spring. I was already holding strong as possible on his value, and now it looks like he could win that 5th starter job

417) Kyle Harrison - SFG, LHP, 23.8 - I've been on the low side on Harrison for a few years now as he was getting truly elite pitching prospect hype, and his MLB debut showed why I wasn't fully buying in. He put up a 4.56 ERA with a 22.2/7.9 K%/BB% in 124.1 IP. The 92.5 MPH 4-seamer was solid with a .327 xwOBA and 23% whiff%, but the secondaries were straight trash. The slurve and change don't miss nearly enough bats, and the .356 xwOBA on both pitches was bad too. He has average control at best, so I'm not exactly sure what we are buying into here at this point. I guess youth and ballpark? He also ended the season on the IL with shoulder inflammation, so you can tack on injury risk too. We know pitching development isn't linear and we see late breakouts all the time, so I'm not saying Harrison is hopeless, I'm just saying he didn't show any skills in his debut that really makes me want to buy in. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.16/1.31/120 in 120 IP Update: Latest news has him not making the rotation

418) Bobby Miller - LAD, RHP, 26.0 - What a fucking disaster that was, huh. Miller came into 2024 as one of the most hyped young starters in the game, and he left it injured, disgraced, and without a job coming into 2025. The life of a young pitcher ain't easy (other than the $3,665,520 million in career earnings he has by the time he's 26 years old, although in LA, what does that buy you? A studio apartment?). Miller got shellacked in both the majors (8.52 ERA with a 20.2/11.6 K%/BB% in 56 IP) and Triple-A (6.00 ERA with a 17.6/13.1 K%/BB% in 33 IP). The stuff was down about 2 ticks across the board. The cause of the disaster is pretty easy to identify though. In his first start of the season, his velocity was the same as 2023, and he dominated with 11 strikeouts in 6 IP. His velocity then started to decline in the next 2 terrible outings, leading to him getting pulled in his 3rd outing of the season with shoulder inflammation. He was never the same after that 1st start, and his velocity never quite got back to 2023 levels. Even with diminished stuff, he still had humongous stuff with a 97.6 MPH fastball (99 MPH in 2023), but it wasn't only about the stuff, his control/command was way off too. The hope is that with a full off-season to get healthy, he looks much more like the guy from 2023 than 2024, and while he certainly has plenty plenty of competition for a rotation spot, you have to think that if he looks healthy in spring, he's the favorite to win one of the open jobs. Overall, I would say I'm lukewarm on him. Even in his great rookie year, he still only had a 23.6% K%, so when you tack on the injury risk now too, there are questions about both the pure upside and the floor. On the flip side, it's easy to bet on the monster stuff, history of production, and clear reason for the down year. I'm in between. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.93/1.31/76 in 80 IP Update: He still looked bad in spring and then got hit in the face with a comebacker. He's going to have to battle to get a rotation spot again, and will likely need injuries for it to happen

419) Caden Dana - LAA, RHP, 21.4 - The Angels fast tracked the talented Dana through their farm system, because of course they did, and once again, it mostly paid off for them. With the right players, they are proving the strategy can definitely work. Dana spent the entire season at Double-A as a 20 year old and excelled with a 2.52 ERA and 27.4/7.3 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP. He then got a taste of the majors and struggled with a 9.58 ERA and 15.4/13.5 K%/BB% in 10.1 IP, but that is basically meaningless. He racked up an impressive amount of innings for a 20 year old, and that was at the end of a very long season. He most certainly looks the part at a rock solid 6'4'', 210 pounds. The fastball sat 93.7 MPH and it gets good movement with bat missing ability. There could also be another tick or 2 coming down the line. The slider is nasty and even in his rough MLB debut it performed well with a 37.5% whiff%. The lesser used changeup, curve and cutter all performed really well too with a 37.5%, 50%, and 66.7% whiff%, respectively. He has about average command of the entire arsenal. He showed off mid rotation upside in 2024, and that was as a 20 year old in the upper minors and the majors. If he can take a step forward this off-season with his arsenal and command, there could be yet another level in here. - 2025 Projection: 4/4.27/1.34/87 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.73/1.20/194 in 180 IP

420) Jacob Wilson - OAK, SS, 23.0 - Wilson stole just 2 bases in 3 attempts in 53 minor league games, and then he didn't attempt a single steal in 28 games in his MLB debut. That is just brutal for his type of profile, and with a below average sprint speed, it doesn't seem like there is much hope for him to really be a major contributor in steals. And without that, there is just no upside in this profile at all with legitimately bottom of the scale power. He had a 84 MPH EV with a 2% Barrel% at Triple-A, and a 85.4 MPH EV with 0 barrels in the majors. He's a relatively thin and projectable 6'3'', so I definitely don't think it's impossible for him to gain power in his mid to late 20's, but that is an extremely low point to start from. Of course what you are buying is the truly elite contact rates with a minuscule 4.3% K% at Triple-A and a 9.7% K% in the majors, but even with that, he's going to need to hit the ball harder to truly take full advantage of that. This just isn't the type of profile I go after in fantasy, but in deep leagues where safety gets a bump, I could see going higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 73/5/42/.273/.328/.381/7 Prime Projection: 88/10/50/.291/.356/.405/10

421) Joey Bart - PIT, C, 28.3 - I feel like the theme of this year's catcher's rankings are the delayed offensive catcher breakout. And Bart fits that category perfectly after finally breaking out at 27 years old after being drafted 2nd overall in 2018. Both the power and hit tool took big steps forward with the EV jumping 1.9 MPH to 88.1 MPH and the whiff% dropping from 38% in 2022 to 26.2% in 2024. It resulted in a 121 wRC+, 13 homers, and a .265 BA in 80 games. He's now in the pole position to be Pittsburgh's starting catcher, but with Endy Rodriguez returning, and Henry Davis still in the picture too, this seems like it's going to be a never ending competition. If Bart played better defensively, I would be more confident he would lock it down, but he was below average defensively. He's a low end option right now. - 2025 Projection: 45/15/53/.242/.311/.418/1

422) Agustin Ramirez - MIA, C, 23.7 - Ramirez was the crown jewel of the Jazz Chisholm trade, so there is no way that Miami makes this deal if they don't have every intention of giving him a real shot, and with the catcher job wide open, it seems very possible that he breaks camp as the starting catcher (and also mixing in at some 1B and DH). He profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher with 25 homers and a .267 BA in 25 games in the upper minors. The 18.6/11.1 K%/BB% shows the plate skills are also pretty good, making him relatively low risk. The risk comes from the fact that he isn't a particularly good defensive catcher, so it's possible the bat will have to hit well enough to profile at 1B/DH as well. He also has former first round Joe Mack and his 2024 breakout right behind him, so there is definitely going to be some competition for that job in the near future. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/36/.238/.309/.418/2 Prime Projection: 58/19/69/.251/.328/.439/5

423) Braxton Ashcraft - PIT, RHP, 25.6 - I love Ashcraft when healthy, but his elbow health is a major question mark headed into the off-season with bright red warning signs flashing. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2022, and when he returned in 2023, his stuff looked electric in 52.2 IP. He again looked electric in the first half of 2024 with a 2.84 ERA and 25.8/4.0 K%/BB% in 73 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. But the elbow problems returned after his July 6th start, hitting the IL until August 30th. His stuff was way down in that one outing and then he hit the IL again with "a recurrent right forearm injury." As much as I love the mid to upper 90's fastball, the plus to double plus slider, plus control, size (6'5''), and pitch mix (he also throws a good changeup and curve), I can't ignore the very major injury risk. It could end up landing him in the bullpen eventually, or very early into 2025 if he has problems ramping up. If I were to ignore the injury risk, I can see ranking him much higher than this, so this placement factors in a healthy dose of risk. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.10/1.28/45 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/3.72/1.17/130 in 130 IP Update: He looks fully healthy this spring

424) Grant Taylor - CHW, RHP, 22.10 - Taylor looked so exciting coming off Tommy John surgery in his pro debut with a 1.13 ERA and 43.1%/4.7% K%/BB% in 16 IP at Single-A over 4 outings, but a lat strain cut his regular season short. He’s 6’3”, 230 with a mid 90’s fastball and a plus breaker as his best pitches. He has high spin rates on all of his pitches. He was the perfect candidate to absolutely blow up with a strong AFL showing, and while he hasn't done that with a 9.45 ERA and 12/6 K/BB in 6.2 IP over 3 outings, he has established that his nasty stuff is legit. The fastball sits mid to upper 90's, the slider is potentially plus, and the changeup is promising. He barely has any track record at all with a career high of 31 IP in 2022 in the SEC (52 IP if you include the 2022 Cape), so it's a mystery if he can stay healthy or if he can maintain this level of stuff over an entire season, but pitchers take this path all the time, and the stuff is undeniable. He definitely has some hype, so his price could vary depending on the league, but I would be more than happy to take a shot on Taylor if you are looking for a high upside arm. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.31/148 in 140 IP Update: He's looked fire this spring and has been untouchable

425) Drake Baldwin - ATL, C, 24.1 - Baldwin has a path to playing time problem with Sean Murphy under contract through 2028 at least, and I don't see why Atlanta would be motivated to trade either one of them (although it's certainly possible). Both of their bats are good enough to get some DH at bats, so I think both could theoretically survive even without a trade, but it cuts majorly into the projected playing time for them over the next several years. It's a shame for fantasy, because Baldwin is proving to have one of the most exciting prospect catcher bats in the game. He destroyed Triple-A with 12 homers, a 92.8 MPH EV, a 16.2/15.6 K%/BB% and 135 wRC+ in 72 games. He has the power, contact and plate approach to be a Top 5 fantasy catcher at peak, but along with Sean Murphy, there are a few things keeping me from going too crazy. His 96 wRC+ in 52 games at Double-A was not as good as his Triple-A run. His 7.7 degree launch isn't great and his groundball rates have been pretty high in the upper minors. His hit tool is also projected to be closer to average at best, rather than a truly impact tool. You don't need to be all that great to be one of the top hitting catchers in baseball, but tack on Sean Murphy to all of that, and he lands more as a Top 100 prospect for me rather than one I'm really targeting. 2025 Projection: 28/9/32/.238/.307/.399/1  Prime Projection: 64/20/78/.260/.335/.438/1 Update: The Murphy injury allows Baldwin to possibly get his foot in the door, but it's still a problem long term

426) Alejandro Rosario - TEX, RHP, 23.3 - The only box Rosario didn't check in 2024 was upper minors production, and while I do think that is a big step, even for pitchers, you can only dominate the competition that is put in front of you, and Rosario utterly dominated the lower minors. He put up a 2.24 ERA with a 36.9/3.7 K%/BB% in 88.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. He's 6'1'', 182 pounds with an athletic righty delivery that he uses to fire 3 potentially plus or better pitches. The fastball sit's in the mid to upper 90's and it's a bat missing weapon, He combines that with two plus secondaries in his slider and splitter, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out. The control was elite this season. He wasn't nearly this good in college (7.11 ERA with a 11.6% BB% in 74.2 IP his junior year), which is why he fell to 144th overall in the 2023 Draft, but Texas made some changes to his delivery and arsenal, giving reason to buy into the monster breakout. I would still like to see it in the upper minors first, and see him do it for a 2nd straight season in general, before truly valuing as an elite prospect, but if he dominates in his first start or two at Double-A in 2025, he will be a truly elite pitching prospect in the blink of an eye. White and Sykora have the more traditional path of size, youth, and pedigree, which is why my bet is on one of them to be the top dog in 2026, but maybe I'm sleeping on Rosario swooping in. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 13/3.52/1.18/189 in 170 IP Update: Underwent Tommy John which will knock him out for all of 2025

427) Trey Yesavage - TOR, RHP, 21.8 - Selected 20th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'4'', 225 pound Yesavage has been beating up on inferior competition in the American Athletic Conference for 2 years now, putting up a 2.03 ERA with a 40.4%/8.9% K%/BB% in 93.1 IP in 2024. But he's not just the product of his competition with 3 potentially plus pitches in his mid 90's fastball, hard slider, and nasty splitter. He has weapons to get guys out from both sides of the plate and his control is solid. He likely slid to 20th in the draft because of a collapsed lung that he suffered in May, which I guess does add some unknown long term risk, but all signs seem to indicate that he is okay now. There is definitely potential for him to become an impact mid rotation fantasy starter. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.76/1.22/180 in 170

428) Ke’Bryan Hayes - PIT, 3B, 28.2 - Hayes was dealing with a back injury all season that ended his year in mid August (and has dealt with injuries his entire MLB career), and it led to a horrific season with a 59 wRC+ in 96 games. The launch dropped all the way back down to 4.8 degrees, snuffing out any residual hope for a true power breakout. The EV and speed were down majorly too. You can give him a pass for this year for the injury, but this is not the first year that he blamed injuries for poor performance. It's becoming part of his profile, which adds risk, and he doesn't have high upside, so I'm not exactly sure what we are buying here anymore if he isn't safe and he doesn't have upside. - 2025 Projection: 71/13/60/.256/.311/.400/13

429) Jeimer Candelario - CIN, 3B/1B, 31.4 - Candelario got a monster ballpark upgrade in Cincinnati, and he did in fact hit a career high homers (on a per game basis) with 20 homers in 112 games. He's never been a huge EV guy, so he definitely needed the ballpark boost to continue to be a 20+ guy. The bad news is that the BA and OBP tanked to .225 and .279. A career worst 29.1% whiff% and 34.6% Chase% backs that up. The bottom line is that he is just an average hitter no matter how you slice it. He has a career 100 wRC+ in 858 career games. The India trades seems to lock him into a full time job, and as usual, he has the chance to be a solid but not really an impact fantasy bat. - 2025 Projection: 70/22/79/.237/.308/.431/6

430) Jorge Polanco - SEA, 2B, 31.9 - Polanco got traded to Seattle's death on hitters ballpark, and he died a thousand deaths in one season with a terrible year. He slashed .213/.296/.355 with a 29.2/9.8 K%/BB% in 118 games.  We just saw Teoscar die a similar death and then have a big year in a better park in 2024. But Polanco resigned with Seattle, so the hope of a Teoscar-lite bounce back is dead. He still put up a well above average 8.9% Barrel%, and he was on pace for over 20 homers if he played a full season. A hamstring injury knocked him out for over a month, and he can't blame the ballpark on that as he's been plagued by injuries the past few seasons. I definitely think he will bounce back and have a better year in 2025, but the injuries are starting to pile up, he's not getting any younger at 31/32 in 2025, and he's back in Seattle, so he's only a low end win now option. - 2025 Projection: 64/22/71/.245/.321/.430/5

431) Ryan Bliss - SEA, 2B/SS, 25.4 - Maybe I got a little too overexcited about Bliss when I named him a major target mid-season, but I still love his potential fantasy impact relative to his super, super subdued hype, and even after the Jorge Polanco signing, there is still a path to playing time if he forces the issue. The main selling point is the stolen base upside with him stealing 50 bags in 93 bags at Triple-A. But what makes him so exciting, is that he is not just a light hitting speedster. He can actually hit the ball pretty damn hard, and he showed that in his MLB debut with a 88.5/98.2 MPH AVG/FB EV. The EV was strong at Triple-A too with an 88.8 MPH EV. He's not a huge lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull enough to rip some dingers (12 in 93 games at AAA), and especially in Seattle's ballpark, we don't want him to lift and pull. Hitting the ball hard all over the field works perfectly for his profile. He's also a good 2B. The biggest issue is that the hit tool is not quite optimal for this type of profile. He put up a 22.4% K% at AAA and a 31% K% in the majors. The plate approach is good with a 14.1% BB% at AAA and an excellent 21% Chase% in the majors, which mitigates the hit tool somewhat, but not all the way. That is the thing holding me back from going too crazy, but Bliss could be free to very cheap in most leagues, and why not take a shot. - 2025 Projection: 61/13/52/.237/.304/.380/23 Prime Projection: 77/17/66/.254/.325/.416/31

432) Jhostynxon Garcia - BOS, OF, 22.3 - Garcia is one of my top prospect targets relative to perceived value, and he was one of several prospect targets I named in my End of Season Mailbag Podcast (Patreon). He has legit thunder in his bat with a quick and powerful righty swing that resulted in 23 homers in 107 games. He hits the ball really hard and he lifts it with all fields power. He's also a good athlete who can play CF, and he'll run a bit too with 17 steals. He started the year at Single-A and flew all the way through to Double-A by mid August. He wasn't quite as good at Double-A as he was in the lower minors, but he still put up an above average 103 wRC+, and the most important thing is that his K rate didn't skyrocket with a 19% K%. The hit tool and plate approach are certainly the biggest risk here with a 21.6/7.2 K%/BB% overall, but the K rate actually got better at each higher level, and he walked a ton in 2021-23, so he has that skill in there. His combination of power, athleticism and good OF defense is very enticing, and the hit tool was actually pretty decent this year. Boston is crowded, so he doesn't have a path to playing time, but trades happen and injuries/ineffectiveness happens too, so he'll get his shot eventually, and when he does, we could be looking at a guy who puts up big EV's with a high launch, above average sprint, positive defense value, and good enough K rates. He can be a legit impact fantasy bat going for a price way under that right now. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/25/84/.247/.321/.458/12

433) Brayden Taylor - TBR, 3B/SS, 22.10 - Taylor destroyed High-A with 14 homers, 26 steals, a 24.8/15.9 K%/BB% and a 154 wRC+ in 84 games, but he's an advanced college bat, and he doesn't have big raw power or big raw speed, so seeing what he could do in the upper minors was important, and it was a mixed bag at best. The K% exploded to 36.8% (.194 BA), but he still knocked out 6 homers with 3 steals and a 113 wRC+ in 30 games. He's a lift and pull machine, so even without big raw power, he can hit dingers, and he's not a burner, but he's been a really good base stealer at every stop of his career. It's the hit tool that is the real problem, and while I'm sure he will be better his second time around in the upper minors, it's still not a good sign for what his hit tool will look like in the majors. A high K rate with mediocre EV's and lots of flyballs is a recipe for a very low BA. It's still a fantasy friendly skillset with pedigree (19th overall pick) and strong production at every stop of his career, so while I can't call him a truly coveted prospect, I still like him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/20/76/.242/.325/.435/15

434) Max Muncy - OAK, SS, 22.7 - Muncy cracks the 3B list too because there are rumors he could be competing for that open job. Considering he was the 25th overall pick in the 2021 Draft, he's been flying super low under the radar despite strong minor league results throughout his career, especially when you consider age to level. Oakland has been relatively aggressive with him, and he's responded to the challenge every single time, culminating with him putting up a 117 wRC+ in 50 games at Triple-A in his age 21 year old season this year. He doesn't have a standout area in his game, which is likely why the hype has been so quiet, but he's just a good all around player with 8 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.6/8.9 K%/BB%. He has about average power right now which should only tick up in the next few years, he's a very good athlete who should contribute in steals, and he's known as a good defensive SS, so his glove should help him get on the field The strikeout rates have been high throughout his career and there is definitely hit tool risk, so that combined with the fact he doesn't really have standout power or speed makes me hesitant to go higher than this. He still feels underrated to me though. - 2024 Projection: 36/9/43/.226/.289/.392/7 Prime Projection: 72/20/77/.248/.321/.435/12

435) Alfredo Duno - CIN, C, 19.3 - Duno skipped right over stateside rookie ball and opened the season at Single-A, which tells you how much Cincinnati loved this kid. And really everyone loved this kid as a hyped up international signing who destroyed the DSL and most certainly looks the part at 6'2'', 210 pounds. Not only did he hold his own at the level, but he thrived with a 127 wRC+, 10.5% Barrel%, 89 MPH EV, and a 19 degree launch. He only hit 3 homers in 32 games, but that clearly isn't indicative of his true talent level. And he only played in 32 games because his season ended in late May with a broken rib. There is hit tool risk with a 28.8% K%, but considering how young he was the level, I'm not overly concerned with that. He's an elite power hitting catcher prospect waiting to happen, and he has the type of true upside to go after this off-season. I've been calling him a target since his signing year, and now is certainly the time to strike even in shallower leagues. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/28/82/.251/.338/.487/5

436) Harry Ford - SEA, C, 22.1 - Ford is just not hitting the ball hard enough to feel comfortable flying him up the rankings with only 7 homers in 116 games at Double-A. It's not a hard and fast line, but if you don't have the power breakout in your age 21 year old season, I start to dock some points on a prospect's future power potential. Even without hitting the ball hard, he still had a very strong season with a 119 wRC+, 35 steals, and a 22.0/14.1 K%/BB% at Double-A. He definitely has more raw juice in his bat than he's shown, so even though I do have his value sliding, it's not like I think a future power breakout can't happen, and if it does, the speed, lift, pull, and plate approach will be there waiting for it. It's uncertain if he can stick at catcher with Seattle playing him in the OF some, but due to his speed, he has the fantasy upside to profile there. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/18/68/.248/.333/.411/21

437) AJ Puk - ARI, Closer Committe, 29.11 - Puk and Justin Martinez seem to be in some kind of closer competition and/or committee, and the tie usually goes to the righty for the lion's share of the job. But in this case, it might not be a tie as Puk is better than Martinez and safer than Martinez. Martinez also has control issues which could tank him (like we saw with Doval and Diaz in 2024), but plenty of elite closers have below average control, so just because the risk of implosion is higher, it doesn't mean it's going to happen. Puk on his own merits is a truly elite relief pitcher with a 1.72 ERA and 35.0/5.1 K%/BB% in 57.2 IP once being transitioned back to the bullpen after a short stint as a starter (which didn't work out). The fastball and slider are elite, and he also throws a good sweeper and sinker. Your guess is as good as mine as to how this situation will shake out, but my gut is telling me to bet on the better reliever, which is Puk, lefty be damned. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.96/1.08/82/23 saves in 65 IP

438) Pete Fairbanks - TBR, Closer, 31.3 - I guess Fairbanks is the favorite for saves in Tampa if he's healthy after saving 23 games in 2024 and 25 saves in 2023, but there are a lot of red flags here. For one, he's never pitched more than 45.1 IP in an MLB season, and his 2024 ended in mid August with a lat strain. He also showed signs of decline in 2024 with a pretty mediocre season compared to his past few years with a 3.57 ERA and 23.8/9.2 K%/BB%. His career K rate is 31.7%, so that is a big drop, and the whiff% dropped majorly too (21.8%), so it doesn't look like an aberration or bad luck. His stuff was still good with a 97.3 MPH fastball, so maybe there is just a weird small sample reliever thing going on. He's a really weird evaluation, and it's even harder with not knowing if he's truly locked into the closer job, or how much leash he is going to get. I'm treading carefully here - 2025 Projection: 3/3.41/1.17/61/24 saves in 55 IP

439) Justin Martinez - ARI, Closer Committee, 23.8 - Martinez is in a competition/committee with AJ Puk, but as I wrote in the Puk blurb, my money is on Puk if I had to choose. Martinez just isn't as good, and the 11.7% BB% and 1.31 WHIP in 72.2 IP shows the added risk which has me leaning Puk. He most certainly has closer stuff with a 100.2 MPH sinker and two whiff machine secondaries in his splitter and slider. It was good for a 2.48 ERA and 29.5% K%. He's the righty, which generally gets the lean when it comes to closers. Just because I think Puk has the edge, doesn't mean it's going to play out like that. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.32/1.27/81/14 saves in 65 IP

440) Orion Kerkering - PHI, Setup, 24.0 - Philly signed Jordan Romano, which knocks Kerkering out of the pole position for saves, and while I do think he's next man up, Philly loves to mix and match, so there are no guarantees of that. Philly had 8 players receive saves and nobody saved more than 13 games last year (Jose Alvarado, who is still on the team). Maybe that means Kerkering can still get saves even if Romano is solid, and I still think Kerkering eventually ascends to the closer of the future role. He's not quite good enough to put in the truly elite tier, but he's not far off. He put up a 2.29 ERA with a 28.8/6.6 K%/BB% in 63 IP. The fastball sat 97.6 MPH and was a plus to double plus weapon with a .261 xwOBA and 27.2% whiff%. The sweeper was his most used pitch with a 55.7% usage, and while it's a good pitch, the 31.1% whiff% and .294 xwOBA aren't eye popping, which is the only thing keeping him out of the truly elite range (for now). And he has plus control, which is a nice bonus for a top end reliever as many of them have high risk walk rates (hello, Camilo Doval and Alexis Diaz). The Romano signing is a hit, but I still like him a lot for dynasty leagues - 2025 Projection: 5/2.87/1.03/79/13 saves in 65 IP

441) Porter Hodge - CHC, Setup, 24.1 - Chicago traded for Pressly, and you have to think Pressly will get the first shot at the job. Maybe he will scuffle, and he's only under contract for one year, but this is a big blow to Hodge's dynasty value. Before adding Pressly, I was really loving Hodge though. He took over the closer job in late August and he ran with it, locking down 8 saves in his final 13 appearances. He was lights out when he got the call to the bigs in late May, putting up a 1.88 ERA with a 31.7/11.6 K%/BB% in 43 IP. The stuff is most certainly closer stuff with the best sweeper in baseball that put up a +11 Run Value (tied with Anthony Bender) with a 51.8% whiff%. The fastball sits 95.5 MPH and put up very good .298 xwOBA. Below average control is the only thing that can tank him, and while plenty of elite closers have below average control, there is still some risk there as we saw with Camilo Doval and Alexis Diaz last year. It seems he's the closer of the future at the least, but Chicago could easily do the same think next off-season that they did this off-season by bringing in a vet, so nothing is guaranteed. Either way, he's a top setup option on his own merits, and there is still a path to saves in both the short and long term. 2025 Projection: 4/3.41/1.18/77/10 saves in 63 IP

442) Sal Frelick - MIL, OF, 24.11 - I honestly thought Frelick would be able to get to more power when I was evaluating him in his draft year, but his power has been true very bottom of the scale with a 83.4 MPH EV and 2 homers in 145 games. This type of profile can work with like a 86+ MPH EV, but an 83+ MPH EV is absolutely brutal. The contact is elite with a 14.9% K% and he has double plus speed with a 29.3 ft/sec sprint, but the extreme lack of power is killing him. It resulted in a .259 BA and 86 wRC+. He also doesn't run as much as you would want this profile to with 18 steals. He's entering his mid 20's, so I do think he can bring that EV up 2+ MPH at peak, and he's a good defensive outfielder, so his glove should keep him on the field. He's got a classic hit/speed/defense profile, but his power needs to level up to keep a starting job in the long run. - 2025 Projection: 73/7/44/.266/.329/.361/20

443) Yu Darvish - SDP, RHP, 38.7 - Darvish pitched only 81.2 IP due to a variety of reasons (groin injury, elbow inflammation, private family issue), but when he was on the mound, he was his usual really good self. He put up a 3.31 ERA with a 23.6/6.6 K%/BB%. The K rate was a career low and has been trending down for years now, so prime Darvish is very clearly in the rear view mirror at 38 years old. He's in his "art of pitching" stage of his career with an 8 pitch mix and plus control. There is also enough juice still in the tank with a 94.1 MPH fastball that he's not just a junk baller quite yet. He can still dial it up when he needs to. He's not a difference maker anymore, but he can still be a key cog of your fantasy rotation for the next season or two. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.73/1.17/149 in 150 IP

444) Max Scherzer - TOR, RHP, 40.8 - We are clearly on the last legs here. Scherzer had an injury filled year (back, thumb, shoulder, hamstring) where he only pitched 43.1 IP, but he's such a legend he was actually still decent with a 3.95 ERA and 22.6/5.6 K%/BB%. The velocity was all the way down to 92.5 MPH, but he still managed an elite 29.2% whiff% on the back of the slider and curve. He has the double plus control to art of pitching his way as a mid rotation starter, but at 40 years old, how long will he want to do that even if he can. It seems he wants to give it go for 2025 at the least though. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.75/1.18/140 in 140 IP

445) Chris Bassitt - TOR, RHP, 36.1 - Bassit has entered the junk balling, mid to back end starter portion of his career. He put up a 4.16 ERA with a 22.2/9.2 K%/BB% in 171.1 IP, and he's been on the decline for a couple years now. At 36 years old, it's unlikely he will return to his #2/3 starter days. He throws an 8 pitch mix led by a 92.5 MPH sinker, so he's definitely the type who can art of pitching his way through his mid to late 30's. - 2025 Projection: 11/4.05/1.28/160 in 170 IP

446) Merrill Kelly - ARI, RHP, 36.6 - Kelly missed almost 4 months of the season with a shoulder strain, and while he was solid when he returned in mid August, it was clearly a diminished version of himself. The velocity was down a tick and the swing and miss was way down with a 21.3% whiff% (27% in 2023). It resulted in a 4.03 ERA with a 21.0/6.3 K%/BB% in 73.2 IP on the season. He was coming off back to back season with an ERA around 3.30, but at 36 years old, it's super hard to count on him for anything more than like a solid #3/4 type starter. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.99/1.22/138 in 150 IP

447) Andrew Heaney - PIT, LHP, 33.10 - Heaney is a solid win now pitcher who has more value the deeper the league is. He can miss bats with an above average 26.3% whiff% and he can throw the ball over the plate with a plus 5.9% BB%. The stuff gets hit hard with a below average Barrel% against his entire career, so he's not going to be a league winner, but he can be a trusty mid rotation guy. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.19/1.28/159 in 155 IP

448) Lucas Giolito - BOS, RHP, 30.9 - Giolito underwent a UCL repair with an internal brace procedure in March 2024 which kept him out for all of 2024, but it seems he could be ready pretty early into 2025. Here was my blurb for him last off-season before we heard about the injury: "Giolito dropped off a cliff in 2022, and he was still at the bottom of the cliff in 2023. He put up a 4.88 ERA with a 25.7%/9.2% K%/BB% in 184.1 IP. His velocity is still down from prime levels with a 93.1 MPH fastball, and his formerly plus changeup and slider are now average-ish." ... now tack on the injury risk and I'm just not super enthused for him. It seems he still has some decent name value holding up his value, so for me, I don't foresee the value being there for me in any league to scoop him. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.33/1.32/124 in 120 IP

449) Brady Singer - CIN, RHP, 28.8 - I'm not buying into the 3.71 ERA in 179.2 IP at all, and now with his move to one of the worst pitcher's parks in the league, I'm not going near him with a ten foot pole. He was already regressing hard to close out the season with a 5.60 ERA in his final 54.2 IP, and the 4.65 xERA tells you to be highly mistrustful of that season ERA. Both his sinker and slider, his two most used pitches by far, got lucky last year and grade out as more average to slightly above average pitches. It's not there is nothing to like, I just see him as a #4 type. Singer's 92.2 MPH sinker was the 7th most valuable sinker in baseball last year, and with Cincinnati's small ballpark, the ability to keep the ball low will only help (career 8.5 degree launch against). The slider can miss bats with a 35.4% whiff%, and the walk rate is above average with a 7.1% BB%. If he had stuck with Kansas City, I could see a case to think he could be a solid mid rotation starter, but with the move to Cincy, he just doesn't have the upside (22.3% K%) to take on that ballpark hit. I'm avoiding him. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.16/1.31/160 in 170 IP

450) Reid Detmers - LAA, LHP, 25.9 - How many times can you fall for the ole banana in the tailpipe trick? (does anybody actually still do this? Come to think of it, do cars even have tailpipes anymore?) Detmers' 3.86 xFIP with a 27.9/9.7 K%/BB% seems so enticing, and seems so juicy to call a target, but these were the same things to draw us in in 2023, and draw us in again at the start of 2024, and we know how that worked out. Not well. He had a 6.70 ERA in 87.1 IP and got demoted to Triple-A where he put up a 5.54 ERA in 78 IP. As discouraging as that is, we all know pitcher development is notoriously fickle, and it taking a young starter a few years before he really figures out how to put it all together, while showing flashes, isn't all that unusual. He has a good arsenal with a 93.8 MPH fastball that missed a lot of bats with a 25.3% whiff%, and his slider was plus with a .254 xwOBA and 36.8% whiff%. He rounds out the arsenal with a curve and change, both of which are below average. To my credit, I knew to be skeptical last off-season, finishing his Top 1,000 blurb by writing, "I like Detmers if he fell into my lap, but I think his perceived value is a bit too high for him to land in the target range for me." His perceived value has sunk like a stone, so I actually don't mind him at all as a later round flier. I think I may just end up with him on a few teams this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.05/1.31/168 in 150 IP

451) Frankie Montas - NYM, RHP, 32.0 - Montas basically missed the entire 2023 season after undergoing shoulder surgery, and he wasn't able to get back to even close to his prime levels in his return in 2024. He put up a 4.84 ERA with a 22.6/10.1 K%/BB% in 150.2 IP. The velocity was down a tick to 95.6 MPH, the control/command was way off, and the 24.9% whiff% was down considerably from prime levels. The silver lining is that the famed splitter was still really good with a 42.6% whiff%, and a 95.6 MPH fastball is still plenty of velocity, so if he can get his control/command back with another year removed from the injury, I do see a path for a better 2025. He was also starting to round into form after getting traded to Milwaukee in the 2nd half, so he gave a hint of the improvement we are looking to see in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.28/1.32/1436in 140 IP Update: Lat injury will keep him out until May

452) Michael Soroka - WSH, RHP, 27.8 - Here is what I wrote about Soroka after his latest spring outing, "4 IP, 4 hits, 1 ER, 6/0 K/BB. The outings get longer, the lineups get realer-ish (about 70% of the Cardinals read lineup), and Soroka just gets on locking in that he is for real. The fastball was still sitting 94.6 MPH, up 1.1 MPH from 2024. The slider, which was a dominant, whiff machine pitch in 2024, is so legit with a 60% whiff%, and the sinker and changeup missed bats too, leading to a 41% whiff% overall. He now has a 1.29 ERA with a 37.5/4.2 K%/BB% in 7 IP. Really the biggest problem in 2024 for Soroka was his control (12.7% BB%), but he showed much better control when he first came up in the majors, and it sure looks damn good right now too. Both his slider and fastball were good pitches in 2024, and if he can maintain even some of this velo spike, they might be even better in 2025. And the sinker and change are showing signs of life too. I'm really starting to buy in here. Soroka is definitely a "star next to his name" player for me in the late rounds of drafts at this point." 2025 Projection: 9/4.14/1.31/131 in 140 IP

453) Casey Mize - DET, RHP, 27.11 - Mize cracks this list for past pedigree and the fact he seemingly has a rotation spot, but that is all. And even the rotation spot is now tenuous after they signed Flaherty. On his own merits, I'm not sure he really deserves to be on here after putting up a 4.49 ERA with a 17.3/6.4 K%/BB% in 102.1 IP. He's never put up a K% better than 19.5% in his 4 year career. He's bad. He throws hard with a 95.5 MPH 4-seamer, and the control is above average, but it's just not working out. None of his pitches are good. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.17/1.32/119 in 130 IP Update: Mize has looked good this spring with refinement on all of his pitches. He's locking in a rotation spot and a late 20's breakout is far from crazy for this type of talent. He gets a bump

454) Max Meyer - MIA, RHP, 26.1 - Meyer is why I have some standards when it comes to who I want to take the Tommy John discount on. He landed kinda inbetween for me. He wasn't established on the MLB level and he wasn't an elite pitching prospect, but he was a very good pitching prospect and he was established in the upper minors, so I didn't write him off completely. Maybe I should have though as his 2024 was quite bad with a 5.68 ERA and 18.5/7.7 K%/BB% in 57 MLB IP. He ended the season on the IL with shoulder bursitis. The 94.1 MPH fastball was simply terrible, the changeup was bad, and while the famed slider was good, it wasn't great with a .241 xwOBA and 34.2% whiff%. With only about average control, having one good, but not great pitch is just not going to get it done. He was coming off major surgery and it was his first extended taste of the bigs, so he should obviously only go up from here, but it seems the upside is more like a #3/4 guy. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.38/1.36/118 in 140 IP

455) Aaron Ashby - MIL, LHP, 26.10 - Ashby underwent shoulder surgery in April 2023 and didn't truly get back to full health until late May/early June of this year. Even with his stuff back, he still struggled mightily with his control as a starter in the minors, but once they transitioned him to the bullpen, all hell broke loose. He immediately dominated in the role at Triple-A, and then he rolled it right into the majors with a 1.37 ERA and 36.8/3.9 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP. The sinker sat 96.2 MPH and put up a .291 xwOBA with a 2 degree launch. His changeup (37% whiff%), curveball (42.9% whiff%) and slider (43.8% whiff%) all racked up whiffs. If they keep him in the pen, it's quite clear he can be a truly elite reliever, but if they decide to put him back in the rotation, he would certainly be one of the leading candidates to go all Garrett Crochet on us. Even as a starter, the velocity was averaging between 94-95 MPH by the end of May. Due to the injuries and control problems as a starter, they may never make that move, but he has the pitch mix for it, and it's not like Milwaukee has a stacked rotation, so they may have to give it a go out of necessity at some point. Either way, Ashby is looking like a great target this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.72/1.27/111 in 95 IP Update: Oblique injury will put him on the IL to start the year, but as injuries happen during the season, I still think he gets his shot eventually

456) Nick Gonzales - PIT, 2B, 25.10 - Gonzales is the front runner to be Pittsburgh's starting 2B in 2025, and while he does have competition in Nick Yorke and ultimately Termarr Johnson, he has an exciting enough skillset to mark him as one your cheap, low end targets. His hit tool took a monster step forward this year with a 16.2% K and .356 BA in 34 games at Triple-A, which he backed up in the majors with a 19.1% K%, 24.9% whiff%, and .270 BA in 94 games. It sat at 26.6% at Triple-A in 2023. His power also ticked up with a 90.8 MPH EV at Triple-A and an above average 7.9% Barrel% with a decent 87.9 MPH EV in the majors. He had a 87.4 MPH EV at Triple-A in 2023. He can also lift the ball with a 13 degree launch, so he should get the most out of his average, maybe slightly above average power at peak. And he's damn fast with a near elite 29.2 ft/sec sprint, although he's not a big base stealer. His numbers in the majors don't jump off the page with 7 homers, 5 steals, and a 94 wRC+ in 94 games, and I do think that shows there might not be big upside in here, but I definitely think he has the potential to be a useful fantasy bat, especially in deeper leagues. He's also a good defensive 2B who can play some SS in a jam, so his glove could be the separator which keeps him on the field. - 2025 Projection: 66/17/75/.260/.318/.419/8

457) Spencer Horwitz - PIT, 1B/2B, 27.5 - With Vlad locked in at 1B, and Toronto giving up on Horwitz as a 2B, Horwitz looked like a bench bat in Toronto, so this move to Pitt with their 1B job wide open is a nice bump in value for Horwitz. He's now the favorite for the lion's share of that job. He struggled hard vs. lefties in 2024, so it's likely a strong side of a platoon role, and he doesn't really have the power you want for a 1B, so he's still not a target for me, but at least he's now more interesting in medium to deeper leagues. He proved his bat will play in his rookie year, slashing .265/.357/.433 with 12 homers, 0 steals, and a 18.4/11.0 K%/BB% in 97 MLB games. The 8% Barrel% was above average, and the 88.2 MPH EV was solid. The problem is still that he's a 1B/DH with moderate power at best and a good but not great hit tool. The bat speed is well below average and the sprint speed is in the bottom 7% of the league. He's also already 27 years old. The upside just isn't very high. - 2025 Projection: 58/12/52/.260/.338/.417/2 Update: Underwent wrist surgery which is not a recipe for a big season, and it's likely to land him on the IL to start the season

458) Ryne Nelson - ARI, RHP, 27.2 - Nelson would have been an interesting pitcher this off-season, but it seems like he's the 7th starter in Arizona, and I don't personally like him enough to really wait for him to get into the rotation, so he's not one of my guys. He had a big 2nd half of the season with a 3.05 ERA and 24.8/5.0 K%/BB% in 82.2 IP. He did it on the back of a heavily used 95.2 MPH fastball that put up a +7 Run Value on the season. The problem is that his secondaries are awful with not a single one of them putting up an over 20.3% whiff% (he has 5 secondaries). The 18.2% whiff% overall is extremely light. He just doesn't miss enough bats for me, and without a rotation spot, I'm staying away. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.12/1.25/110 in 130 IP

459) Joey Cantillo - CLE, LHP, 25.3 - I've always had Cantillo as around a #4 upside type, and while I still have him pegged in that area, his performance in the majors showed he has the goods to beat that projection. He put up a 4.89 ERA (3.83 xERA) with a 27.0/9.2 K%/BB% in 38.2 IP. The 92.2 MPH fastball got hit hard, but it was able to miss bats with a 22% whiff%. The changeup was straight elite with a .207 xwOBA and 43.7% whiff%. The lesser used curve and slider also performed real well with above average xwOBA's and bat missing ability. It led to a 31.1% whiff% overall, which is elite for a starter. The fastball is below average and the control is below average, which is why I've been hesitant to buy in, but proving he can miss that many bats on the MLB level is exciting. He doesn't seem to have a rotation spot at the moment, but he can certainly win one, and I'm sure he'll get plenty of innings regardless. I didn't think I was going to like Cantillo a ton coming into this blurb, but I'm digging him. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.18/1.33/103 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.78/1.29/164 in 150 IP

460) Nick Yorke - PIT, 2B, 23.0 - Yorke was quietly smashing the ball all season at Triple-A with a 91.5 MPH EV, and then he got called up to the majors and put up a 15.4% Barrel%, 89.7 MPH EV, and a .383 xwOBA in 42 PA. He's damn fast with a double plus 28.9 ft/sec sprint, he has a strong plate approach (24.4% Chase%), and he has a potentially above average to plus hit tool (.333 BA with a 18.9/12.2K%/BB% at AAA, plus a .290 xBA in the majors). I want to get really damn excited and tell you to target him everywhere, but there are a few things which I can't just gloss over. He has a mostly line drive approach, so the game power isn't huge right now, and he's not a great base stealer, so he's not going to rack up steals either. Really his biggest issue is that he isn't a good defensive player. Nick Gonzales is the better defender and he had a relatively exciting year as well, so he's the favorite for the job in the short term, and Termarr Johnson is the favorite to man 2B in the long run. That leaves Yorke as a utility type (he played 2B, OF, and 3B this year). Injuries happen and the cream generally rises to the top, so if Yorke hits, and I think he will, he is very likely to find plenty of at bats in 2025. Without being the favorite for a full time job, I wouldn't be willing to really reach for him, but I will be hoping to scoop him up on the cheap everywhere I can. - 2025 Projection: 46/11/51/.252/.308/.403/10 Prime Projection: 81/18/73/.273/.334/.430/14

461) Yoeilin Cespedes - BOS, SS/2B, 19.7 - Cespedes' season ended on June 21st a broken hamate, but he was one of the top rookie ball breakouts before going down with the injury. He slashed .319/.400/.615 with 5 homers, 3 steals, and a 18.1/11.4 K%/BB% in 25 games. It was good for a 163 wRC+, and this was coming off the 145 wRC+ he put up in the DSL in 2023. He's a lift and pull machine who takes absolute daddy hacks at the dish with a monster righty swing. He swings much bigger than his 5'8'' size would indicate. I'm thinking the contact rates could take a step back in full season ball, but I believe in the power despite not being a huge human being. If the contact rates don't take a step back, we could be looking at a very potent hit/power combo, and even if they do, he should remain a very good prospect. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/25/84/.268/.329/.458/8

462) Alex Freeland - LAD, SS, 23.7 - I'm pretty certain I'm the only one crazy enough to have called Freeland a target in his FYPD class after getting drafted 105th overall, but you know how strongly I feel about good pro debuts (and bad pro debuts), even in small samples, and Freeland had himself a hell of a pro debut with a 152 wRC+, 3 homers, and 2 steals in 8 games in rookie ball. That was enough for me to target him late, and look at him just two years later, getting major mainstream hype. Please ignore the fact that he actually didn't crack my 2024 Top 1,000 after his lukewarm year in 2023 ;) ... but my point still stands, pro debuts mean a lot, and certainly when you are looking for late round sleepers. And now that he is getting rained down with hype, I hate to be that guy, but I think he might be getting overrated now. A lot of his damage and hype came from dominating High-A in 23 games, but he was 22 year old and repeating the level. He was good at Double-A too with a 127 wRC+, but a .245/.370/.422 triple-slash isn't exactly blowing the doors off, and he struggled at Triple-A, slashing .243/.335/.396 with a 26.8% K% and 85 wRC+ in 39 games. The bottom line is that he hit under .250 at the age appropriate levels of the upper minors with a pretty high strikeout rate. He has very real hit tool risk. But enough raining on his parade. He's definitely exciting with an above average to plus power/speed combo, jacking out 18 homers with 31 steals in 136 games. He hits the ball hard and he's fast, so those numbers aren't a mirage. He also has a good infield glove, so his glove should only help him get in the lineup. Whenever a former deep sleeper blows up, they will always hold a fond place in my heart, but perceived value shifts, and my feelings on a player have to shift with percieved value. Right now, I think he might be a tad overrated even though I still like him. - 2025 Projection: 17/3/19/.229/.293/.378/5 Prime Projection: 77/19/71/.248/.324/.421/21

463) Franklin Arias - BOS, SS/2B, 19.4 - I have Arias in the same category that I had Jefferson Rojas in last off-season when Rojas was getting a ton of hype. They don't jump off the screen, they don't have huge size, and they don't have huge tools, but they are just really good baseball players who do a lot of things well on a baseball field. I like them, and I definitely like them for real life, but they are probably a bit overrated for fantasy. Arias demolished rookie ball with a 181 wRC+ on the back of elite plate skills with a 17.5/16.5 K%/BB% in 51 games. He then got the call to Single-A and wasn't as impressive, slashing .257/.311/.378 with 3 homers, 5 steals, and a 17.5/9.6 K%/BB% in 36 games. He was only 18, so that is still a very solid line, but I do think it underscores how the production might not look so outsized against more advanced competition. He hit 9 homers in 87 games, so he has some pop, and he stole 35 bags, so a he's a good baserunner despite not being a burner. An up the middle glove with good contact rates and some power and speed is a really high floor real life profile, but we play fantasy, and we want upside. He's a Top 100-ish fantasy prospect, so again, I like him, but I don't think he's a truly coveted one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 83/18/68/.273/.338/.428/15

464) Demetrio Crisantes - ARI, 2B, 20.7 - Crisantes doesn't necessarily jump off the screen when you watch him, but he has a very quick and controlled righty swing, which he combines with plus plate skills, that has resulted in him raking everywhere he's played. He made it to Single-A by the 2nd half of the season and slashed .333/.429/.478 with 6 homers, 20 steals, and a 15.9/12.9 K%/BB% in 63 games. He can hit the ball relatively hard, and there is room to tack on more mass at 6'0'', 178 pounds. The swing is geared more for average than power right now, he's not a true burner, so the steal totals could come down against more advanced competition, and many of the best players at Single-A got promoted by the time he hit the league (that one is a very small one, but it's something knocking around in my brain on 2nd half lines at Single-A). I like him, but I wouldn't go too crazy for him quite yet. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/18/73/.272/.331/.427/20

465) Druw Jones - ARI, OF, 21.4 - Jones got his career back on track after a disastrous pro debut in 2023, but it still wasn't a particularly impressive year considering what we expected out of him after getting drafted 2nd overall. He went back to Single-A and slashed .275/.409/.405 with 6 homers, 21 steals, and a 28.0/18.0 K%/BB% in 109 games. It was good for a 125 wRC+. The strikeout rate is way to high for a 20 year old at Single-A, and so is the 57.2% GB%. Even with a .409 OBP, he still only stole 21 bags in 26 attempts, and with speed now looking like the main selling point here, that really isn't that impressive. All of the raw tools and bloodlines that got him drafted so highly are still there at a projectable 6'4'', 180 pounds with a plus raw power/speed combo, but he still looks so raw out there. He needs to refine his game in every aspect (other than defense, where he is a plus CF, which will help get him on the field for sure). Right now he looks on track to be more of a mid 20's breakout candidate, which isn't what you want when you draft a high schooler 2nd overall, but that is where we are at. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/17/67/.247/.320/.429/22

466) Jake McCarthy - ARI, OF, 27.8 - McCarthy has improved his strikeout rate every year of his career, and it reached a career best 15.8% in 2024. That improvement puts him on the radar as a possible true everyday guy who will hit for contact and rack up steals, but unfortunately, he has competition for that job, and I'm not so sure I want to bet on him winning it. Alek Thomas is right behind him, and Thomas has equally as good contact rates and he hits the ball much harder. McCarthy sacrificed power to get those contact gains with a career worst 84.5 MPH EV. There are also other alignments Arizona could use that would push McCarthy out. I would like him more if I was sure had a lock on the job, because the speed is elite with a 29.8 ft/sec sprint and 25 steals in 495 PA, but with the lack of job security, and lack of hard hit, I can only put him so high. - 2025 Projection: 68/9/57/.265/.331/.392/29

467) Willi Castro - MIN, OF/3B/2B/SS, 27.11 - Castro is a super utility player who was an overall positive on defense (+3.9 Fangraphs value), he hits at the top of the order, scoring 89 runs, and he amassed a ton of at bats with 635 PA. The nature of his everyday role feels a bit precarious long term, but short term it does seem likely he will get a ton of at bats again. He wasn't able to maintain his outlier steal season in 2023 (33 steals), coming back down to earth with 14 in 23 attempts, and he doesn't hit for much power (12 homers with a 87.4 MPH EV) or hit for a high BA (.247 BA with a 23.6% K%). He's optimally getting more like 400-500 PA per season, and not 600+, but right now, it does seem like his path to 600+ is still there. I'm not too intrigued by him in dynasty except in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 77/13/58/.250/.330/.397/17

468) Joe Mack - MIA, C, 22.3 - Mack is a former 1st round high school catcher who had his power breakout in his age 21 year old season, cracking 24 homers in 125 games at mostly Double-A. A lot of 21 year old's have that power breakout as juniors in college, while Mack had his at Double-A. It resulted in a well above average 129 wRC+. He's built like a catcher at a strong 6'0'', 210 pounds with a powerful lefty swing, and he's known as a good defensive player. Since Agustin Ramirez' catcher defense is shaky, Mack very well might be the odds on favorite to be the Marlins catcher of the future. And they can certainly share the position with Ramirez getting at bats at 1B/DH as well. The 25.7/9.7 K%/BB% shows there is hit tool risk, so he likely profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher. - 2025 Projection: 10/4/14/.218/.283/.392/0 Prime Projection: 53/21/64/.242/.313/.431/2

469) Jeferson Quero - MIL, C, 22.6 - Quero underwent season ending shoulder surgery on his throwing shoulder just 1 PA into 2024. Shoulders are important for hitting, and they are also very important defensively for a catcher. It definitely adds in some risk that needs to be taken into account. He's also very clearly blocked by William Contreras who isn't a free agent until 2028, and I don't think Milwaukee is going to have any urgency to move either of these guys, so Quero might have to wait until 2028 to take over the starting catcher job. Injuries and playing time aside though, Quero is an excellent catcher prospect with an above average hit/power combo and good defense. He hit 16 homers with a 17.8/10.0 K%/BB% in 90 games at Double-A in 2023. He can easily be a top 10 fantasy catcher at peak, and there is top 5 upside as well. If there was a clear path to playing time, I would rank him considerably higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 11/4/15/.245/.304/.408/1 Prime Projection: 65/20/74/.268/.329/.448/4

470) Endy Rodriguez - PIT, C, 24.10 - Endy underwent Tommy John surgery in December 2023, and he wasn't able to get back on the field until September 10th for a rehab assignment in the minors. In his absence, Joey Bart was able to nail down at least the first shot at the starting catcher job in 2025, which puts Endy in a weird spot. His bat doesn't really have big upside, so while Endy can potentially play other positions, I'm not sure that is a big help for us. He's not the type to smash the ball, but the plate approach is plus, he has some speed, and he can lift and pull, so he can be a nice all category contributor at catcher if he does end up winning the job in the end. This will be a competition that surely goes into the season. May the best man win (including Henry Davis). - 2025 Projection: 39/8/36/.241/.309/.394/4 Prime Projection: 72/16/66/.263/.338/.426/9

471) Thayron Liranzo - DET, C, 21.9 - The trade to Detroit must have lit a fire under Liranzo, because he went from hitting 7 homers with a .700 OPS in 74 games at High-A for LA, to jacking out 5 homers with a 1.031 OPS in 26 games for Detroit. He's also decimating the AFL with a 1.158 OPS in 15 games. He came over in the Jack Flaherty trade along with Trey Sweeney, so you know Detroit loved this kid, and he proved them correct very quickly. He's a big boy at 6'2'' with a powerful swing from both sides of the plate. He's not a lock to stick behind the plate, but he has the bat to profile at 1B/DH, and I don't think Detroit makes this trade if they thought he couldn't stick there. Detroit doesn't have a strong organizational catcher depth chart at all, so they have every reason to stick with him there. He profiles as your classic low BA slugging catcher if he sticks. He's less exciting as a 1B/DH prospect, but still not a bad prospect there either. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/24/73/.242/.323/.460/2

472) Eduardo Tait - PHI, C, 18.7 - Tait started his career as a 16 year old in 2023 ... we think. Baseball has been catching players lie about their ages more and more, and lying about your age has really always been a thing in spots. I remember back in 2021 the Danny Almonte Little League World Series controversy where he ended up being two years older than claimed. I always assumed it was kinda an open secret that teams knew the players real ages internally, and it seems MLB is now trying to crack down on it. It's always something I had in the back of my mind, but it's never something I took into account when ranking players. I can't just make wild speculations on which players are older than they claim, and beyond that, try to guess how much older. It just seems like too many wild goose chases, witch hunts, etc ... and it's just not something I want to poison my love for the game and prospects with. I want to get excited about these players, not think about them with a cloud of suspicion. I'm not using the Tait blurb to say all this for any reason other than being a professional baseball player at 16 years old is cool as hell, ha, and not only that, he's a damn good one. He ripped up the DSL in 2023, and then he came stateside in 2024 and just kept on raking. He smacked 6 homers with a 14.6% K% and 132 wRC+ in 51 games in rookie ball, and then he got the call to Single-A and crushed 5 homers with a 28.9% K% and 117 wRC+ in 28 games. He did this as a 17 year old. He's a thick 6'0'' with a whip quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. There are questions if he can stick behind the plate and he chases a lot, so plenty of refinement is still needed, but who didn't need refinement at 17 years old. He's a really good candidate to be one of the best offensive catcher prospects in the game in the next 1-2 years. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 64/24/77/.260/.318/.450/3

473) Blake Mitchell - KCR, C, 20.8 - It was a bit of a head scratcher when the Royals selected Mitchell 8th overall, and while I still question the pick a bit, Mitchell proved he is an excellent catcher prospect in his first full year of pro ball. He slashed .238/.376/.439 with 18 homers, 25 steals, and a 30.5/17.0 K%/BB% in 106 games at Single-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+. He has a quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to lift and pull, giving him considerable power upside at peak, and while he's not a burner, the 25 steals show how good of an athlete he is. He should at least chip in there. Of course, the big question is the hit tool. If he can just get to below average, he can be your classic low BA slugging catcher, but there is no guarantee he can get to that. Add a star in OBP leagues because he walks a ton, but the hit tool is going to have to show improvement no matter what. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/25/74/.227/.314/.438/9

474) Bryan Ramos - CHW, 3B, 23.1 - Ramos did not have a good MLB debut with a .586 OPS in 32 games, and he didn't play particularly well in the minors either with a 98 wRC+ in 64 games at Triple-A, but like I mentioned in the Montgomery blurb, there is still a collection of skills here that I'm buying. Despite the poor MLB debut, he put up a 20.4% K%, 25.5% Chase%, a 90.1 MPH EV, an 11.8 degree launch, and a 28.7 ft/sec sprint speed. For a bad debut, that is a damn good collection of numbers. He was also getting hot at Triple-A towards the end of his stay there with 7 homers and a .894 OPS in his final 37 games, which shows you to not get too hung up on the down minor league numbers either. Chicago has nothing but opportunity, so they are going to give him every chance to establish himself. He might not be a league winner, but 20+ homers with a decent BA and a handful of steals is more than useful in most fantasy leagues. - 2025 Projection: 41/13/52/.233/.292/.403/4 Prime Projection: 71/23/80/.252/.318/.450/8

475) Tyler Locklear - SEA, 1B, 23.8 - Locklear's hit tool fell off a cliff in his MLB debut with a .156 BA, 40.8% K%, and 37% whiff% in 49 PA. It's a small sample, and you have to give him time to adjust to the highest level, but it's really not what you want to see. He's not the type of prospect that is just going to be handed a job, so he's going to have to start hitting pretty quickly if he wants to lock in a full time role anytime soon. He's also in a terrible hitter's park, which will subdue his offensive stats to begin with. He has plus power with 16 homers in 111 games in the upper minors, and he even had an above average 8% Barrel% in the majors, so he can certainly make an impact, but the power isn't really off the charts. Combined with the ballpark and hit tool issues, the reasonable ceiling here is likely more of a solid fantasy bat than a great one, and that is assuming he can win a job eventually. Seattle currently has opportunity at both 1B and DH, so he could earn that opportunity in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 35/11/42/.230/.302/.402/2 Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.251/.332/.448/5

476) CJ Kayfus - CLE, 1B, 23.5 - I just realized that I have the same birthday as CJ Kayfus! Let's go Scorpios! That has to be worth at least a few spots in the rankings ;) But you don't need to have the same birthday to appreciate the season Kayfus just had. He obliterated High-A (188 wRC+ in 40 games), and then he proved the skills will transfer to Double-A with 10 homers, a 139 wRC+ and 28.2/12.1 K%/BB% in 67 games. He has one of the sweetest lefty swings out there which helps his solid but not great raw power play up at 6'0'', 192 pounds. He's not an extreme lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull it. The strikeout rate jumping so high at Double-A is a little concerning, because he doesn't have big defensive value, and like I mentioned, the raw power isn't off the charts. He's a good 1B and he can play some corner outfield, so there is at lest some defensive value there. He has the type of bat you want to bet on, but Cleveland has a ton of competition for at bats at his positions, and his profile isn't bulletproof enough to completely overlook that. He's a fringy Top 100 prospect for me. - 2025 Projection: 16/5/19/.239/.308/.407/1 Prime Projection: 75/23/79/.252/.331/.447/6

477) Tre’ Morgan - TBR, 1B/OF, 22.9 - The only stop of Morgan's career where he had less than a .316 BA was when he got to Double-A in late August. He put up a .211 BA in 21 games. His K% also jumped up to 18.7% from 7.8% at High-A. There isn't high upside here with a moderate power/speed combo at best, so seeing him immediately struggle harder than he ever has the first time he faced advanced competition isn't great. Don't get me wrong, I still think he can be a solid MLB bat, but if the hit tool is only good and not great, I just don't see how he can be a true impact fantasy player. He also struggled hard vs lefties (.521 OPS), so especially with Tampa, it looks likely he will be in a platoon role. This blurb ended up being much more negative than even I expected, because at the end of the day, I do believe this guy is going to hit at any level. I'm just worried about the upside. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/14/66/.280/.336/.422/13

478) Luke Adams - MIL, 3B, 20.11 - Everything I liked about Adams when I named him a deep FYPD sleeper in 2022/23, I still like about him now. He's 6'4''. 210 pounds with plus raw power, good athleticism, and a plus approach. And he keeps proving the profile will transfer one level at a time. He conquered High-A in 2024 with a 154 wRC+, 11 homers, 28 steals and a 21.3/18.7 K%/BB% in 101 games. While there is a lot to like, you can pretty easily build a case against him too. He still hasn't fully tapped into that raw power, he's not a true burner and he gets caught stealing a solid amount (10 CS), and the hit tool has been pretty bad with a .227 BA in 2024 and .233 BA in 2023. It's not hard to see this profile start to fall apart a bit when he gets to the upper minors, and then ultimately the majors. That is why seeing him prove it at Double-A in 2025 is going to be a big step, and only then can his hype really explode into Top 100 prospect range. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/20/76/.252/.333/.441/14

479) James Triantos - CHC, 2B, 22.2 - Triantos ran a ton in 2024, stealing 47 bags in 115 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. I'm leading with that because it gives his profile an upside boost which he needed for fantasy. The contact rates have consistently ranged from plus to elite throughout his minor league career, putting up an 11.1 K% this season, but both the game power and raw power are well below average. He put up a 85.9 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 2 degree launch. He doesn't walk much with a 5.6% BB%, which isn't great for his chances to hit at the top of the lineup, and he's not really an asset on defense as a solid 2B. The hit/speed combo is certainly good enough to make him a good fantasy prospect, but lack of impact, OBP and defense keeps him just outside the Top 100. - 2025 Projection: 19/2/11/.260/.303/.365/7 Prime Projection: 81/11/52/.282/.328/.408/26

480) Seaver King - WAS, SS, 21.11 - You know how I often say that if you hit it hard, hit if often, and are fast that good things tend to happen, well, that is King's game to a T. Selected 10th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 195 pound King has a lightning quick swing that is very powerful, controlled and produces very hard contact. He can spray hard liners all over the field. He combines that with plus to double plus speed with 31 steals in 33 attempts in 149 career college games. And finally, tack on tons of contact with a 12% K% in 60 games in the SEC. That is a profile that consistently makes things happen on a baseball field. There isn't a ton of game power because of his hitting profile, but he still jacked out 16 homers in college, and he's an aggressive hitter with high chase rates. That profile completely transferred to Single-A, both the good (.295 BA, 14.4% K%, and 10 steals in 20 games), and the bad (0 homers with a 53.8% GB%). The hit tool and speed give him a high floor, and if he can raise his launch, the raw power is in there to give him some legit upside too. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 87/16/69/.274/.330/.427/26

481) Slade Caldwell - ARI, OF, 18.9 - Selected 29th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, of course it was the Diamondbacks to jump on the 5'6'' Caldwell at the end of the first round. They were also the team to jump on the undersized Corbin Carroll when he fell in his draft year. Little guys falling in the draft is a tale as old as time, and Arizona recognizes a good thing in a small package when they see one. Caldwell is basically the exact replica of Jett Williams from the 2022 draft, except he's a lefty. He may be short, but he is not weak with a very built up frame and the ability to hit the ball pretty damn hard. He unleashes some explosive lefty swings, but as you can tell from the comps, what you are buying is the elite hit/speed combo. The plate approach is top of the class, he makes tons of contact, and the speed is double plus. He's also super young for the class. Buy the little man discount. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 89/14/68/.284/.355/.423/30

482) Ryan Waldschmidt - ARI, OF, 22.6 - Selected 31st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Waldschmidt is a rock solid 6'2'', 205 pounds with a howitzer of a righty upper cut swing. He hits the ball hard, he's a good athlete who loves to run, and he has a strong plate approach. He slashed .333/.469/.610 with 14 homers, 25 steals, and a 16.5%/15.0% K%/BB% in 59 games in the SEC. It's probably more of a solid across the board profile rather than a truly standout one on the MLB level, but he's yet another really enticing college bat in a class full of really enticing college bats. And his strong pro debut made me like him even more with a 142 wRC+, 4 steals, and 13.6/22.7 K%/BB% in 14 games at Single-A. It's a good sign that the solid across the board profile will play, and while it came with 0 homers, the 36.1% GB% and 51.4% Pull% shows the power should be fine. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 80/18/76/.265/.339/.438/19

483) Carson Benge - NYM, OF, 22.2 - Selected 19th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'1'', 181 pound Benge is lean, loose and mean at the dish with a quick and athletic lefty swing that most certainly looks the part. He slashed .335/.444/.665 with 18 homers, 10 steals, and a 16.8%/16.1% K%/BB% in 61 games in the Big 12. He then stepped right into pro ball and impressed with 2 homers, 3 steals, a 20.3/15.9 K%/BB% and a 152 wRC+ in 15 games at Single-A. It came with a solid 88.3 MPH EV and a 51.2 GB%, so a bit of a mixed bag there. He's the type that does everything well on a baseball field with bouncy athleticism, bat speed, power, mature plate approach, and he even pitches too. He profiles as an average to above average across the board player with the upside to beat that projection. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/20/77/.267/.334/.440/16

484) Jurrangelo Cijntje - SEA, RHP/LHP, 21.10 - Selected 15th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Cijntje is a switch pitcher who will most likely pitch exclusively righty in the majors. He's only 5'11'', 200 pounds but he has a very easy and athletic delivery. The ball effortlessly explodes out of his hand with mid to upper 90's heat. He combines the juice with a bat missing slider and solid changeup. It all resulted in a 3.67 ERA with a 29.9%/7.9% K%/BB% in 90.2 IP in the SEC. Seattle has been a machine of late in developing impact fantasy starters (their impossible to hit in ballpark does a lot of that heavy lifting too), so you have to love this landing spot for him, and it shows how much they liked him by passing up Yesavage for him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 11/3.84/1.25/170 in 170 IP

485) Griffin Burkholder - PHI, OF, 19.7 - Selected 63rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Burkholder is a strong and physical 6'2'', 195 pounds with double plus speed, potentially plus power, and a good feel to hit. He's definitely the type of explosive athlete to jump off the screen with electric bat speed, and that explosiveness shined through in just one single game in his pro debut. He went 1 for 2 with a triple, and tell me you don't get exited just watching that. He still needs to learn to tap into his raw power and there are still questions on just how good the hit tool will be, but this is a very enticing high school bat with legit upside. He's a definite target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 84/20/76/.257/.328/.443/28

486) Hye-seong Kim - LAD, 2B, 26.2 - It's funny that I just had Kim and Lux ranked back to back in the 2B rankings, with Kim one spot ahead, and it looks like the Dodgers agreed with me. They preferred Kim to Lux at 2B too after they signed Kim and shipped out Lux to Cincinnati. Kim signed a 3 year, $12.5 million contract with the Dodgers, but he got better offers elsewhere. Smart move going to the best situation rather than taking the best offer. Kim's contact/speed/defense profile is one that plenty of starting 2B have, and I think it will play in the majors. He slashed .326/.383/.458 with 11 homers, 30 steals, and a 10.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 127 games in the KBO. We can look at Jung Hoo Lee as a comp who just came over last year. Both are lefties and the same age with similar profiles. Lee is 2 inches taller, had much better contact rates, much better walk rates, and much better power numbers. He didn't run nearly as much though, and steals are a huge part of fantasy, so that is a nice edge to Kim. Kim isn't as good as Lee overall, but Lee's skills more or less transferred to the bigs, so I don't see why Kim's couldn't too. Just check out this homer he hit in 2023. I would say that swing could play. It seems like he has a full time job at the moment (although nothing is certain until the off-season is over), and as I wrote in the 2B rankings, if he ended up with a full time job, I'm apt to go after him. Even better that he ended up with one on the Dodgers - 2025 Projection: 41/5/33/.260/.307/.372/14 Prime Projection: 77/10/61/.273/.321/.398/26 Update: The Dodgers decided to change Kim's swing to add more power, and they are going to start him at Triple-A to get more used to it. I still really like Kim long term, but part of this ranking was that he could be their starting 2B out of camp, and that clearly isn't happenning

487) Jackson Ferris - LAD, LHP, 21.3 - I definitely like Ferris a lot, and was quick to jump on him during the season last year, but I don't love the K/BB taking such a huge step back when he got to Double-A. He put a 3.39 ERA with a 29.2/10.5 K%/BB% in 98.1 IP at High-A and a 2.54 ERA with a 21.3/11.5 K%/BB% in 28.1 IP at Double-A. The stuff is good, but it's not really standout with a low to mid 90's fastball, two good breaking balls, and a lesser used, but good change. He gets a lot of "looks the part" extra hype as a 6'4'', 195 pound lefty with an athletic delivery, but as is, it might be a back end profile. The reason why I was so quick to jump on him, and why he gets lots of love, is because we try to project who a player could be in the prospect world, and at his young age with his projectable frame, you can definitely dream on a mid rotation starter or better with an extra tick on the fastball and continued refinement. Again, I like him a lot, but I would be hesitant to put too high a value on him right now. I'm staying a little cautious here. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.88/1.27/162 in 165 IP

488) Griffin Jax - MIN, Setup, 30.4 - Jax' velocity increased every year of his career, going from 92.6 MPH in 2021 (as a starter), to 95.4 MPH in 2022, to 96.5 MPH in 2023, and finally 97.1 MPH in 2024. And it's resulted in him going from good, to one of the best relievers in baseball this year. He put up a 2.03 ERA with a 34.4/5.4 K%/BB% in 71 IP. The 37.8% whiff% backs up the exploding K rate (24.8% K% in 2023). His sweeper (which also jumped 2.1 MPH), 4-seamer and changeup are all plus to double weapons, racking up whiffs, and the control is plus. He was so good that it earned him save chances throughout the entire season, nabbing 10 of them. 4 of them came in the first month of the season when Duran was out, so I don't think this is a committee or anything, but like I mentioned in the Duran blurb, they will mix and match a bit. - 2025 Projection: 6/2.83/0.97/86/9 saves in 67 IP

489) Carlos Estevez - KCR, Closer, 32.3 - Just call him the spoiler, because Estevez keeps taking the closer job from far more fun options. Lucas Erceg was all set to hit the scene as the hot new closer, but no no no, here comes Estevez after signing a 2 year, $22 million deal. You have to think Estevez is the heavy favorite to get the first crack at the closer role, and while he's not a great reliever, he's good enough to hang onto the role. He put up a 2.46 ERA with a 23.6/5.7 K%/BB% in 55 IP. He throws gas with a 96.8 MPH fastball, and he has two good secondaries in his slider and changeup. Maybe Erceg wrangles the role from him mid-season, or maybe I have it wrong and they go with Erceg, but as of now, I'm drafting as if Estevez starts the year as the closer. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.61/1.23/60/24 saves in 60 IP

490) Lucas Erceg - KCR, Setup, 29.11 - KC brought in Estevez, and I have to think that makes Estevez the favorite for the first shot at saves. Estevez isn't great, but he's good enough to hold the job, which is a big hit to Erceg's value, but that doesn't mean I don't like Erceg at all anymore. I was relatively high on him last off-season, ranking him pretty high among non closers, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "Erceg could factor into the saves mix, and he has the big stuff to make an impact if his control can take one step forward. The sinker sat 98 MPH and is a plus, bat missing pitch, to go along with two good bat missing secondaries in his slider and changeup. He got drafted as a hitter in 2016, and only got transitioned to a pitcher in 2021, so there could more upside in the tank here than your average 28 year old." ... not only did his control take one step forward, it took 8 steps forward, improving his walk rate 8 percentage points to a well above average 6.3%. It led to a full on breakout with a 3.36 ERA and a 28.5% K%, culminating with him taking over the full time closer job with Kansas City after he got traded there at the deadline. He throws a devasting 4 pitch mix with two upper 90's fastball and 2 bat missing secondaries. He maintained the control gains all season too, which gives confidence that he can maintain a least a large portion of those gains. Estevez got signed for two years, so it's not even easy enough to say Erceg is the closer of the future. He's going to need Estevez to scuffle, or just be so insanely good himself he gives KC no choice. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.30/1.17/15 saves in 64 IP

491) Edwin Uceta - TBR, Setup, 27.3 - Let's just start with Uceta putting up a 1.51 ERA with a 35.8/5.0 K%/BB% in 41.2 IP. That is straight elite, and if I could fully trust it, I would bet on him passing Fairbanks for the closer role, but you can't really fully bet on it. He wasn't nearly as good at Triple-A with a 5.77 ERA and 29.7/10.1 K%/BB% in 34.1 IP, and he's not your typical flame throwing back end guy with a 94.2 MPH 4-seamer. Now having said that, the guy is a whiff machine. That fastball put up a 36.6% whiff% with a .187 xwOBA, and he the pairs that with an elite changeup that put up a .189 xwOBA and 37.4% whiff%. He also throws a good cutter. Uceta used to be a starter when he started his career in the minors, and honestly, he would be a super fun candidate to transition back into the rotation. The Rays need him more in the pen than in the rotation, so I doubt it happens, but it would be fun. Maybe down the line? But back to the present, if Fairbanks falters, it looks like Uceta is next in line, and while I wouldn't trust the small sample 2024, he could still be very good with legit K upside. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.61/1.22/79/13 saves in 65 IP

492) Ben Joyce - LAA, Setup, 24.7 - Joyce becoming the Angels closer was always his destiny since they selected him 89th overall, fast tracking him through the minors, and he now looks on the precipice of fulfilling that prophesy. He was in the process of locking down the job post trade deadline with 4 saves from August 3rd through September 3rd, but he then suffered a shoulder impingement which ended his season (it doesn't seem like it's serious). And we all know he most certainly has closer stuff, which is a understatement with a 102.1 MPH fastball that dominated MLB hitters with a .269 xwOBA and 29.8% whiff%. His 97.4 MPH sinker is dominant too with a negative 12 degree launch and 25.3% whiff%. The only thing keeping him out of the no doubt elite tier is that his slider isn't all that great. It put up a .339 xwOBA with a 32.1% whiff%, and it wasn't very good in 2023 either. His new changeup was actually really good with a 44.4% whiff%, but he only went to it 3.9% of the time, so maybe he develops that pitch more in 2025. It all resulted in a 2.08 ERA with a 23.2/9.9 K%/BB% in 34.2 IP. The 29% whiff% overall is much better than the K%, so I wouldn't be too worried about that. Control is his biggest problem, and it definitely adds some volatility to the profile, but not enough to scare me off. It would be premature to put him in the elite or even near elite closer range, but he so obviously has the talent to end up there. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.32/1.17/71/6 saves in 62 IP Update: LA signed Jansen for the closer role, which pushed Joyce back into "closer of the future" territory

493) Jeremiah Estrada - SDP, Setup, 26.5 - Estrada is the young gun in San Diego's bullpen, and while he has two vets ahead of him on the depth chart right now, he seems to be the favorite for the closer of the future job. And who knows, maybe he sneaks in there in 2025 too. He just put up a 2.95 ERA with a 37.3/9.1 K%/BB% in 61 IP. The 97.2 MPH fastball is elite with a 32.6% whiff%, the splitter is elite with a 51% whiff%, and the slider is above average. I don't believe he's as good as he showed in 2024, but that really isn't a knock as he was ridiculous in 2024. He has elite reliever potential, but he's not quite established enough to put him in that tier quite yet. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.29/1.17/85/5 saves in 63 IP

494) Enrique Bradfield - BAL, OF, 23.4 - I talked about it in the Strategy Section of the Tampa Bay Rays Team Report, but Enrique Bradfield's profile just isn't one I go out of my way to roster. It's an extreme steals, extremely low power profile that just doesn't fit in with how I build my teams, but if this is a profile you like, Bradfield is a good one to go after. He proved everything will transfer to Double-A in the last 27 games of the season, slashing .287/.395/.396 with 1 homer, 15 steals, and a 11.7/12.5 K%/BB%. He's a good CF, the contact rates are excellent (although they weren't as good at High-A with a 16.6% K% in 81 games), he gets on base, and he's a demon on the bases. He's a CF version of Xavier Edwards, and with Cedric Mullins hitting free agency after this year, it wouldn't be crazy at all to see Bradfield winning the CF job in 2026 and beyond. - 2025 Projection: 19/0/7/.248/.298/.334/8 Prime Projection: 77/6/44/.278/.336/.369/43

495) Chandler Simpson - TBR, OF, 24.5 - Simpson's profile is as extreme as it gets with 1 homer, 104 steals, and a 8.5% K% in 110 games at mostly Double-A. It's a little too extreme for my taste, but he's also a good CF, so if he gets his bat in the lineup, he will be a fantasy difference maker in the steals category. These type of steals only types have never been the type of player I like going after. It creates too much of a hole in the power department for me, but that's not to say they don't have value in the game. Just because it's not my style, doesn't mean you can't make it work. - 2025 Projection: 27/1/12/.253/.303/.326/11 Prime Projection: 76/5/41/.278/.332/.346/46

496) Jonathan Aranda - TBR, 1B, 26.10 - Aranda looks to be headed to a strong side of a platoon role at best, which makes it hard for him to be very enticing for fantasy, but his bat definitely started to get mighty comfortable in the majors last year. He put up a .362 xwOBA with a 16.5% Barrel% and 91.9/98.1 MPH AVG/FB EV in 44 games. It only resulted in 6 homers because he hits the ball on the ground too much with a 50.5% GB%, and he has zero speed with a bottom 14% of the league sprint speed. The plate approach is also only average with a 22.4/8.4 K%/BB%. When you hit the ball that hard, you're interesting, but there are enough other deficiencies here that make me hesitant to buy in too hard. - 2025 Projection: 56/15/59/.252/.329/.430/0

497) Kenley Jansen - LAA, Closer, 37.6 - Jansen is still a free agent, and while it seems likely that he can land a closer job, there is no guarantee of that. He also closed the year with a shoulder issue, which isn't great. He's far from his prime, but he was so insanely good in his prime, that even being a shell of his former self is still a good reliever. He put up a 3.29 ERA with a 28.8/9.2 K%/BB% in 54.2 IP. He does it with basically one pitch at this point, and it's the cutter which put up a 84.9% usage, .298 xwOBA, and 28.2% whiff%. His value will rise or fall depending on where he lands, but even if he does land a closer job, his time is running out. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.58/1.17/66/29 saves in 60 IP Update: He signed with LA, guaranteeing him at least one more season of closing

498) Ryan Pressly - CHC, Closer, 36.3 - Pressly was traded to the Cubs, and while nothing has been announced, my gut says that he will get the first shot at locking down the closer job. It seems the highly paid veteran with a long track record is almost always given precedence over the high octane, up and coming youngster. But just because Pressly is likely to get the first shot, doesn't mean he can't falter, because he's been on the decline for 2 years in a row now, and he'll be 36 years old in the last year of his contract. The fastball velocity was down to 93.8 MPH, which is down about 2 ticks from his prime, and it was continuing to drop as the year went along. The whiffs are also down considerably, dropping from the mid to high 30's in his prime, to 26.9% in 2024. He was still solid with a 3.49 ERA in 56.2 IP, but the 23.8/7.4 K%/BB% isn't as impressive. My guess is that he'll probably be good enough to hang onto the job in 2025, but there is no guarantee of that, and with only 1 more year left on his contract, there is no guarantee of him finding a closer job beyond this season. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.67/1.26/67/25 saves in 60 IP

499) Robert Suarez - SDP, Closer, 34.1 - Suarez is 34 years old, he doesn't put up typical closer K rates with a 22.9% K%, and he struggled in the 2nd half with a 5.66 ERA and 16/7 K/BB in his final 20.2 IP. San Diego has other good options on their team like Jason Adam and Jeremiah Estrada, who are both probably better than Suarez, and there are trade rumors swirling around Suarez too. I'm just saying I'm not so sure Suarez has a super safe hold on the job, and he most certainly is not going to get a very long leash. He still had a really good season with a 2.77 ERA in 65 IP, and he throws gas with a 99.1 MPH 4-seamer, to go along with a lesser used sinker that keeps the ball on the ground and changeup that gets whiffs. He definitely has the goods to hold the job down, I'm just saying there are some cracks in the armor with ready, willing, and able replacements waiting nearby. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.44/1.09/60/22 saves in 65 IP

500) Kyle Finnegan - WSH, Closer, 33.7 - - Finnegan wasn't on this list originally when it looked like Washington was moving on, but neither Washington nor Finnegan could find a better replacement for each other, so he's back as a low end closer option. 2025 Projection: 4/3.72/1.32/61/30 saves in 65 IP

501) Jace Jung - DET, 3B, 24.6 - I called Jung a good prospect to use as trade bait, instead of one you hold before he made his MLB debut this year, and his poor debut showed why. He hit 0 homers with 0 steals, an 86.4 MPH EV, a 26 ft/sec sprint speed, and a 30.9% K%. It's not that I don't think he can be a solid MLB hitter, and his 102 wRC+ and 16% BB% shows very clearly that he can be a solid MLB hitter, it's just that there isn't big fantasy upside. He doesn't hit the ball hard, he's slow, and the hit tool is below average. He can lift and pull it, but both his lift and pull plummeted in the majors, and while that should improve, it's not the best sign. He's also a bad defensive player and he put up a .649 OPS vs. lefties in the minors. His best skill is that he walks a lot, so add a star in OBP leagues, but in general, Jung is not one of my guys. - 2025 Projection: 72/15/65/.238/.318/.402/2 Prime Projection: 82/20/76/.254/.343/.440/3

502) Josh Bell - WSH, 1B, 32.8 - Bell put up a negative 0.1 WAR in 2024 and a 0.4 WAR in 2023. He's put up about average wRC+'s over the last two years. His .310 xwOBA was a career low by far. He should be a veteran bench bat at this point in his career, but it seems he landed a full time role with Washington. He still hits the ball relatively hard, he has above average contact rates, and he was much better in the 2nd half of 2024 with a .885 OPS post break. The deeper the league, the more value he has.. - 2025 Projection: 60/18/73/.254/.331/.420/0

503) Matt Vierling - DET, 3B/OF, 28.6 - Vierling seems to have a near everyday job in Detroit, but he's a low end option, and his hold on that full time job is very precarious long term, and probably short term too. H has a career 100 wRC+ in 429 games which is dead average, and he has a career .318 xwOBA, which is also almost dead average. His 21.3/7.2 K%/BB% is about average, and his 16 homers with 6 steals is about average (maybe being generous there). But you get the point, he's very MLB average, which is very fantasy below average. He hits the ball hard with a 89.8 MPH EV and he's very fast with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint, but he has a long enough track record, even going back to the minors, to not expect a big homer/steal breakout. 2025 Projection: 72/15/61/.262/.321/.402/8

504) Miguel Vargas - CHW, 3B/OF, 25.4 - Vargas' dynasty owners finally got what they wished for when Vargas got traded to Chicago, opening up playing time, but they say be careful what you wish for, because he was atrocious. He put up a 16 wRC+ in 42 games. He hit .104 with .170 SLG. That has got to be close to all time bad in 42 games. His underlying numbers are admittedly still interesting enough with a 21.6% whiff%, 21.8% Chase%, 28.6 ft/sec sprint, and 21.3 degree launch, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough (86.2 MPH EV), and he swings a slow bat (69.8 MPH). He's also not going to contribute much in Runs or RBI even if he does put together a decent season. He's fine as a bottom of the roster type, or as a depth piece in a deeper league, but I'm no longer really eyeing him as an interesting flier type. - 2025 Projection: 46/10/39/.219/.299/.368/7

505) Luke Raley - SEA, 1B/OF, 30.6 - Raley is a strong side of a platoon bat who just put up his 2nd straight season of a 119 wRC+. He has a very fantasy friendly power/speed combo with a 90.1/95.1 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.5 degree launch, and 28.9 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in 22 homers and 11 steals in 455 PA. The problem is that the plate approach is awful (29.7/5.9 K%/BB%), the 116 combined Runs and RBI is lacking, and he just doesn't get enough playing time to be a coveted fantasy player. In weekly lineup leagues, he's tough to use ever. In daily lineup leagues at least you can play the matchups, and he could be more than useful there. 2025 Projection: 58/20/61/.240/.315/.448/12

506) Ryan O’Hearn - BAL, 1B/OF, 31.8 - O'Hearn is a strong side of a platoon bat who doesn't hit quite enough homers, or hit for quite a high enough average to overcome the cap on plate attempts. He hit .264 with 15 homers in 494 PA. He's a really good hitter with a .351 xwOBA, and the plate skills took a big step forward in 2024 with a career best 14.0/9.3 K%/BB%, so there is certainly value here in daily leagues, but you also have to take into account the massive playing time pressure with Mayo, Basallo, and Kjerstad all ready to break in. He's a nice fantasy bench bat in medium to deeper leagues. 2025 Projection: 52/15/56/.270/.327/.439/3

507) Trevor Larnach - MIN, OF, 28.1 - Larnach is a basically a power only strong side of a platoon bat, and he just hasn't shown enough game power over his career (19 homers in 162 game career average) to get too excited for him. It seems he should hit more homers with a 90.9 MPH EV and 13.6 degree career launch, but he just hasn't. The good news is that he massively improved his hit tool and contact rates. It honestly might be the biggest one year improvement I've ever seen. He went from a 36.5% whiff% and 34% K% in 2023 to a 27.9% whiff% and 22.3% K% in 2024. The improved hit tool definitely levels him up, but it's still a pretty low upside platoon bat. - 2025 Projection: 64/19/64/.247/.330/.430/3

508) Max Kepler - PHI, OF, 32.2 - Kepler's career has been an absolutely wild ride of ups, downs, and mismatched underlying/surface numbers, but at 32 years old, coming off a season where he put up a 95 wRC+ in 105 games that ended with knee tendinitis, his evaluation gets a lot easier. He's a super low end win now piece for medium to deeper leagues. He very well might have a full time job after Philly paid him $10 million, and the 20.1% K%, 88.9 MPH EV, and 16.8 degree launch should still be good enough to pop some dingers. - 2025 Projection: 68/20/66/.248/.318/.427/1

509) Andrew Benintendi - CHW, OF, 30.9 - Benintendi hit 20 homers for the first time since his rookie year that seemed to be a launching point for a near elite dynasty asset career, but we all know that it didn't play out like that. Those 20 homers in his rookie year came with 20 steals, 84 Runs, 90 RBI and a .271 BA. In 2024, it came with 3 steals, 50 Runs, 64 RBI, and a .229 BA. And with a 68 MPH swing, those 20 homers seem like a best case scenario. The White Sox lineup also isn't getting better anytime soon, so you can basically count on Benintendi for nothing. Super low end win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 64/15/64/.253/.315/.396/6

510) Daulton Varsho - TOR, OF, 28.9 - Varsho underwent rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder in mid September which is expected to delay the start of his season. Shoulder surgery that takes you right into the season is not a great starting point, and Varsho's star has already been dimming pretty hardcore over the last two years. He just isn't a good hitter with a career .293 xwOBA in 577 games. The K rate is high (26.7%), the EV is low (86.1 MPH), and while the launch/speed profile makes him fantasy friendly, it's just not good enough to overcome that he isn't a good hitter. Even if his plus outfield defense gets on the field, the upside isn't that high anymore, and I'm not sure how much longer his defense is going to actually give him a full time job. Especially now coming off the shoulder surgery. - 2025 Projection: 58/16/52/.225/.297/.414/10

511) MJ Melendez - KCR, OF, 26.4 - There might come a day where the surface stats actually catch up to the underlying numbers, but after three straight years of underperforming the underlying numbers (.305 career wOBA vs. .325 career xwOBA), I just can't keep on banging my head against the wall and expecting a different outcome. Even the underlying numbers took a step back in 2024 with a career low 8.4% Barrel%, and KC's bad hitter's park isn't doing him any favors either. I still see the 91.1/95.3 MPH AVG/FB EV, 14.6 degree launch, and 25.1% K%, and say how is this guy not hitting 25+ dingers per year. He's never even hit 20 homers, which is wild. He hits lefties worse than righties and he's a bad defensive player, which makes him a low end platoon bat, although KC has such a dearth of options in the OF, he could play everyday regardless (which isn't necessarily a positive thing for us in fantasy either). 2025 Projection: 60/20/66/.230/.313/.424/5

512) Jordan Beck - COL, OF, 23.11 - The thing that makes me most worried about Beck right now is his very, very slightly below average 71.4 MPH swing. And it's on the long side at 7.7 feet. The reason I'm hyper focused on that is because he also has major strikeout issues with a 35.3/6.5 K%/BB% in his 55 game MLB debut, which led to a cover your eyes 32 wRC+. I can handle big strikeout issues in your debut if the bat was electric, but the cold hard stats say the bat actually isn't electric. Speaking of electricity though, he is most certainly an electric athlete at 6'2'', 225 pound with plus speed (28.6 ft/sec sprint) and plus raw power (90.2 MPH EV with 8 homers in 39 games at Triple-A). The RF job is wide open for him in the short term, and with a good spring, I think the Rockies want him to win it. Tack on Coors Field which should theoretically help his biggest weakness (hit tool), and you still have an enticing player here. I just think that risk is creeping up more and more on him, and while there is opportunity right now, Colorado has a lot of good OF options right behind him. - 2025 Projection: 43/12/45/.233/.305/.418/12

513) Luis Ortiz - CLE, RHP, 26.2 - It seems like Ortiz is a favorite for a rotation spot, and getting acquired by a good pitching organization like Cleveland helps his value, but I'm still not huge on Ortiz. The 3.32 ERA in 135.2 IP looked good, but the 19.2/7.6 K%/BB%, 21% whiff%, and lack of any true standout pitches makes me hesitant to buy. He has really good stuff with a 95.9 MPH 4-seamer, and the slider put up a decent 31% whiff%, so the ingredients are definitely in here to breakout if Cleveland can figure it out. And he did pitch well last year, so maybe I'm being too harsh. He's not really one of my guys, but I see the appeal. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.13/1.30/117 in 140 IP

514) Jordan Hicks - SFG, RHP, 28.8 - It seems like SF is sticking with Hicks as a starter, and it seems he has the inside track on the 5th starter job right now. The transition was far from a resounding success, but it went decently with a 4.10 ERA and 20/9.8 K%/BB% in 109.2 IP. They removed him from the rotation by late July and he suffered shoulder inflammation at the end of the season as well. I'm happy to say that he was never a target for me despite getting a lot of off-season love. The fastball velocity dropped like a stone from 100.1 MPH to 94.5 MPH, and the control remained below average. The one silver lining is that his sweeper and splitter were absolute whiff machines. The heavily used sinker keeps the ball on the ground. There are still ingredients here to like, which is why it seems SF is sticking with him, but he's only a low cost option, and there is no guarantee he sticks as a starter. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.03/1.38/105 in 120 IP

515) Hayden Wesneski - HOU, RHP, 27.4 - It seems like Wesneski is the favorite for the 5th starter job to start the season, and I don't think Houston would have traded for him if they didn't like him. And there were some things to like in 2024 with a 3.86 ERA and 23.7/7.4 K%/BB% in 67.2 IP. His sweeper is his most used pitch and it's dominant with a 43.3% whiff%. His 94.6 MPH 4-seamer and 93.5 MPH sinker both keep the ball on the ground, and his cutter was pretty good last year too with a .240 xwOBA. It's a relievery profile, but he's been a starter for most of his career, and he definitely has some tools to make it work in the rotation. Let's also see what Houston can help him with to maybe get over that hump. I don't mind him as a flier. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.16/1.26/125 in 130 IP

516) Landon Knack - LAD, RHP, 27.9 - Knack had a damn good MLB debut with a 3.65 ERA and 24.1/6.3 K%/BB% in 69 IP, but of course, in true Dodgers fashion, he seems eons away from a rotation spot. To the Dodgers credit, that seems like the high end of his ability. The 23.1% whiff% is below average and none of his pitches really stood out. The 93.5 MPH fastball was his best pitch with a respectable 20.3% whiff%, but none of the secondaries were able to do better than a 27.8% whiff%. He's more control over command and the stuff gets hit hard too with a 10.2% Barrel%. He's a good depth starter, but he's not good enough to push the Dodgers hand to be anything more than that. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.95/1.27/87 in 90 IP

517) Gavin Stone - LAD, RHP, 26.6 - Stone underwent shoulder surgery in October and will miss all over 2025. We also know the odds of him just walking right back into a rotation spot in 2026 is highly unlikely in LA. So this injury really does kill his dynasty value. It's a shame, because he was bouncing back from a down 2023 and living up to his lofty prospect promise before going down with the injury with a 3.53 ERA and 20.0/6.4 K%/BB% in 140.1 IP. The strikeouts were the only thing missing, but the changeup and slider missed plenty of bats, so even that wasn't that big of a concern. I would have really liked Stone without the injury, but a shoulder injury is scary for pitchers, and his path to get back into the rotation isn't going to be easy either. - 2025 Projection: OUT

518) Christian Scott - NYM, RHP, 25.9 - Scott underwent a hybrid Tommy John surgery and internal brace procedure in late September which will knock him out for all of 2025. I don't know if it's worse that he needed both or if this kind of elbow surgery is just evolving, but I'm going to assume it's the latter ... or is it the former? ... no, it's the latter ... am I the only one who takes way too long to figure out which is the former and which is the latter? Either way, Scott straddles the line between the type of pitcher I like taking the Tommy John discount on and ones I don't. He wasn't quite an elite pitching prospect, but he wasn't far off from it, and he didn't fully established himself on the MLB level yet, but he was starting to set a pretty strong foundation. He put up a 4.56 ERA with a 19.8/6.1 K%/BB% in 47.1 IP in his MLB debut. Plus control of a highly used, above average 94.2 MPH fastball is his bread and butter. He combines that with a potentially plus sweeper, above average splitter, and decent slider. None of the secondaries missed enough bats in the majors to keep up the 33.5% K% he put up at Triple-A, and the fastball isn't quite a good enough pitch to make up for it. He can be a plus control mid-rotation starter even if the secondaries don't miss a ton of bats, but he'll have to unlock more if he wants to beat that projection. And now also tack on risk from the elbow surgery. Don't forget about him, but I'm not sure I'm going out of my way to get him either. - 2025 Projection: OUT Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.22/150 in 150 IP

519) Emmet Sheehan - LAD, RHP, 25.4 - Sheehan underwent Tommy John surgery in mid May which will keep him out until mid-season 2025 at the very best, and more likely will limit him to more of a late season option. The Dodgers rotation is quite frankly a headache to figure out where everyone fits in not just for 2025, but long term as well. It's the type of headache where I don't really love dealing with it for fantasy. The "problem" though, is that the guys who do emerge for them, are generally very, very good, so you can't just write the situation off completely. At his best, Sheehan was a legit near elite pitching prospect, so his upside is high enough to keep on the radar. Here was my writeup for him last off-season before all the elbow problems started: "Sheehan didn’t have a standout MLB debut with a 4.92 ERA and a 25.8%/10.5% K%/BB% in 60.1 IP, but some of the underlying data is extremely encouraging. Most notably, his 3 secondary pitches were absolutely devastating. The slider put up a .179 xwOBA with a 43.8% whiff%, the changeup put up a .200 xwOBA with a 47.6% whiff%, and the very lightly used sweeper put up a .161 xwOBA with a 41.2% whiff%. His heavily used 95.4 MPH fastball was solid as well with a respectable 20.2% whiff%. His 3.50 xERA looks much better than the surface stats, and he also closed the year out in dominant fashion with a 1.98 ERA and 24/4 K/BB in 13.2 IP over 3 outings. His control is below average, but it’s never really been in the major danger zone, so I wouldn’t downgrade him too much because of that." .... don't give up on him, but I can't in good conscience call him target with so much path to a rotation spot uncertainty. - 2025 Projection: OUT

520) Luis Matos - SFG, OF, 23.5 - The ballpark absolutely destroys Matos. In the right park, Matos could be an impact player, but in SF, a lift and pull approach with mediocre EV's is just a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what happened in 2024 with a 60 wRC+ in 45 games. In another park, plus contact (15.4% K%) with a 51.2% Pull% and 44.9% FB% could thrive, but with a 87.6 MPH EV at Triple-A (and 86.9 MPH in the majors), that ballpark is just going to eat him up. To be fair, Matos actually hit well at home and horrible on the road, but I still don't really think that changes my narrative at all. I'm looking towards the future, and I don't see it working there. He also doesn't run quite enough with 0 steals in the majors and 8 steals in 81 games in the minors. And while the contact rates are double plus to elite, the approach is terrible with a 40.1% Chase%. I'm not loving the upside in his current environment even if he can win a full time job in the next few years, which I think he can. - 2025 Projection: 31/9/36/.238/.302/.396/5 Prime Projection: 74/18/73/.251/.318/.420/12

521) Sal Stewart - CIN, 2B/3B, 21.4 - If you like a plus plate approach, Stewart is your man. He put up a 16.9/14.8 K%/BB% in 80 games at High-A which led to a 144 wRC+. It's basically the same thing he did in 2023 and 2022. But he's not just a plus plate approach, he also has very real raw power. Just watch him crush this dinger 454 feet out to centerfield. This is a big physical guy in the box who can certainly unleash more game power if he tries. He hit only 8 homers this year and he likes to spray liners all over the field, so he would definitely have to change his hitting approach to do it, which may or may not work. He might just be content to plate approach his way through the minors. I don't love betting on plate approach guys who don't have much speed and aren't particularly good defensive players, but if he does unlock more game power, he could end up having a very potent hit/power combo at peak. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/21/76/.274/.350/.452/9

522) Tai Peete - SEA, SS/OF/3B, 19.7 - Tai Peete is the same age as many of the high schoolers in the 2024 Draft (he's 1 month younger than Bryce Rainer), and his pure talent can rival any of them (maybe not Konnor Griffin's, but everyone else's). He also already has a pretty strong season at Single-A under his belt with a .269/.343/.408 triple-slash in 115 games. That is a pretty good slash for an 18 year old in full season ball. He hit only 7 homers, but all 7 of them came in his final 59 games, which is the improvement you want to see from a young player as the season goes along. And he has no joke raw power at 6'2'', 193 pounds, so there is a lot more of that coming. He's a really good athlete and he displayed elite base stealing ability with 45 steals in 50 attempts. What I'm trying to say, is that Peete is getting mighty underrated right now. I understand why he's getting rated so low, because the hit tool is a legit problem with a 30.7% K%, but he walked 10.4% of the time too, and you have to take into account his young age for the level. There is definitely still a lot of rawness to his game, but he performed pretty well despite that rawness, so imagine what he can do as he starts to refine his game. I aim for upside in fantasy, and Peete is all upside. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/75/.247/.323/.432/26

523) Staryln Caba - MIA, SS, 19.4 - Caba is a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect with an elite glove at SS and little to no raw or game power, but that doesn't mean he isn't enticing at all for fantasy. His plate skills are elite with both plus contact rates and a plus approach. He put up a 14.4/19.7 K%/BB% in 78 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A. He's also a plus runner who loves to steal with 50 steals in 62 attempts. If he can make enough impact to the baseball, he could be a potent top of the order hitter with BA, OBP and tons of steals. But how much impact he will make is the question. He's not a big guy at 5'10'', he doesn't hit the ball hard with a 83.7 MPH EV at Single-A, and his ground ball rate was around 50%. He's young and has time to get bigger and add power, but just how much he can get to is the question. Guys like Caba generally top out at around Top 75-ish fantasy prospects for me when they are knocking on the door of the bigs, and since Caba isn't knocking on the door of the bigs, he's more of a Top 150-ish prospect. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/12/51/.284/.353/.395/34

524) Angel Genoa - CLE, SS, 20.10 - Genoa will rank higher on real life lists because he has a good glove at SS and a solid all around offensive game, but he's not nearly as exciting for fantasy. The reason I even have him ranked this high is because getting ranked highly on real life lists boosts fantasy trade value, whether rightly or wrongly, and having a good glove also gets you on the field. Opportunity and leash is a big factor for success, and Genoa's glove should give him that. And it's not like he's a zero on offense at all. He slashed .330/.379/.499 with 10 homers, 25 steals, and a 15.5/7.7 K%/BB% in 110 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's a 6 foot switch hitter who should get to average power at peak, and while he's not a burner, he should contribute in steals as well. He's a solid but unspectacular across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/17/74/.268/.323/.428/17

525) Roderick Arias - NYY, SS/2B, 20.7 - Arias was one of the top bets to go full elite prospect status in 2024, and it's good reminder that even though it can feel like a rookie ball prospect is inevitable, they aren't actually inevitable. There is a lot of inherent risk if you haven't even hit full season ball yet. Arias struggled to adjust for the first 3+ months of the season with a .652 OPS and 34.9% K%, but he finally found his groove in the final 2 months, giving hope that the big prospect breakout can still happen in 2025. In his final 47 games he slashed .276/.390/.471 with 7 homers, 16 steals, and a 24.4/14.6 K%/BB%. The strikeout rate has been high throughout his career, so there is definitely hit tool risk here, but he hits the ball hard, he has speed and he gets on base. I don't think it's fair to expect a truly elite prospect breakout anymore. You are really aiming for those rocket ships with little to no bumps in the road, and that isn't quite Arias. But just because his stock took a hit, doesn't mean he's not a really talented prospect. Just more of a Top 100-150 one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/77/.247/.326/.442/23

526) Joswa Lugo - LAA, SS, 18.2 - Lugo signed for $2.3 million in last year's international class with the big tools to back it up at 6'3'', and then he went out and impressed in the DSL, slashing .301/.370/.466 with 5 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.3/7.8 K%/BB% in 53 games. He has power potential written all over him with a smooth and quick righty swing that already packs a major punch. He had no groundball issues with a 35.3% GB%, so he should be able to get to all of his power at peak. He's also a really good athlete who is currently at SS, so while he's likely to fill out and slow down over time, he should be at least be a contributor in stolen bases, along with a possible asset with the glove (or at least not a total nothing). The biggest red flag is that the K/BB rates were pretty weak against DSL competition, so there is still a ton of risk present here, but if he performs well when he comes stateside, he has the type of talent that can explode in a hurry. He's one of my favorite DSL breakouts. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/26/86/.251/.321/.471/12

527) Kellon Lindsey - LAD, SS, 19.6 - Selected 23rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, elite speed is the the 6'0'', 175 pound Lindsey's calling card, and it comes with a good glove at SS and a good feel to hit. There isn't big power in here, and while that should tick up over time, he doesn't really project for big power down the line either. The hit tool is solid, but it's not really in that near elite range and there is some risk with how it will perform against more advanced pitching. He's an excellent athlete who played QB and DB in high school, so there is plenty of upside in here, but going after a speed first guy without huge power and with a good but not great hit tool I think warrants some caution. I know getting drafted by LA and getting Trea Turner comps is exciting, but I'm not sure I'm reaching for Lindsey quite yet. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/15/66/.270/.328/.420/31

528) Josuar Gonzalez - SFG, SS, 17.6 - Gonzalez is expected to sign for one of the top bonuses in the class, and he earned that bonus by being a great athlete and doing everything well on the baseball field. He's not a huge guy at 5'10'', 170 pounds, so he's more in the mold of a Jesus Made than a Emil Morales to use two comps from last years class. Of course, that is if everything goes right. If everything doesn't go right, he's more in the mold of a Fernando Cruz or Brando Mayea. He's a switch hitter who looks super smooth, explosive and locked in at the dish. He has a good feel to hit, approach, he can hit it hard, he's fast, and he has a good glove. He's not one of those overtly physical prospects that I really love sticking my neck out for, so I'm not going to fly him up my rankings, but he's definitely exciting. I've been going back and forth in my mind if I prefer the 2nd tier of high school bats from the MLB draft class, or the top tier of international bats, and right now I'm leaning draft bats. But it's close. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 88/18/62/.277/.342/.421/28

529) Luis Baez - HOU, OF, 21.2 - Please just watch how fast this home run left Baez' bat. Is that even real? That looked like a cartoon or something. And while you're at it, also check out how athletic that swing was. For such a powerful man, that is a damn athletic swing. It's no surprise he demolished 20 homers in 92 games at High-A (and he also stole 9 bags, showing off that athleticism I was talking about). His power is no joke, and he lifts and pulls it. The problem is that the hit tool and plate approach are both double below average with a 27.3/5.4 K%/BB%. He got a cup of coffee at Double-A to end the season, and it was nice to see the 18.0/13.1 K%/BB% in 14 games, but it came with only 1 homer and a 84 wRC+. He can play some OF, so he's not a defensive liability, but he's not likely to add much value with the glove. The bat is going to have to hit it's ceiling, and he still has to prove it in the upper minors, but it's so easy to fall in love with that swing and power. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 72/27/84/.245/.316/.463/5

530) Brailer Guerrero - TBR, OF, 18.9 - Guerrero suffered a torn labrum which required surgery in 2023, limiting him to just 7 games in the DSL, and then that surgically repaired shoulder once again gave him problems in 2024, ending his season in late July after 28 games at stateside rookie ball. But he showed enough in those 28 games to take on the added injury risk. He's a big and physical 6'1'', 215 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that smokes the ball. He slashed .330/.452/.466 with 2 homers, 13 steals, and a 25.4/17.5 K%/BB%. He's not a burner, but he's a good athlete, and he signed for $3.7 million in 2023, which tells you the type of talent he has. He hit the ball on the ground too much (50%), he struck out too much, and there is injury risk, but there is also big upside in here. The shoulder injuries are really just creating a larger buy window here than there should be. And he'll still be just 18 years old for half of 2025, so there is plenty of time for development. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/26/87/.257/.326/.469/9

531) Yilber Diaz - ARI, RHP, 24.7 - Diaz is too far down the pecking order in Arizona to get too pumped for him, but path to playing time aside, there is plenty to like here. He put up a 3.80 ERA with a 32.1/10.8 K%/BB% in 104.1 IP in the upper minors. He then got a shot in the majors, and while the 16% K% in 28.1 IP isn't impressive, his slider (36.5% whiff%) and curve (35.3% whiff%) were both whiff machines, so he clearly has more in the tank. He also throws gas with a 96.1 MPH fastball, although it wasn't a very good pitch in the majors. He threw the fastball more than 50% of the time, and combined with the below average control and lack of rotation spot, there are enough seasons to doubt him to not get too carried away here. But velocity, swing and miss secondaries, and upper minors production is a strong trifecta, so if he works his way into a rotation spot, I'd be happy to roster him to see how it plays out. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/66 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.31/151 in 150 IP

532) Noble Meyer - MIA, RHP, 20.3 - There is no two ways about it, Meyer had a really rough first full year of pro ball with a 5.18 ERA and 23.5/17.9 K%/BB% in 40 IP at HIgh-A. He was better at Single-A, but it still came with a 16.3% BB% in 34 IP. That is just an insanely high walk rate over 74 IP, and it's really hard to overlook as much as I want to overlook it. Maybe if it came with mid to upper 90's heat, it would be easier, but the fastball sat more low to mid 90's this year. The reason I want to overlook the poor numbers, is because Meyer still looks like that electric, hyped pitching prospect when you watch him. He's a projectable and athletic 6'5'' who most certainly looks the part. And while the fastball velocity wasn't off the charts, it explodes out of his hand and is a bat missing weapon. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus to double plus slider and a lesser used, but good changeup. The ingredients and eye test are definitely here to still be a top of the rotation starter, but he clearly has a ways to go with his control/command to get there. I can definitely see scenarios where I would prefer him over Agustin Ramirez and De Los Santos, so placing him 2nd on this list wouldn't be unreasonable at all. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.87/1.31/180 in 170 IP

533) Thomas Harrington - PIT, RHP, 23.9 - Harrington is a floor over upside prospect with plus command of a diverse pitch mix. He has a heavily used low to mid 90's fastball that is probably about an average pitch at best when you factor in his command over it. He combines that with a plus changeup, an average-ish sweeper, an average-ish cutter, and a lesser used curve which is a good pitch when he goes to it. None of his pitches really missed enough bats at Triple-A to get really overly excited, but they generally induced weak contact, and a 22.5% whiff% on the fastball, 30.0% whiff% on the changeup, and 33.3% whiff% on the lesser used curve isn't that bad. It all led to a 2.61 ERA with a 25.1/4.1 K%/BB% in 117.1 IP in the upper minors. I see more of a low WHIP, mediocre K #3/4 starter on the MLB level, which isn't bad, but it's also not exactly the upside I love aiming for. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.30/1.32/72 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.86/1.23/144 in 160 IP

534) George Lombard - NYY, SS, 19.10 - Lombard's hit tool was not as good as hoped in his first full year of pro ball with a 24% K% and .232 BA in 81 games at Single-A, and then a 19.8% K% and .226 BA in 29 games at High-A. A large chunk of his value was coming from that hit tool, because he doesn't have big present power with only 5 homers in 110 games. The launch and approach are geared more for line drives than homers, so it's not just about gaining more power naturally, which he will. He has good tools at 6'3'', 190 pounds and there is definitely room to tack on more mass. He's also fast and a good baserunner with 39 steals. He has a mature approach (12.3% BB% with a .338 OBP), he's a good defensive SS, and he's young for his class at a still 19 years old as of 2025 Opening Day. There is potential for him to be an above average across the board player at peak, but he's going to have to show real hit tool gains pretty soon, or a major power increase if he doesn't want the profile to start looking a bit lackluster. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/17/69/.259/.324/.419/23

535) Giancarlo Stanton - NYY, OF, 35.4 - Stanton is the Bat Speed King, absolutely lapping the field with a 81.3 MPH swing. Oneil Cruz is 2nd at 78.6 MPH. On the flip side, it's also the longest swing in baseball with a very worst 8.6 degree length (Javier Baez is tied for last with him). And both of those were with a 1 swing qualification, so there is no sample size funny business going on there. The dude swings hard (the hardest), and he swings long (the longest). And while we didn't need anymore evidence to know exactly who Giancarlo Stanton was (a low BA slugger, or should I say, THE low BA slugger), we now have that clear evidence. He also gets hurt all the time and likely won't play in much more than 120 games at best. You know what you are getting. He's a fairly priced win now piece. 2025 Projection: 61/29/81/.230/.304/.470/0 but possibly out for the season Update: Both elbows are seriously injured and it seems season ending elbow surgery is on the table

536) George Klassen - LAA, RHP, 23.2 - The 22 year old Klassen got a little bit worse at every level as he climbed the minor league ladder. He put up a 0.71 ERA with a 39.6/8.3 K%/BB% in 38 IP at Single-A. A 4.22 ERA with a 35.2/9.9 K%/BB% in 21.1 IP at High-A. And then a 5.65 ERA with a 28.3/17.3 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP at Double-A. Age for level isn't as important for pitcher as it is for hitters, but I think Klassen is a good example for why it still needs to be taken into account. An older, more advanced pitcher can definitely have real advantages over less experienced hitters, which will make them look better than they really are. But the reason it doesn't matter as much for pitchers, is that stuff don't lie, and Klassen got that stuff. He throws a plus mid to upper 90's fastball, which he combines with a plus curve and a potentially plus hard slider/cutter. The control/command is below average, and it's not great how quickly he fell apart in his first taste of the upper minors, but it's hard not to fall in love with that stuff. He's a great proximity upside play with a soft landing spot as a high leverage reliever. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.33/1.36/61 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.79/1.28/182 in 165 IP

537) Winston Santos - TEX, RHP, 23.0 - Santos might be one of the more underrated pitching prospects in the minors right now, and he fits squarely into that pitching prospect bucket that I love to shop in. He has big stuff with a plus to double plus mid 90's fastball that misses bats and has a great movement profile. The slider is above average and it plays up because of his good control/command over it. And while he doesn't go to the changeup that often, it flashes as a really good pitch. It all led to a 3.67 ERA with a 30.1/7.4 K%/BB% in 110.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. The ERA spiked to 4.89 at Double-A, but the 3.63 xFIP and 29.5/7.3 K%/BB% shows he got unlucky. As is, he can be a solid #3/4 starter with good K rates and a good WHIP, but if he can develop his changeup more and/or take his control up to double plus levels, he can beat that projection. I like him a ton relative to perceived value. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.81/1.22/175 in 168 IP

538) Jonah Tong - NYM, RHP, 21.9 - Here is what I wrote about Tong in the in-season Dynasty Baseball Rundowns after his first start at Double-A on September 5th, "Tong got the call to Double-A, and if there were any questions about how his stuff would translate against upper minors hitters, there aren't questions anymore after he went 6 IP with 0 hits, 0 ER, and a 9/0 K/BB. Talk about making a statement. The low to mid 90's fastball will play just fine. Here he is blowing a fastball by Spencer Jones. Granted, I think I could strikeout Spencer Jones right now, but still. It wasn't just Jones, it was everyone. Showing that level of dominance in the upper minors was a big hurdle to clear." ... He wasn't as good in his 2nd start at the level (and final start of the season) with 3 ER and a 5/4 K/BB in 3.1 IP, but we already knew that below average control is a weakness in his game. Seeing the stuff so clearly fully translate was exciting. The breaking ball is absolutely filthy, the bat missing fastball can be a plus pitch despite the mediocre velocity, and he rounds out the arsenal with a cutter and changeup. If he can improve him control/command, Tong could be a beast, and even if he can't, he can be a high K, mid rotation starter. I'm definitely in on him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 11/3.71/1.27/174 in 155 IP

539) Edwin Arroyo - CIN, SS, 21.7 - Arroyo underwent shoulder surgery in late March and missed all of 2024, but he made it back for the AFL, so he should be able to have a completely normal off-season and be 100% healthy for 2025. Granted, he didn't hit very well in the AFL with a .642 OPS in 18 games, but he's 2.2 years younger than average, and this is basically his spring training coming off a major surgery. I would only take it as a positive that he is even playing in the league. He’s a switch hitter who hits well from both sides of the plate, he has plus speed, and at a pretty skinny 5'11”, there is definitely room for him to add more power. The hit tool and approach aren't quite good enough to get really excited for this type of profile, but if he can add real power, there is definitely potential for him to put up some super impactful fantasy seasons hitting in Cincinnati. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/17/64/.253/.320/.426/25

540) Cade Cavalli - WAS, RHP, 26.7 - Cavalli underwent Tommy John surgery in March 2023, and he never made it back on an MLB mound in 2024 at all. He barely made it back on a minor league mound with 8.1 IP at High-A and rookie ball after getting shutdown with a "dead arm." It's just a reminder that coming back from Tommy John surgery is not always smooth, and while it's not a death knell by any means, it's not always a cake walk right back into prime form. Here is how I finished his blurb in last year's Top 1,000, and honestly, it's still exactly how I feel now: "When healthy, the 6’4”, 240 pound Cavalli does have plenty to be excited about with big time stuff (95+ MPH fastball) and three quality secondaries in his curve, changeup and slider. The control is inconsistent and his minor league career was a bit up and down, so combined with the Tommy John risk, he’s not someone I’m really targeting." The one thing he does have going for him is that there is plenty of opportunity in Washington's rotation, so the leash should be very long for him to shake the rust off. - 2025 Projection: 4/4.38/1.37/94 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.03/1.32/162 in 159 IP

541) Logan Henderson - MIL, RHP, 23.1 - It's a little worrisome that Henderson's production took a big step back when he got to Triple-A, because the stuff isn't really that huge, but he still wasn't too bad with a 4.56 ERA and 26.5/6.1 K%/BB% in 23.2 IP. He was lights out at Double-A with a 3.30 ERA and 32.6/3.9 K%/BB% in 46.1 IP. The fastball only sits 92.5 MPH but it gets good movement and is a bat missing weapon. The nasty changeup is his best secondary and a heavily used pitch that both misses bats and induces weak contact. He rounds out the arsenal with a mediocre cutter. Plus control with an excellent secondary and a bat missing, low 90's fastball can definitely work, but lack of a good breaking ball is a problem. Maybe he's just a back end starter, but I think there is some mid rotation upside in here, and if he can develop a legitimate breaking ball (he's still only 22 as of this writing), I don't think it's out of the question for him to end up a legit impact fantasy starter. You also have to trust Milwaukee with a guy like this. Henderson is definitely a nice proximity arm to target even in shallower leagues. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.30/63 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.85/1.23/155 in 155 IP

542) Caleb Durbin - MIL, 2B/3B, 25.1 - I see the huge offensive season Durbin just had at Triple-A, slashing .287/.396/.471 with 10 homers, 29 steals, and a 9.9/12.5 K%/BB% in 82 games (he was even better in the AFL with a .976 OPS in 24 games), but I'm struggling to get past the extremely low 83 MPH EV. He's only 5'6'', he's already 25 years old (as of 2025 Opening Day), and while he has a solid infield glove, he's not some slick fielding SS whose glove will get him on the field. It seems like a utility infielder profile to me, and while the trade to Milwaukee helps his value, I'm not sure he's more than a utility infielder on their team either. On the other hand, his contact/speed combo gives him a very clear path to fantasy usefulness if he does work his way into the lineup. He can also lift and pull it, which we know can overcome a low EV, but an 83 MPH EV isn't just low, it's among the worst in baseball low. I know Durbin has his big supporters, and while I'm not one of them, I understand what they see with contact, speed, lift, pull, and proximity. I don't mind him as a proximity play, but he's not really one of my guys. - 2025 Projection: 49/7/33/.250/.313/.360/17 Prime Projection: 76/10/58/.271/.325/.383/26

543) Chase Meidroth - CHW, 2B/3B/SS, 23.9 - Meidroth was part of the return for Garrett Crochet, and if Chicago didn't think he has a very good chance of being a starting caliber player, why would they even want him included. It sure feels like he's the favorite for the starting 2B job right out of the gate, which is a big boost to his value. Unfortunately, that big boost still doesn't boost him very high in my book. The power is lacking with only 7 homers, a 5 degree launch, and a 2.2% Barrel% in 122 games at Triple-A, and so is the speed with 13 steals in 19 attempts. An elite plate approach is his game with a 12.7/18.8 K%/BB%, which led to a .293 BA, .437 OBP, and a 132 wRC+. His 88.6 MPH EV also isn't bad, so while it hasn't led to homers, it could be good enough to maintain the high BA/OBP on the MLB level. If he were potentially hitting atop a really good lineup, I could see real fantasy value here, but in the White Sox lineup, the fantasy value is likely to be lacking for the next few seasons. I can see a path to a solid fantasy player, but it's not a journey I'm looking to go on. - 2025 Projection: 63/11/49/.255/.320/.386/7 Prime Projection: 84/15/61/.276/.352/.416/9

544) Matthew Lugo - LAA, OF, 23.10 - Lugo had a monstrous breakout at Double-A this season, slashing .315/.405/.664 with 11 homers, 9 steals, and a 21.1/11.7 K%/BB% in 43 games. It's also not the first time he's had a huge season. He had a big time year in 2022 as well. His numbers dropped off at Triple-A, but he still performed well with a 107 wRC+, 5 homers, 7 steals, and a 27.0/8.5 K%/BB% in 35 games. His raw power is currently below average with a 86.5 MPH EV, but there is still some projection on his frame at 6'1'', so that can easily tick up in his mid 20's, and best of all, he's a lift and pull machine, so he'll get the most out of his raw power. He also has good speed and went 16 for 17 on the bases in 79 total games. The hit tool is below average and the talent probably isn't quite big enough to just overlook that, but a lift and pull profile with speed is very fantasy friendly, and he's knocking on the door of the bigs. I'm starting to like Lugo a decent amount in medium to deeper leagues as proximity play. 2025 Projection: 21/5/28/.229/.290/390/3 Prime Projection: 76/19/74/.246/.313/.420/11

545) Gavin Cross - KC, OF, 24.2 - Cross bounced back in 2024 from a disappointing first full year of pro ball, slashing .261/.342/.428 with 15 homers, 30 steals, and a 24.1/10.3 K%/BB% in 101 games at Double-A. It was good for a 115 wRC+. It certainly has his value back on the rise, and while this isn't the player many were hoping to see after getting selected 9th overall, there is still an intriguing power/speed combo in here for fantasy. He doesn't smash the ball, but the raw power is solid, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's not a burner, but he has speed, and he's been an excellent base stealer throughout his career, going 30 for 32 this year. The two biggest issues are that the hit tool is below average, and KC is absolutely death (dead last) for lefty homers. It seems like a recipe for a low BA and limited homers. If Cross played in a different park, I might be enticed by the profile, but in KC, I'm a little worried it's going to be lackluster. 2025 Projection: 19/5/24/.221/.298/.391/7 Prime Projection: 74/18/76/.242/.318/.421/18

546) Masataka Yoshida - BOS, OF, 31.8 - Yoshida is a super boring fantasy player at his best with a BA first profile, moderate power, and little speed. And at his worst he is a low upside platoon bat, which is almost unrosterable except in very deep leagues. He's terrible vs lefties (.565 OPS), he's terrible on defense, and Boston is about to be stacked, so I'm leaning that he's a strict platoon bat. I'm out on Yoshida for the vast majority of leagues. - 2025 Projection: 66/14/66/.282/.340/.420/4

547) Jake Cronenworth - SDP, 2B/1B, 31.2 - Cronenworth bounced back from a down 2023, but it's still not a fantasy friendly profile at all. He hit .241 with 17 homers and 5 steals in 155 games. He has plus plate skills and he can lift it, but he doesn't hit it hard enough in the air to fully take advantage of it. It's average to below average across the board, which is fine, but nothing to be excited about. - 2025 Projection: 74/16/74/.238/.320/.394/6

548) Jarred Kelenic - ATL, OF, 25.8 - It's sad to say that Kelenic has settled in as a strong side of a platoon bat, and that is at best. When Acuna returns, he could be out of a job completely. He put up an 86 wRC+ in 131 games and he has a career 86 wRC+ in 383 games. You can say he got unlucky last year with a .308 xwOBA vs. .294 wOBA, but he's gotten "unlucky" every year of his career, and that xwOBA is still below average. The hit tool just couldn't hack it. His 29.6% K% was actually a career best, but he needed to drop his BB% to a career low 7.1% to do it. That power (15 homers with a 9.9% Barrel%) and athleticism (7 steals with a 27.9 ft/sec sprint) are still there, but he can't hit lefties (.516 OPS in 72 PA), and hoping for hit tool improvement at this point seems like wishful thinking. He's only 25, so I guess you never know though. 2025 Projection: 46/13/44/.241/.308/.416/8

549) Addison Barger - TOR, 3B/OF, 25.5 - Barger isn't a good defensive player (although he played a good RF last year), which makes it harder for a fringy type like him to get playing time, but out of all of Toronto's fringy players, I want to bet on his bat the most. I've always gushed over his swing, and seeing his near elite 74.3 MPH bat speed just backs up my visual evaluation. That level of bat speed is not to be trifled with, and while he's had some hit tool troubles throughout his career, he's shown improvement there in the upper minors over the last two years. He put up a very respectable 19.3/16.1 K%/BB% in 57 games at Triple-A this year, and he wasn't too bad in the majors either with a 27.6% whiff% and 26.7% K% (albeit with a .239 BABIP fueled .197 BA). As you know from that bat speed, he hits the ball hard with a 90.1 MPH EV at AAA and a 8.7% Barrel% in the majors. The MLB debut was rough with a 70 wRC+ in 69 games, but like I mentioned, some of that was bad luck, and seeing the contact rates not implode is encouraging. He doesn't run a ton, but a 28 ft/sec sprint shows he's a good athlete. He doesn't seem to have a spot right now, but I would hesitate to write him off with that type of bat speed. I'm side eying him. - 2025 Projection: 44/16/53/.238/.314/.428/4

550) Joey Loperfido - TOR, OF, 25.11 - Toronto has a lot of interesting fringy players who are going to Battle Royale it out for playing time. And that battle is sure to go into the season, so predicting who will emerge is quite hard. In most leagues, you probably want to wait to see who emerges, and then try to jump on them quickly, rather than hold any of them, but in deeper leagues, you might not have that luxury. Loperfido is one of those players, and since he has the ability to play CF (he was an above average CF in his 20 games at the position), his glove could give him a leg up on large role in 2025. His MLB debut was rough due to a 36.3/5.0 K%/BB% that led to a 74 wRC+. He's almost 26 years old and he also had a 28% K% at Triple-A. I'm not saying he can't improve there, but expecting major improvement is probably a low probability outcome. What you are buying is the very real power/speed combo. He's 6'3'', 220 pounds with a 90.8 MPH EV at AAA and a 28.8 ft/sec sprint. It led to 13 homers and 9 steals in just 39 games at the level. It dropped off in the majors with an 88.3 MPH EV, leading to only 4 homers and 4 steals in 81 games, but if he can figure out the hit tool, we know the ability is in there to do much better than that. Considering his age and consistent hit tool issues, he profiles more as a 4th OF, but the fantasy friendly skillset is in here if he gets playing time and makes the necessary improvements. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/51/.226/.302/.412/11

551) Henry Davis - PIT, C/OF, 25.6 - Davis was one of my biggest misses in 2024, and while I believe my process was sound and I don't regret calling him a target, it was still a miss. Not only didn't he improve from his rookie year in 2023, everything got worse. He put up a 85.3 MPH EV (88.6 MPH in 2023), a 4.8% Barrel% (7% in 2023), a .224 xwOBA (.291 in 2023), and a 36.9% K% (27.1 in 2023) in 37 games. There was all this buzz about him going to driveline and improving his bat speed, and while he did swing an above average 72.5 MPH bat, it obviously didn't matter. He had an opportunity to lock down Pitt's catcher job and he couldn't do it, letting Joey Bart slide into the job. Endy Rodriguez will also return to compete for at bats behind the plate, leaving Davis in competition with a gaggle of players for outfield and catcher reps. The only silver lining, if you can call it that, is that he obliterated Triple-A with a 148 wRC+ in 57 games. I'm far from giving up on him completely or labeling him a bust, but the bottom line is that he just no longer is someone to target, even on the low end. He's a 25 year old who isn't good on defense and has struggled in the majors. Yea, there is still potential in the bat, but that just isn't a unique profile. A lot of guys fit into that. He's fine to roster, but this isn't a case of where I'm going back to the well. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/33/.223/.298/.402/3

552) Echedry Vargas - MIA, SS, 20.1 - Vargas has been ripping up rookie ball for the last 2 years, and in his first taste of full season ball, he just kept on producing, slashing .276/.321/.454 with 14 homers, 29 steals, and a 21.1/5.0 K%/BB% in 97 games. It was good for a 125 wRC+. As you can see from that low walk rate, he chases a ton, and it gives him plenty of risk as he climbs the minor league ladder. He also isn't the type to jump off the screen with huge size or eye popping athleticism, but he can hit the ball hard, he can lift it, he can pull it, and he has speed. He's done nothing but produce in his career, and he generally has a good feel to hit. It might not end up the highest upside profile, but he has the potential to be an across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 72/19/77/.252/.317/.426/16

553) Braxton Garrett - MIA, LHP, 27.8 - Garrett underwent revision surgery and an internal brace procedure on his elbow in January which will knock him out for all of 2025. He got a late start to 2024 with a shoulder injury, looked mostly like himself for 7 outings, and then went right back on the IL with an elbow injury that turned into the surgery. He's a plus control #3/4 type starter at full health, which isn't exactly the upside I'm looking for on guys to take the "Tommy John" discount on. He's fine to keep on your IL for free, but anything more than free is likely too much for me. - 2025 Projection: OUT

554) Justin Wrobleski - LAD, LHP, 24.9 - It's just super hard to roster Dodgers pitchers. You have no idea when or if they will get a shot, and they will get almost no leash when they do get a shot. It's just too big of a pain in the ass for fantasy, and while I like Wrobleski, his upside isn't quite high enough to wait around and hope he ends up in the rotation. He has a plus mid 90's fastball that misses bats and induces weak contact, both in the upper minors and in the majors. He pairs that with a potentially above average slider as his best out pitch, and he has a diverse pitch mix (he also throws a cutter, curve, sinker, and changeup). It all resulted in a 3.76 ERA with a 25.9/7.7 K%/BB% in 95.2 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. He got knocked around in the majors with a 5.70 ERA and 16.9/10.4 K%/BB% in 36.1 IP, but he has still able to show the skills could potentially translate if given the leash. He has no leash though, and he has no rotation spot. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.33/55 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/155 in 160 IP

555) Cam Caminiti - ATL, LHP, 18.8 - Selected 24th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Caminiti has a lot of things working in his favor to give him the best chance at success. He has baseball bloodlines as the nephew of Ken Caminiti, he got drafted into one of the best pitching development organizations in baseball, and he's young for his class. He's not just narrative though, he has a strong foundation for Atlanta to build on at 6'2'', 205 pounds with a mid 90's fastball that is a whiff machine and has double plus potential. The secondaries aren't as refined, but he has a traditional starters pitch mix (slider, curve, change), and he also looked really good in his pro debut. He went 3 IP with 3 hits, 1 ER and a 4/0 K/BB at Single-A. The fastball sat low to mid 90's and the slider looked good. He threw the ball over the plate. I think #2/3 starter upside is fair to put on him right now, but he's so young with so much development time ahead, his range of outcomes is wide. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 12/3.71/1.18/190 in 180 IP

556) Tyson Lewis - CIN, SS, 19.3 -  Selected 51st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'2'', 195 pound Lewis is a high upside high school bat with at least plus speed, plus power potential, and a quick and powerful lefty swing. He's not the most refined high school bat, just recently undergoing a swing overhaul, and there are also some hit tool questions as he faces more advanced pitching. On pure upside, he rivals or surpasses Theo Gillen, but his bat isn't as safe and he's just not as refined. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 80/20/78/.259/.322/.438/23

557) Caleb Bonemer - CHW, SS, 19.6 - Selected 39th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bonemer has one of the top power/speed combos in the high school class with plus run times and electric bat speed. He's performed against advanced competition and has a good feel to hit. He doesn't have the smoothest batting stance/swing, which adds some hit tool risk, and he's not one of those obvious giant human beings with a 6'1'', 195 pound frame, but he's far from small. He's a big, physical guy. He's an excellent upside pick who should come at a reasonable price. I like Bonemer a lot - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 80/20/80/.256/.325/.440/20

558) AJ Smith-Shawver - ATL, RHP, 22.4 - Shawver was an absolute rocket ship in 2023, flying from the lower minors straight through to the majors, but he got a dose of reality in 2024. He put up a 4.86 ERA with a 28.5/11.0 K%/BB% in 87 IP at Triple-A. He might not have been the wunderkind we hoped for, but he's still a good pitching prospect with a 95 MPH fastball that gets good movement and misses bats. The secondaries are good too with a changeup that notched a 42.3% whiff% and 84.8 MPH EV, a slider that notched a 34.8% whiff% and 86.1 MPH EV, and a decent curve that notched a 81.6 MPH EV and 23.9% whiff%. That is 3 potentially above average to plus pitches with a decent 4th pitch. Even with below average control, that profile could work as a #3/4 type starter, but what would really pull this entire thing together is a big step forward in control/command. Atlanta is also a great organization to bet on for pitching prospects. He's more of a Top 200 guy than Top 100 one, so his value certainly took a hit, but I would try to stay strong one more year if you can. 2025 Projection: 4/4.32/1.36/83 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.95/1.31/155 in 150 IP

559) Yordanny Monegro - BOS, RHP, 22.5 - Monegro is one of my top pitching prospect targets relative his extreme lack of hype. He checks a hell of a lot of boxes with size (6'4'', 180 pounds), mid 90's velocity, diverse pitch mix, nasty secondaries, and excellent production. He put up a 2.73 ERA with a 30.8/9.8 K%/BB% in 66 IP at High-A. He has an explosive righty delivery with a mid 90s 4-seamer, 2-seamer, a nasty change, and 2 good breaking balls in his slider and curve. He's not a finished product as he has to continue to refine his control/command and all of his secondaries, plus he hasn't thrown that many innings in his career (76 IP was a career high this year), but all of that is way over factored into his price. He's a pretty special talent who has done nothing but dominate for the past two years when he's been on the mound. If he keeps it up at Double-A, his price should take a big jump in 2025. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 11/3.76/1.21/169 in 160 IP

560) Luis Morales - OAK, RHP, 22.6 - This isn't a comp, but Morales reminds me a lot of where Bubba Chandler was sitting last off-season. Like Chandler, Morales is a huge talent ($3 million signing bonus in 2023), with a scouts dream build at 6'3'', 190 pounds (although Chandler was more built up and wider), super obvious humongous stuff, below average control, and mediocre results at High-A. Morales put up a 4.22 ERA with a 24.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 81 IP at the level while Chandler put up a 4.75 ERA with a 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% in 106 IP at the level. Just because Chandler exploded to elite prospect status in 2024 doesn't mean Morales will, but that high end outcome is definitely in the cards. Morales' delivery is so easy and athletic it almost lulls you into a false sense of security before he fires off a mid to upper 90's fastball, a potentially plus breaking ball, and a promising, but still developing changeup. He can definitely still look pretty raw on the mound, making the bullpen a very possible destination long term, but this is the type of upside you want to chase. I was relatively high on Morales in his FYPD year, and I'm going to remain high on him headed into 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.78/1.29/168 in 155 IP

561) Gary Gill Hill - TBR, RHP, 20.7 - Gill Hill most certainly looks the part at 6'2'' with a super loose and athletic righty delivery. His nasty stuff has plus potential across the board with excellent movement on all of his pitches. The mid 90's fastball is a bat missing weapon, he can throw the plus breaking ball both in and out of the zone, and the changeup flashes plus as well. And while he's not a control artist, he has solid command over all of his pitches, especially relative to his age. It resulted in a 3.15 ERA with a 24.2/6.2 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at Single-A. If he keeps getting stronger, there could be another tick or two of velocity in here at peak, and his delivery is so easy he certainly has the potential to end up with plus command at peak too. He's young and needs to refine his game all around, but there is considerable upside in here, and the floor is about as high as it gets for a 19 year old pitcher in A ball. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 12/3.69/1.18/167 in 160 IP

562) Santiago Suarez - TBR, RHP, 20.3 - The 6'2'' Suarez has a bulldog mentality on mound, going right at hitters with a plus, mid 90's fastball that has good life. He combines the fastball with an above average breaking ball and cutter. He has excellent control of all of his pitches which allows them to play up. It resulted in a 4.11 ERA (2.97 xFIP) with a 25.7/4.7 K%/BB% in 111.2 IP at Single-A. Hill's stuff is a bit nastier, but Suarez easily has the command edge. I'll lean the nastier stuff, but they are pretty close to a coin flip for me. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 11/3.76/1.18/160 in 160 IP

563) Alan Roden - TOR, OF, 25.3 - Roden projects as a solid across the board corner outfielder, but he's already 25 years old, and with how high the offensive bar is for a corner outfielder, I'm not sure Roden's bat is quite good enough to clear that bar. Having said that, the guy has done nothing but rake in the minors, and he had another great year in 2024, slashing .293/.391/.475 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 14.2/12.1 K%/BB% in 125 games in the upper minors. He doesn't hit the ball particularly hard (87.6 MPH EV), he's not a burner, and he doesn't lift it a ton (7.4 degree launch). He's also going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. 2025 Projection: 31/8/34/.251/.312/.392/3 Prime Projection: 66/14/62/.269/.328/.414/10 Update: He looks damn good in spring. I was too low on him

564) Kaelen Culpepper - MIN, SS, 22.3 -  Selected 21st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 185 pound Culpepper is a proven college performer with solid across the board skills. He slashed .328/.419/.547 with 11 homers, 17 steals, and a 14.1%/12.0% K%/BB% in 61 games in the Big 12. He reminds me a lot of Minnesota's 2nd round pick in 2023, Luke Keaschall, who has similar size, speed, and feel to hit. Nothing jumps off the screen, but they get the job done in all facets of the game. Minnesota has had a lot of success with Keaschall, and Culpepper looks to be next with his strong pro debut. He cracked 3 homers with 4 steals, and a 13.4/9.8 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's a nice little "let him come to you" target in off-season prospect drafts right now. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/16/72/.268/.330/.420/18

565) Henry Bolte - OAK, OF, 21.8 - Bolte came into pro ball as a high risk, high reward $2 million dollar signing bonus 2nd round pick, and he's still a super talented high risk, high reward prospect. He's a tooled up 6'3'', 195 pounds who most certainly looks the part, and he showed off that upside at High-A with 11 homers, 28 steals, and a 159 wRC+ in 69 games. He showed off the risk too with a 31.8% K% and 54.5% GB%, and then he went to Double-A and the strikeout rate exploded to 38.8% in 54 games. Even with the high K rate though, his talent still shined in the upper minors in his age 20 year old season with 4 homers, 18 steals, and a 107 wRC+. The extremely high strikeout and groundball rates show how raw he still is, but if he can put up these kind of numbers this raw, imagine the upside if he can actually start improving on those skills. Considering his age and upside, along with the fact he isn't really all that hyped of a prospect, I'm more than fine going after Bolte at fair value, and if you want to lean pure upside, there is an argument for him to be 4th on this list. Just know the likelihood that he busts completely is high. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/17/62/.228/.306/.419/19

566) Elijah Green - WAS, OF, 21.4 - I almost wrote Green off completely this year after putting up a quite ridiculous 44% K% in 106 games at Single-A as a 20 year old, and honestly, maybe I still should, but it's so important to shoot for upside in the vast majority of dynasty leagues when it comes to prospects, that I believe his upside is still worth the shot in this area of the rankings. Even with that stupid strikeout rate, he still slashed .262/.342/.487 with 9 homers, 25 steals (only one caught stealing), and a 41.4/10.4 K%/BB% in his last 51 games. I don't even want to do that whole "if he can improve his hit tool" spiel because I couldn't even do it while keeping a straight face with that dumb stupid strikeout rate, but on the say 5-10% chance he can get that strikeout rate into the 30-35% range by his mid 20's, there is dangerous power/speed combo lurking in here to do the rest at an uber athletic 6'3', 225 pounds. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 59/21/72/.221/.302/.418/17

567) George Wolkow - CHW, OF, 19.3 - Wolkow was one of my favorite underrated FYPD Targets last off-season, and while he certainly still has his problems, he more than put his name on the map in 2024. The 6'7'' behemoth obliterated the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 148 wRC+ in 15 games, and then he got called up to Single-A as a an 18 year old and cracked 11 homers with 6 steals and a 126 wRC+ in 76 games. This is a no joke unicorn type talent, but like a lot of no joke unicorn type talents, the hit tool is a major question. And for Wolkow, it's getting close to off the charts with a 38.8% K% at stateside rookie and a 40.6% K% at Single-A. He walks a lot too, and he's very young, but that really isn't a strikeout rate you just hand wave away. It's why he really can't be close to consideration for a Top 100 spot, but it won't stop me from valuing him in the Top 200 range. The deeper you get into prospects rankings, the higher the bust rates become for everyone, so why not swing for the fences with a guy like Wolkow. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 75/28/87/.237/.319/.470/9

568) Chas McCormick - HOU, OF, 30.0 - I really liked McCormick coming into 2024, and he had such a terrible year I almost forgot he existed. It came out of nowhere too, as all of a sudden his EV dropped almost 2 MPH to 86.2 MPH, and everything else dropped with it. He ended the year with a 66 wRC+, 5 homers, and 8 steals in 94 games. I want to blame an injury or something, and he did injure his hamstring very early into the season, but the 28.7 ft/sec sprint was excellent, so blaming the injury seems like an excuse. The two major things he has going for him are that Houston's entire OF is wide open, and that his 2024 was such an outlier, he almost has to bounce back closer to career norms in 2025. He has a career .250 BA and the skills are there to go 20/20, but coming off the disastrous season, that feels like wishful thinking. A weak side of a platoon role (he hits lefties better than righties in his career) might be where he ends up. And he's 30 years old already. - 2025 Projection: 55/15/55/.240/.311/.410/13

569) Jonny DeLuca - TBR, OF, 26.9 - DeLuca was one of my favorite low key targets coming into the season, and the Rays did indeed teach him how to raise his launch considerably (16.2 degree launch), trying to give him that classic hit/lift/pull profile, but it just didn't click how they hoped (or I hoped) it would. He hit only 6 homers with a 84.6 MPH EV and .217 BA in 107 games. He didn't hit the ball hard enough to make it work, and the 21.3/6.6 K%/BB% wasn't good enough either. The Rays don't look to be giving up on him, penciling him as the starting CF (he's above average defensively), so if he hits the weight room and starts hitting the ball harder, maybe it can click in year two for him. He also has the speed (16 steals with an elite 29.8 ft/sec sprint) to give him upside if he can start to hit the ball harder. He won't have the Trop to help him out though even if he can, instead hitting at Yankee Stadium 2.0, which is not a good park for that kind of profile. He's a very low end flier right now. - 2025 Projection: 59/12/57/.234/.303/.381/19

570) Vance Honeycutt - BAL, OF, 21.10 - Selected 22nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Honeycutt is an elite athlete at 6'3'', 205 pounds with a plus to double plus power/speed combo (he went 28/28 in 62 games in the ACC) and plus CF defense. The only reason he even fell to 22nd, was because he is a strikeout machine with a 27.5% K%, and unfortunately, that risk was at the forefront in his pro debut with a 36.1% K% in 8 games at Single-A and a 55% K% in 5 games at High-A. The odds that he simply won't be able to hit MLB pitching nearly well enough to let his tools shine are quite high, but expecting the hit tool to be magically fixed in his first taste of pro ball was unrealistic. It was also a small sample. Let's see what Baltimore can do with him over a full off-season and season, because his upside is tremendously exciting. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 73/20/71/.223/.302/.428/17

571) James Tibbs III - SFG, OF, 22.6 - Selected 13th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, James Tibbs the Third sounds like he comes from generational wealth, in a family that can trace their lineage back to pre Revolutionary War times. I think his great great great great great great grandfather led the charge at Bunker Hill. He straight up even looks like one of those old timey pictures of a Civil War general. His bloodlines are so refined that he steps up to the plate with his pinkie up, and it's no surprise that he has one of the more refined plate approaches in the draft with a 11.6%/18.1% K%/BB% in 66 games. He's not a super tooled up guy at 6'0'', 200 pounds, but he has a powerful lefty swing that produced 28 homers in the ACC this year and 55 homers in 176 games in his career. He can definitely hit it hard. San Francisco is just about the worst landing spot for him as I'm not sure he has the no doubt raw juice to make him ballpark proof, which is why I'm lower on him than his draft slot. His mediocre pro debut also didn't assuage my fears about his lack of upside with a .636 OPS and 31/6.9 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. The only scenario I would honestly see myself drafting him is in like a 30 team league, or if he falls so far I simply don't have a choice (and even then I might keep on passing). Maybe this ranking is too low, but he's just not my guy. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/20/75/.261/.330/.432/8

572) Eduardo Beltre - MIN, OF, 18.6 - Beltre was one of the top DSL breakouts, slashing .326/.453/.618 with 11 homers, 10 steals, and a 23.8%/15.5% K%/BB% in 43 games. Those 11 homers were tied for 2nd in the league with Arnaldo Lantigua, and behind only Emil Morales' 14 bombs. He has an athletic righty swing with no doubt power. The K rate is a bit high and the tools aren't necessarily off the charts at 5'll'', but he signed for $1.5 million, so we are talking about a legit prospect here. His swing and offensive profile reminds me a lot of Orelvis Martinez, maybe with a bit less power and a bit more speed. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.252/.333/.458/10

573) Yorger Bautista - SEA, OF, 17.6 - Bautista looks like he was born with a bat in his hands when you watch him swing. He moves that bat in a totally controlled way like a samurai warrior, coolly crushing everything that comes his way with both power and contact. He was always known for his good feel to hit, and then he got much bigger and stronger at a rock solid 6'1'', 175 pounds, so he can end up with a truly potent hit/power combo. Then tack on the fact he also has plus speed, and you have one of, if not the most enticing prospects in the international class. I have Gonzalez #1 one right now, but Bautista is 1A for me. It's a coin flip with the tie going to Gonzalez' superior perceived value. I don't think you are going to have to go even close to this high to grab Bautista. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 91/25/93/.277/.351/.473/21

574) Tomoyuki Sugano - BAL, RHP, 35.6 - Sugana is a 35 year old who just put up an 18.3% K% in 156.2 IP in Japan, so we aren’t talking about big dynasty value here, but he can easily end up a solid win now piece. Here is Sugano himself talking about his arsenal and strategy in an MLB.com article by Adam Berry, “Obviously not a guy that throws 100 mph, but I’m very confident in my control, command, my pitch mix. That’s why I’ve had a lot of success in Japan. I’m not looking to really change anything now. I want to use my pitch selection, my pitch mix, my command to pitch in the States and see where it takes me from there.” That says it all as Sugano art of pitching’d his way to a 1.67 ERA and 0.95 WHIP in 2024, and a 2.43 ERA and 1.04 WHIP in his 1,873.1 IP career. The guy knows how to pitch, and while he’s not going to be an under 3 guy in MLB, I don’t see why his profile wouldn’t transfer. Baltimore wouldn’t have paid him $13 million if they didn’t think he could be effective. I would expect a #3/4 type starter with a high 3 ERA and low WHIP, but the lack of K’s and age still blunts his dynasty value. Putting him on a list like this is kinda pointless, because your league size and whether you are in win now mode will drive his value. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.88/1.18/120 in 150 IP

575) Jordan Montgomery - ARI, LHP, 32.3 - Boras took Montgomery's free agency super deep into the off-season, and it quite clearly threw off his entire season. He was awful and simply couldn't find a groove all season, putting up a 6.23 ERA with a 15.6/8.3 K%/BB% in 117 IP. It's so out of character from the rest of his career I find it hard to believe he won't bounce back after a normal off-season. The biggest red flag is that the sinker was down 1.5 MPH to 91.8 MPH, and that seems hard to completely blame a late build up for. Eventually you would think the velocity would have returned if he was actually fully healthy. The curve and changeup still missed plenty of bats though, so if his control/command and velocity returns in 2025, the ingredients for a bounce back are certainly in here. The upside wasn't high enough to begin with to give him too much leeway, but he shouldn't be written off because there is a clear reason for the terrible season. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.17/1.31/90 in 110 IP Update: It looks like he's the odd man out for a rotation spot

576) Mason Barnett - OAK, RHP, 24.5 - Barnett is a very reasonably priced, mid rotation upside arm who has nothing but opportunity in Oakland's rotation. He's a thick 6'0'', 218 pounds with a mid 90's fastball that has good life, a plus slider, good curve, and a decent changeup. He's not a control artist, but he's far from wild. He caught fire in the 2nd half of the season with a 2.03 ERA and 30.0/9.3 K%/BB% in his last 84.1 IP at Double-A. There is some bullpen risk, but that lessens considerably with how wide open Oakland's rotation is, and he checks plenty of boxes (good size, velocity, swing and miss, diverse pitch mix). The coming ballpark downgrade definitely makes me a little more hesitant to go after him than if they were sticking in Oakland, but Barnett definitely qualifies for that pitching prospect aisle that I love to shop in, and he gets a clear opportunity boost. - 2025 Projection: 4/4.29/1.34/91 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.92/1.28/150 in 150 IP

577) Sawyer Gipson-Long - DET, RHP, 27.4 - Gipson-Long underwent an internal brace procedure (or possibly Tommy John, it's not entirely clear) in April after his first outing of the season, and then he also underwent hip surgery in July. He's expected to be out until mid-season 2025, and it sure seems like he has a lot to come back from. I get writing him off until he proves he is healthy, as he was never a hyped pitching prospect either. But it's hard to write him off when you remember how good he was in his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 2.70 ERA with a 31.7/9.8 K%/BB% in 20 IP. His 35.0% whiff%, even in a small sample, is very impressive. His slider and changeup were untouchable and the 93.6 MPH 4-seamer and 92.4 MPH sinker performed well too. If he does get healthy, and if he can pick up from 2023, he definitely has impact fantasy starter upside. At this point in the rankings, I think it's worth hanging onto him. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.33/38 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.24/152 in 140 IP

578) River Ryan - LAD, RHP, 26.7 - Ryan underwent Tommy John surgery in August which will wipe out his entire 2025 season. He was breaking out on the MLB level before going down with the injury with a 1.33 ERA and 22.2/11.1 K%/BB% in 20.1 IP. He had the big stuff to back it up with a 96.3 MPH fastball, a diverse pitch mix, and bat missing secondaries. But like so many Dodgers pitchers in this category, who knows when he will be able to claw his way back into the rotation. He's good enough to not ignore, but he's not so good where I would say he's the type I love to take the Tommy John discount on. - 2025 Projection: OUT

579) Hurston Waldrep - ATL, RHP, 23.1 - Waldrep had an impressive pro debut in 2023 which had his stock rising, but his numbers weren't as impressive when he got to Double-A, and that proved to be a precursor for what to expect in 2024. He put up a 3.47 ERA with a 23.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. Those K/BB numbers are not very impressive against minor league competition, and he was atrocious in the majors with a 16.71 ERA and 8.3/22.8 K%/BB% in 7 IP. The devasting splitter lived up to the hype and is definitely an at least plus bat missing weapon, but that seems to really be all he has. The fastball sits in the mid 90's, but it doesn't miss many bats, the slider is average at best, and the control is well below average. This is a profile that can so easily end up in the bullpen, and it looks like it might be headed there right now. I'm not giving up on him as a starter, and he could be someone who transitions back into the rotation even if he starts his career in the pen, but this wasn't the year we wanted out of Waldrep. His value took a hit in 2024. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.09/1.34/58 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.56/1.26/77 in 68 IP

580) Logan Evans - SEA, RHP, 23.10 - Evans was a popular breakout pick late in the off-season, and while a 21.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 107 IP at Double-A isn't impressive enough for me to really love him, I would say he lived up to the breakout hype. He put up a 3.20 ERA, and the big stuff that got a lot of people very excited was most certainly there. He has a mid 90's fastball that keeps the ball on the ground to go along with an out pitch in his sweeper. He also has a diverse pitch mix with a curve, cutter and changeup. It seems more like a #4 type profile to me right now, but this was his first full year of pro ball, so more improvement is coming, and you have to love the organization/ballpark. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.34/45 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.87/1.29/147 in 160 IP

581) Jaden Hamm - DET, RHP, 22.7 - Hamm was one of the top statistical breakout pitchers in the minors with a 2.64 ERA and 30.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 99 IP. And he's not just stats, he has the talent to back it up with a plus low to mid 90's fastball and plus slider, to go along with an average change and curve. He combines that with about average control. He never made it to Double-A for even a cup of coffee, and I would really like to see how the profile plays against upper minors hitters before really flying him up the rankings, because I have a feeling that K rate is coming down against better competition. I see more #3/4 fantasy starter upside, but if his control/command takes a step forward, or he gains more velocity, or the changeup takes a step forward, he can beat that projection. - 2025 Projection: 1/4.35/1.34/24 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.90/1.25/160 in 160 IP

582) Brody Hopkins - TBR, RHP, 23.2 - The 6'4'', 200 pound Hopkins has funky righty delivery with the funky stuff to match. He slings a sometimes unreal, double plus slider that is his calling card. He combines that with a tailing mid 90's fastball that looks like he often has little idea where it is going to end up, and he rounds out the arsenal with a decent, lesser used changeup. It resulted in a 3.05 ERA with a 27.2/10.8 K%/BB% in 115 IP split between Single-A and High-A. There is definite control risk that seems like it will always be a part of his game with that funky delivery, so he very well might end up in the bullpen, but with a just a tad more refinement he could be a high K, mid rotation starter, and Tampa is a great team to bet on for that refinement. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.83/1.29/158 in 145 IP

583) Yoniel Curet - TBR, RHP, 22.5 - Curet is a thick 6'2'' with the build of a power NFL running back, and he uses that power to fire an electric mid to upper 90's fastball that is a double plus pitch. He combines the heat with a plus slider. He's been dominating the lower minors since 2021, so it was a big deal to see him keep up the production at Double-A where he put up a 1.75 ERA with a 35.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 25.2 IP. The control is below average and he lacks a good third pitch, so it definitely looks like a reliever profile right now, but he can be an elite high leverage one. He could also very well be a short outing, two times through the order starter. Where he ends up could be decided by how healthy and effective Tampa's rotation is when he's ready to get the call. - 2025 Projection: 1/3.77/1.30/23 in 20 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.35/1.20/85/26 saves in 65 IP

584) Luis Perales - BOS, RHP, 22.0 - Perales underwent Tommy John surgery in late June which will essentially knock out his entire 2025. It's such a bummer as he was going full breakout and keeping it up at Double-A. He put up a 2.94 ERA with a 38.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 33.2 IP at High-A and Double-A. The stuff is electric with a plus to double plus mid to upper 90's fastball. He made improvements to his changeup/splitter, which flashed nasty in 2024, and he rounds out the arsenal with a cutter and slider. He was a breakout candidate coming into the season because of the electric stuff, and it sure looked like the control and secondaries took real steps forward to combine with that stuff. He was on the path to be one of the most hyped pitching prospects this off-season before the injury. He wasn't quite established enough in the upper minors for me to love taking the TJ discount on, and he's not a big guy, so injury risk is a real downside, but the upside is certainly here, and he was on the verge of truly establishing himself. I would take him if the price is right, but I wouldn't stick my neck out. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 11/3.78/1.26/160 in 150 IP

585) Owen Murphy - ATL, RHP, 21.6 - Murphy was one of the top pitching prospect breakouts in 2024 with an uptick in stuff and dominant production, but the ghost of Tommy John got another one with Murphy undergoing Tommy John surgery in early June. That likely keeps him out for most or all of 2025, but it does give him enough of a cushion to prove he's healthy by the end of the season and possibly into the AFL, so there could be some budding hype by this time next year assuming full health. And if he hadn't gotten hurt, the hype could have been hitting hard already with a 1.54 ERA and 38.7/7.7 K%/BB% in 41 IP at High-A. The fastball only sits low 90's, but it gets a ton of movement and is a plus pitch. The slider and curveball both still need refinement, but the slider in particular will flash at least plus. And the control/command is potentially plus with an extremely easy and athletic righty delivery. He's not necessarily that in your face, upper 90's, mountain of a man pitching prospect (6'1'') that will get no doubt elite pitching prospect love, but he's the one who will sneak up on you real fast until he's all of a sudden doing it against MLB hitters. The injury obviously complicates things, but I like him enough to not have it kill his value. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.87/1.23/152 in 150 IP

586) JR Ritchie - ATL, RHP, 21.9 - If you want to make a case for Owen Murphy, you don't have to look very far, because JR Ritchie just showed what it looks like to have everything go smoothly returning from Tommy John almost the exact same time as Murphy underwent the surgery (just one year earlier obviously). Ritchie looked like he could have been headed for a breakout in 2023 before undergoing the surgery in late May, and he not only was able to return before the end of 2024, but he shined. He put up a 2.90 ERA with a 27.3/8.3 K%/BB% in 49.2 IP between 3 levels (rookie, A, A+). He looks the part at 6'2'', 185 pounds with a low to mid 90's fastball, starter's pitch mix, and potentially above average or better control/command. Both the slider and changeup are legit weapons, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out, and the fastball certainly has the ability to tick up into the mid 90's considering it was closer to the mid 90's before the injury. With a normal off-season, there is a chance he could look even stronger across the board in 2025, making him a very reasonably priced breakout option. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.27/154 in 160 IP

587) Emiliano Teodo - TEX, RHP, 24.2 - Teodo is likely a reliever long term with well below average control, but he most certainly has closer stuff, and it seems like he could be a heavy contender to eventually be Texas' closer of the future. And on the off chance he can remain a starter, the strikeout upside is there to make an impact for fantasy. He put up a 1.98 ERA with a 30.7/14.0 K%/BB% in 86.1 IP at Double-A. The fastball sits upper 90's and the slider is double plus. He also has a lesser used changeup that does have some potential. An upper 90's fastball with a wipeout secondary and below average control is a classic back of the bullpen profile to get excited about. If Texas makes the decision to bullpen him, he could end up in the majors before you know it. 2025 Projection: 2/3.88/1.29/32 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.42/1.19/80/32 saves in 65 IP

588) Ben Hess - NYY, RHP, 21.10 - Selected 26th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Hess is a high floor real life arm at 6'5'', 255 pounds with a mid 90's fastball and 3 legit secondaries in his slider, curve and changeup. He didn't pitch particularly well this year with a 5.80 ERA and 1.39 WHIP in 68.1 IP in the SEC, but the 34.8%/11.5% K%/BB% looks much better. I call him a "high floor real life arm" because as a college starter with his size, velocity and pitch mix, there is a very high probability he will be a major league arm in some capacity. But for fantasy, there is risk he ends up in the bullpen, or a back end starter if his control can't improve. I'm apt to bet on the size and stuff here, and his price should be very reasonable in First Year Players Drafts. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.95/1.32/165 in 160 IP

589) Jonathan Santucci - NYM, LHP, 22.3 - Selected 46th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Santucci had the type of talent to be in position to possibly be a top 10 pick with a huge season, but inconsistency dropped him into the 2nd round. He shows flashes of being a potentially impact MLB starter, but the control/command isn't there and 58 IP in his career high due to injuries. The stuff is filthy enough to thrive without great command, putting up a 3.41 ERA with a 35.0%/14.0% K%/BB% in 58 IP in the ACC. He's 6'2'', 205 pounds with an athletic lefty delivery, mid 90's fastball, plus slider, and average to above average change. There is a lot of risk here, both injury and control, but he's a high upside college arm who should come at a very reasonable price in drafts. I don't mind him as a "let him come to you" target in drafts. Don't reach. Let him fall into your lap. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.81/1.32/168 in 155 IP

590) Ryan Sloan - SEA, RHP, 19.2 - Selected 55th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Seattle went for a safer college starter in the first round, and then turned around and went for an upside high school starter in the 2nd. As I talked about in the June Mailbag Podcast, it made all the sense in the world for Seattle to focus on arms, and their entire draft was extremely arm heavy. Well done, Seattle. Sloan reminds me of Blake Wolters from the 2023 Draft, in that he looks the part and checks a lot of boxes. He's 6'4'', 225 pounds with a mid 90's fastball, potentially plus slider, and solid changeup. He controls all of his pitches relatively well. And you have to love Seattle as his landing spot. He's a very enticing high school arm. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 12/3.83/1.24/178 in 170 IP

591) Kale Fountain - SDP, 3B, 19.8 - Selected 151st in the 2024 MLB Draft, Fountain is a mountain of a man at 6'5'', 225 pounds, and he has the type of power befitting of his size with monster homer totals in high school. He's also a sneaky good athlete with above average run times. He was drafted in the 5th round but signed for $1.7 million, so this was a highly sought after prospect. There is definite hit tool risk, and he's on the old side for his class, but there is tons to like for fantasy. He reminds me of the Brandon Winokur of this year's draft, and Winokur just cracked my Top 100. Fountain is a definite target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/25/81/.240/.315/.462/9

592) Luke Dickerson - WAS, SS, 19.8 - Selected 44th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'0'', 190 Dickerson is a strong kid who won a state championship as as hockey player. You can see that toughness in the box with a powerful righty swing, and he combines that with good athleticism and speed. He signed for $3.8 million, which was the 21st highest signing bonus in the class and tells you how much Washington loved this kid. I do prefer a few other high school bats that got drafted in that 2nd round area over Dickerson, but it's hard to argue with that signing bonus, and his talent is right there with them. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.260/.330/.440/15

593) PJ Morlando - MIA, OF, 19.11 - Morlando was selected 16th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, and if he was picked by a team who I respected (like Xavier Isaac in 2022, or Ralphy Velazquez in 2023, or Braylon Payne this year), I might be inclined to go after him as a potentially plus hit/power bat at 6'3'', 200 pounds without much defensive value, but I just don't trust the Marlins with hitters. Morlando getting picked this high by them just doesn't warrant a bump in my book. But having said that, he certainly has big talent at the dish with big raw power and a great feel to hit. The wide and low batting stance just isn't my favorite type of swing and it isn't conducive to big game power, so he'll likely need a swing change to fully tap into that raw power. He's also old for the class, while the previously mentioned Isaac, Ralphy, and Payne were all young for the class. He got one plate attempt at Single-A before his season ended with a lumbar stress reaction in his back. Bit of a bummer to see a back injury so early into his career, but you can't read too much into it at this point. There is appeal, but despite the high draft slot, I'm not going out of my way to get Morlando. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/23/82/.262/.333/.458/5

594) Elian Pena - NYM, SS, 17.6 - Pena is expected to sign for the top bonus in the class (non Roki Sasaki division), and when you watch his lefty swing, it's easy to see why he has a potentially very exciting hit/power combo. He's only 5'10'', but he already has that sturdy trunk and hard hit ability that portends him being a bruiser in the box. And he combines that power potential with a good feel to hit and excellent approach. I definitely see the middle of the order masher potential, but like Josuar Gonzalez, I'm not sure I'm so blown away that I really want to stick my neck out for him. I'll take him if the price is right, but I'm not going to reach. Maybe I'm being too conservative at the moment, but that is how I would play it right now. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 86/26/91/.273/.348/.475/10

595) Cole Carrigg - COL, OF, 22.10 - I really wish we could have seen Carrigg at Double-A, because it's hard for me to buy in too hard here as an advanced college bat in the lower minors. The Rockies High-A park is also notoriously hitter friendly, with many of their hitters immediately falling off in their Double-A ballpark. At best, you can use his lack of time at Double-A as a buying opportunity, because there is a lot to like, but at worst, it could be a trap. The rosy outlook on Carrigg is that he's 6'2'', 200 pounds with about average power (16 homers in 111 games at High-A), an average hit tool (19.0/9.8 K%/BB%), double plus baserunning (53 steals), and defensive versality which should add value. The less rosy outlook is that the hit tool drops to below average at higher levels and he won't have the power to make up for it, relegating him to a utility role. If we saw it at Double-A, I would be more apt to buy into the first narrative, but until I do, I'm staying a little cautious. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/16/67/.262/.323/.417/28

596) Ty Johnson - TBR, RHP, 23.6 - Johnson absolutely blew up after his trade to the Rays, putting up a 0.78 ERA with a 46.4/4.8 K%/BB% in 23 IP at High-A. He was pitching well all season with Chicago too, but Tampa tweaked his arm slot to that at the ear fastball, and it gave High-A hitters fits. He's a tall drink of water at 6'6'', 205 pounds, and he uses that frame to fire that heavily used, mid 90's fastball that is a plus pitch, to go along with a plus slider. He doesn't have a third pitch and there is definitely bullpen risk, but let's see what Tampa can do with a full off-season of him. Finding a third pitch could unlock mid rotation upside. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/3.91/1.24/140 in 140 IP

597) Hyun-Seok Jang - LAD, RHP, 21.0 - I just couldn't resist writing up Jang even though he didn't crack the Top 10, because if there is one pitcher in the minors who can jump into near elite pitching prospect range extremely quickly into 2025, it's Jang. If he has literally a few good outings to start the season, maybe even just one good outing, the hype is going to hit really damn hard. He was one of my top FYPD pitching targets last off-season, and while his control/command was too raw to say he was a major hit, he more than showed the upside that I just can't resist. He put up a ridiculous 41% K% in 36.2 IP split between rookie ball (41.5%) and Single-A (39.6%). He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with an athletic righty delivery that fires a mid 90's fastball that can reach the upper 90's, to go along with a 2 potentially plus breakers (slider, curve), and a developing changeup that flashes plus. He was improving as the year progressed with a 2.19 ERA in 12.1 IP at Single-A (6.14 ERA on the season), which is a good sign, but the 16.3% BB% remained high all year, and that is just way too high. He has the type of stuff that can thrive with below average control, but he has work to do to get to even that. The way I see it, the raw control gives you one more off-season to get in for cheap or possibly nothing before he really starts to pop. Last year was his first year in a new country and his first year in pro ball. There was a lot of adjusting to do, and I think he's going to look a lot more comfortable in year 2. He's a major target. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 11/3.69/1.28/180 in 160 IP

598) Daniel Espino - CLE, RHP, 24.3 - Sometimes you just gotta say eff it. If you said eff it with Kumar Rocker and held onto him, it would have paid off in a major way for you this year. Rocker had both shoulder and elbow surgeries. Granted, Espino's shoulder problems seem way more serious with him missing all of 2024 with another shoulder surgery. He hasn't pitched since 2022. But his stuff was so off the charts nasty with upper 90's heat, a plus slider, and a diverse pitch mix, that I think it's worth it to just say eff it. Maybe he's a shell of his former self. Maybe he keeps getting hurt. Or maybe he ends up in the bullpen. But on the off chance that his shoulder actually does get back to full health, he has the potential to Kumar Rocker the minors. From an afterthought to an elite, hyped pitching prospect in the blink of an eye. I'm going to hold on to see where it goes. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 3/3.81/1.29/65 in 60 IP

599) Danny Jansen - TBR, C, 30.0 - Jansen couldn't have landed in a better spot, immediately becoming Tampa's far and away clear starter. I thought he was going to be able to land a full time job, but nothing was guaranteed after his poor 2024. His EV tanked to 86.6 MPH, and it resulted in a .206 BA with 9 homers and a 89 wRC+ in 94 games. He's about average on defense, so without an above average bat, it was up in the air on how teams were going to view him, but Tampa is so weak at catcher, he is also going to get an extremely long leash. He's only 30, and he has a long track record of above average Barrels, a high launch, and above average contact rates, so the potential is in here to have a truly impact offensive catcher season. If you wait on catcher, he's a decent last man standing type of pick. - 2025 Projection: 56/17/61/.225/.313/.419/0

600) Brayan Rocchio - CLE, SS, 24.3 - I've been calling Rocchio a sell for a few years now as he was getting Top 100 Prospect love (and actually like Top 20 prospect love on some lists), and after his rough rookie year in 2024, any trade value he had left is probably gone. He slashed .206/.298/.316 with 8 homers, 10 steals, and a 20.4/10.0 K%/BB% in 143 games. The .275 xwOBA backs up the terrible surface stats. He has a good SS glove, the plate approach is solid, and he he seems to have a lock on the starting SS job, but with an 84.6 MPH EV, 26.8 ft/sec sprint, and 69.5 MPH swing, there really isn't all that much hope for an impact fantasy player. Maybe he can put together some .260/15/15 seasons at peak, but even that would be a high end outcome. - 2025 Projection: 68/11/51/.237/.313/.362/12

601) Geraldo Perdomo - ARI, SS, 25.4 - I know that Perdomo has a good glove at SS, and I know he is a clubhouse leader, but I still think he's just keeping the seat warm for Jordan Lawlar. I don't think his bat is good enough to be an MLB starter long term with a .281 xwOBA in 98 games. But having said that, there are some strings you can pull out to hope for future offensive improvement. For one, his surface stats beat his underlying numbers with a 98 wRC+ in 2023 and a 101 wRC+ in 2024. His contact rates are near elite with a 14.9% K%, and he has a good approach too with a 9.3% BB%. If he can start to hit the ball a bit harder as he gets into his mid 20's, I guess it's possible for his bat to be just good enough to be a starting SS, but I don't think good teams want just good enough. They want Jordan Lawlar, and I think Lawlar is coming to take this job. Even if Perdomo does hold him off and hits his peak, the upside just isn't there without power or speed. - 2025 Projection: 74/9/49/.255/.329/.382/14 Update: Arizona signed Perdomo to an extension, which is a clear vote of confidence that he is their guy at SS. I still don't love him though

602) Tirso Ornelas - SDP, OF, 25.1 - Ornelas was once upon a time a popular sleeper bat back in 2018 as a 19 year old, and while he didn't have the explosion many hoped for, here he is popping back up on the radar in 2025. The 6'4'', sweet lefty swinging Ornelas slashed .297/.367/.497 with 23 homers, 7 steals, and a 16.1/9.7 K%/BB% in 128 games at Triple-A. The 87.6 MPH EV and 8.4 degree launch don't exactly scream big time power hitter in the majors, but the raw power is definitely in there, and the contact rates were really good. It's probably a bench bat long term, but San Diego is a very thin team right now, so Ornelas is in position to get plenty of at-bats in 2025. It's also not out of the question for him to level up again if he can raise his launch, and his teammate Jackson Merrill is a perfect guy to talk to about that. He's not a bad underrated proximity bat at all for deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 41/10/47/.238/.303/.409/2 Prime Projection: 43/12/51/.260/.321/.435/3

603) Juan Brito - CLE, 2B/3B, 23.6 - Brito isn't a good defensive player and Cleveland has started to move him all over the field (1B, 2B, 3B, OF), which isn't a good sign because he doesn't really have that no doubt offensive upside either. But his season at Triple-A was too good to ignore. He slashed .256/.365/.443 with 21 homers, 13 steals, and a 16.1/13.5 K%/BB% in 144 games. The 87.3 MPH EV isn't great, but it's not terrible, and it came with a 17.5 degree launch and a 47% Pull%. We know that a strong plate approach with a lift and pull profile can most certainly work. If he can get into the lineup, and he has opportunity at 2B before Bazzana arrives, he should be a rock solid MLB hitter, but his glove could cause problems on that front long term. - 2025 Projection: 22/5/27/.241/.302/.394/2 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.259/.328/.430/8

604) Patrick Bailey - SFG, C, 25.10 - It looked like Bailey was breaking out with an excellent 1st half of the season, putting up a .784 OPS pre break in 69 games, but it fell apart in the 2nd half with a .434 OPS in his final 52 games. It's the 2nd year in a row he's massively underperformed his underlying numbers with a .319 xwOBA vs. .281 wOBA, and he hit the ball extremely hard with a 91.2 MPH EV, so there are some positive takeaways here. His plate approach also took a step forward with a very solid 22.3/8.7 K%/BB%. We've talked a lot about how catchers take much longer to develop offensively, so Bailey could be on that late 20's breakout track, although his home ballpark will subdue whatever breakout he does have. - 2025 Projection: 54/13/58/.249/.312/.385/3

605) Edgar Quero - CHW, C, 22.0 - Quero is a super safe catcher prospect who had a clear path to playing time, but after the Kyle Teel trade, he's going to have to battle it out. He's had an excellent plate approach his entire professional career, putting up a 17.4/9.7 K%/BB% in 98 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. There is some juice in his bat too with 16 homers, but there isn't huge raw power at 5'10'' (87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A), and the launch isn't very high either (7.2 degrees at Triple-A). It's an above average hit/power combo in the minors which might play as an average hit/power combo in the majors, but at only 22 years old, you can give him a bump for age to level. He's the type that has more value the deeper the league is, because I'm seeing more of a solid than standout hitting catcher. - 2025 Projection: 36/10/41/.246/.305/.391/1 Prime Projection: 66/17/72/.266/.339/.429/3

606) Michael Massey - KCR, 2B, 27.0 - The Royals brought in India this off-season, and while it seems they still have room for Massey to get full time at bats, it's not great for him. The bigger problem is that he's just not that good. He's not bad though either, which is what keeps him on the radar. He's coming off his best season where he put up a .743 OPS with 14 homers in 100 games, but it came with 1 steal, a .259 BA and a 4.2% BB%. The 7.1% Barrel% is about average, the 92.8 MPH FB EV isn't all that great, and the ballpark is terrible. He improved his hit tool with a career best 15.7% K%, but it came at the cost of his plate approach with a career worst 37.4% Chase. The fantasy upside is capped and the real life upside is capped too. There is also no guarantee of full time at bats. He's a very low end option. - 2025 Projection: 61/17/69/.250/.300/.416/4

607) Thairo Estrada - COL, 2B, 29.1 - Estrada signed a 1 year, $3.25 million contract with the Rockies, and the contract number really says it all. Estrada is not a very sought after player, and while having a starting job and hitting in Coors clearly bumps up his value, I'm not targeting him. The Coors bump isn't close to what it used to be, and he only stole 2 bags in 96 games last year, which is where he derived most of his value. He's never had an above average xwOBA in any season in his entire career, and it bottomed out to .263 in 2024. Having a job puts him back on the late round radar, but that is about it. He's also just keeping the seat warm for Adael Amador, so he might not even hold onto the starting job for very long. - 2025 Projection: 66/13/49/.258/.310/.408/13

608) Lenyn Sosa - CHW, 2B/3B, 25.2 - Sosa is in a scrum with a bunch of Chicago prospects for their middle infield jobs, and unfortunately, I don't think he is going to be one of the players to emerge, but that will proven on the field. He hits the ball pretty hard with a 89.0/93.0 MPH AVG/FB EV, he can lift it with a 12.3 degree launch, and he can get the bat on the ball with a 20.9% K%. That's not a bad collection of skills, and while it only resulted in an 80 wRC+ in 100 games, a lot of that was due to back luck with an average .316 xwOBA. The plate approach is terrible (3.3% BB%), he doesn't run, and he's not particularly good on defense, so I don't think he's a full time player, and guys like Colson Montgomery, Bryan Ramos, Miguel Vargas, Chase Meidroth and even Jacob Gonzalez are all going to pass him on the depth chart quite soon. - 2025 Projection: 35/11/42/.250/.298/.410/3

609) Jerar Encarnacion - SFG, OF, 27.5 - Encarnacion is highly likely to top out as a bench power bat, but he's a bench power bat with very real upside. His 77 MPH swing is almost all you need to know that his upside is very real. And he smashes the ball with a 15% Barrel% and 95 MPH EV in 35 games in the majors. It led to 5 homers and a .348 xwOBA. That xwOBA is no joke. The .301 wOBA wasn't as good, and I do think that matters, and the 28.6/4.2 K%/BB% is quite terrible, which I obviously think matters a ton. He's also not a high launch guy with a 6.7 degree launch. And he's bad on defense. It's a very classic bench power bat, but man, anybody who swings that fast and hits it that hard has at least some of my attention. - 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.237/.306/.424/2

610) Everson Pereira - NYY, OF, 24.0 - Pereira's season ended on May 19th after undergoing elbow surgery. He was doing his usual big power, big strikeout thing before going down with the injury with 10 homers and a 32.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 40 games at Triple-A. That K rate at Triple-A is scary, and it was even worse when he got a shot in the majors in 2023 with a 38.8% K% and 43.1% whiff%. But strikeouts aside, Pereira is an exciting talent with the ability to crush the ball and above average speed. He's basically obliterated every stop of the minors. These guys generally get a shot at some point in time, often with the Miami Marlins of the world, and the fantasy upside is worth staying patient with. With Juan Soto now officially a goner, maybe Pereira's status in the Yankees organization gets a little bump, and even if he isn't handed a starting job (which he won't be), he might hang around in that next man up territory. He's a bit more interesting to me now than he was before Soto signing with the Mets. 2025 Projection: 28/10/35/.222/.291/.424/5 Prime Projection: 71/24/78/.235/.312/.454/12 Update: Stanton injury could open the door a crack for Pereira

611) Drew Gilbert - NYM, OF, 24.6 - A hamstring injury knocked out 3 months of Gilbert's season, and he couldn't get comfortable until the final month where he went bonkos with 9 homers, 2 steals, and a 16.2/10.3 K%/BB% in his last 29 games at Triple-A. It was more of the same in the AFL with 3 homers and a 5/8 K/BB in 11 games. But the batting average didn't follow behind with a .200 BA in the AFL and a .222 BA during that hot streak at Triple-A, and I'm not sure it's purely bad luck. He only had a 85 MPH EV at Triple-A to go along with a 46.9% FB%, which is a recipe for a low batting average. The Mets ballpark also isn't the right park for that kind of profile with it being one of the worst parks for lefty homers this year. He's had less extreme flyball rates in the past, but with the mediocre at best EV's, I don't think it's going to matter much, and while he runs a bit, it doesn't seem like he will rack up steals. He's close to the majors and he can definitely end up a solid fantasy player, but it's not someone I'm going after unless it's a deeper league. - 2025 Projection:.25/5/29/.235/.301/.395/3  Prime Projection: 76/18/74/.251/.322/.428/13

612) Wilfred Veras - CHW, OF, 22.4 - Veras is one of my favorite underrated proximity stashes in the minor leagues right now. He has that perfect mix of talent, upside, production, path to playing time, and absolutely non existent hype. He's 6'2'' with a big righty swing that has easy plus power potential, and he used that to club 16 homers in 128 games at Double-A. He's not a burner but he loves to run, stealing 25 bags in 34 attempts, and I don't see why Chicago wouldn't let him run, especially if they are going to be bad for the next few years. And the most exciting part is that he at least hinted at improving his well below average plate approach in the 2nd half of the season with a 23.2/8.7 K%/BB% in his final 70 games. He was only 21 years old in the upper minors with a 118 wRC+, and his biggest weakness, the plate approach, showed signs of improving. I love taking some high risk, high reward shots on guys who aren't teenagers, so Veras is in that perfect zone of upside and proximity for a cheap price that isn't always easy to find. - 2025 Projection: 27/8/36/.221/.280/.389/5 Prime Projection: 69/22/78/.246/.309/.442/13

613) Miguel Bleis - BOS, OF, 21.1 - We already knew that Bleis was not going to be that rocket ship elite prospect that we hoped for after his disappointing 2023 season, and as often happens with these uber talented, close to a breakout but never quite breaks out prospects (see Alex Ramirez), they can just sit in the breakout waiting room for years, sometimes all the way into their late 20's. So I fear Bleis is going to get comfortable in this breakout waiting room, but that is where he is after another mediocre at best season. He conquered Single-A with a 123 wRC+, but he was a 20 year old repeating the level, and he struggled when he got to the more age appropriate High-A with a 70 wRC+ in 50 games. That hit tool is still quite raw with a .221 BA on the season. The good news is that the upper echelon talent is still here with 11 homers, 38 steals, and a lift and pull profile. The hit tool isn't good, but a 21.4/9.1 K%/BB% isn't too bad. He also has a good glove in the OF. Is he just Alex Ramirez 2.0? Probably. But even Alex Ramirez can still breakout down the line, and Bleis certainly can too. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/20/71/.241/.309/.417/23

614) Yophery Rodriguez - MIL, OF, 19.4 - Rodriguez didn't have the flashiest season with 7 homers, 7 steals, a .726 OPS and a 23.8/12.2 K%/BB% in 110 games at Single-A, but it resulted in a 117 wRC+, and when you take into account he was an 18 year old who skipped over stateside rookie ball, it's much more impressive. He has a whip quick lefty swing, and he has good size at 6'1'', 185 pounds, so he should be able to get to above average to plus power at peak. He's also an excellent athlete who signed for $1.5 million in 2023, although he needs to improve his base stealing (19 for 31 in his career and 7 for 12 this year). More refinement is needed in all areas of his game, which is to be expected at this stage in his career, but it's not hard to see an above average across the board player at peak. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/80/.266/.344/.451/10

615) Yanquiel Fernandez - COL, OF, 22.3 - Fernandez simply didn't have a good enough year for a bat only prospect. He put up a 98 wRC+ with 12 homers in 122 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. The plate approach is really bad (7.2% BB%), the hit tool is below average (.262 BA with a 19.4% K%), he's almost a literal zero in steals, and the launch isn't great either with a 44.1% GB%. Don't get me wrong, I still love that sweet lefty swing and big power potential, but his bat really needed to be pretty bulletproof as the climbed the minors, and it just wasn't in 2024. He's a guy who is going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. I don't hate him, but it's just not a profile that deserves to get ranked very highly right now. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.228/.281/.398/0 Prime Projection: 66/24/71/.251/.318/.451/1

616) Paulino Santana - TEX, OF, 18.4 - Leodalis De Vries, Paulino Santana, and Emil Morales were my top 3 targets from last year's international class, and while De Vries and Morales have gone full blow up, Santana is still sitting in a very reasonable price range. He didn't hit for nearly enough power to be a coveted prospect with 0 homers in 53 games in the DSL, but everything else was there with a 14.6/20.0 K%/BB%, 20 steals, and a 142 wRC+. He's a projectable 6'2'', 180 pounds and he didn't have any major groundball or pull issues with a 35.4% flyball percentage and a 49% Pull%, so the game power should tick up naturally over time as the raw power starts coming in. The super quick and super athletic righty swing that made me fall in love with him is still fully present. The big breakout hasn't come yet, but I still think it's coming down the line. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/20/76/.278/.347/.446/28

617) Kash Mayfield - SDP, LHP, 20.3 - Selected 25th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Mayfield has prototypical size at 6'4'', 200 pounds with a deceptive lefty delivery that hides the ball well, before releasing it with a short arm action and 3 quarter arm slot. The deception and movement on the fastball allows the low to mid 90's pitch play up. He combines the heater with two potentially plus secondaries in his slider and changeup, to go along with potentially plus control/command. He's old for the class and seems a bit more floor over upside at the moment, but there is plenty here for San Diego to work with. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 11/3.91/1.22/160 in 165 IP

618) Cade Smith - CLE, Setup, 25.11 - Cade Smith had the most valuable 4-seam fastball in all of baseball last year. And that is not on a per pitch basis. That is overall, which is even more impressive for a reliever to hold the top spot there. And it also wasn't even close. That pitch put up a 28 run value while the next closest was Hunter Greene with 20. It resulted in an unreal season with a 1.91 ERA and 35.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 75.1 IP. He was almost even more impressive in the post season with a 3.60 ERA and 43.2/5.4 K%/BB% in 10 IP. He's obviously really good, but I'm not sure the underlying stats show him to be quite that good (which would be hard for anyone to maintain). The 30.2% whiff% is good, but not as good as the K rate, and none of his pitches put up more than a 30.4% whiff%. The splitter was an excellent pitch with a .231 xwOBA, but it only had a 29.9% whiff%, and the sweeper wasn't very good. He also got hit relatively hard with a 90.4 MPH EV and 8.4% Barrel% against. Hard to say he still isn't one of the top setup men to go after in 2025, but I don't know, I'm going to at least be keeping in mind that there could be some regression next year. - 2025 Projection: 5/2.84/0.96/94/3 saves in 70 IP

619) Bryan Abreu - HOU, Setup, 27.11 - Abreu wasn't quite as good in 2024 as he was in 2022-23, but he was still elite with a 3.10 ERA and 31.7/9.8 K%/BB% in 78.1 IP. He's firmly established as one of the top setup men in the game, if not the top guy. Hader is locked into the closer role, but an injury would turn Abreu into an elite closer immediately, and a Hader trade could also get him into the role, but I guess in that scenario, Abreu could be the next one out the door anyway. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.02/1.15/93/5 saves in 70 IP

620) Aroldis Chapman - BOS, Closer Committee, 37.1 - Chapman and Hendriks will battle it out for the closer role in Spring, and I guess it's conceivable they form a committee if both are pitching well. If I had to bet on one taking the role though, Chapman seems like the safer, more predictable choice. He's still an absolute strikeout machine with a 37.1% K% in 61.2 IP. He's a wild man too with a 14.4% BB%, and it all resulted in a 3.79 ERA and 2.98 xERA. His fastball velocity is in decline, but he had so much to spare that he's still throwing 97.8 MPH. The 32.3% whiff% isn't quite as impressive as the K%, and it's not as good as previous seasons, and his 90.5 MPH EV against is a career worst by far. Those are 3 signs of decline, along with the terrible walk rates, and he's going to be 37. I may give the edge to Chapman, but it's possible his decline continues in 2025, so nothing is certain. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.57/1.29/89/20 saves in 60 IP

621) Liam Hendriks - BOS, Closer Committee, 36.2 - Hendriks returned from Tommy John surgery in August for a rehab assignment at Triple-A. His stuff was down 2 ticks and he didn't look great over 5 outings. He then went back on the IL after suffering a setback. All indications are that he's having a normal off-season and will be ready to go for 2025, but who knows exactly how healthy he's going to look. He missed almost the entire 2023 and 2024 season, and he's 36 years old. He was basically the Jacob deGrom of relief pitchers before going down with the injury, putting up minuscule ERA's with like a 40.0/3.0 K%/BB%, so I guess even a diminished version of himself can be very good, but there is also a chance the cliff has come, and he will just never be close to the same. The upside is higher than Chapman, but so is the risk. Seeing how he looks in Spring will swing his value majorly. -2025 Projection: 2/3.75/1.20/45/10 saves in 40 IP

622) Mason Montgomery - TBR, Setup, 24.10 - Montgomery got transitioned to the bullpen in 2024, and to say he took to it well would be an understatement. He absolutely exploded with a 1.86 ERA and 45.9/13.5 K%?BB% in 9.2 IP. His stuff exploded too with a 97.3 MPH fastball that put up a 43.1% whiff%, to go along with a slider that put up a 56% whiff%. The control is below average, but this looks like it can end up a truly elite pen arm. And it's not like Tampa's pen is set in stone. He could emerge as a true elite closer option quite quickly, even if being a lefty makes it hard to really bank on that, and also the fact he can go multiple innings. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.39/1.19/90/3 saves in 70 IP

623) Jason Foley - DET, Closer Committee, 29.5 - Foley saved 28 games in 2024, so he's the presumed favorite for saves, but his hold on the role seems very precarious. Detroit would also be a candidate to trade for a pen arm during the season even if Foley can make it through the off-season. His strikeout rates just aren't good enough to feel safe with him with a 18.4/8.0 K%/BB% in 60 IP. He had a 3.15 ERA and he has a career 3.16 ERA in 199.2 IP, so it's certainly possible he can hang onto the role. He does it with a 96.9 MPH sinker that keeps the ball on the ground to go along with an above average slider. He's a very low end option. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.45/1.21/52/20 saves in 63 IP

624) Alexis Diaz - CIN, Closer, 28.6 - Diaz showed signs of imploding in the 2nd half of 2023, and that proved to be a signal, as he was pretty bad in 2024. He put up a 3.99 ERA with a 22.7/12.8 K%/BB%. The velocity dropped for the 2nd year in a row and now sits at a pedestrian 93.9 MPH. The whiffs on his slider also dropped off a cliff with a 29.8% whiff%. And the control remained well below average. He was bad all season, so it's also not the case of a small blip bringing all the stats down. It seems like Diaz is still the favorite for the job, but I'm not sure why. He shouldn't be at all. Cincy has better options, and I just can't trust that Diaz will actually get the first shot at it. We'll see how he looks in spring, but as of now, I'm too shaky to go after him even as a saves needy team. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.89/1.28/70/15 saves in 65 IP

625) Chris Martin - TEX, Closer, 38.10 - Martin is currently penciled in as the Rangers closer, but let's see where Kenley and Robertson land before feeling too comfortable with that. Even if they don't sign anyone, he doesn't feel all that secure in the role. He's also liable to lose the role by the trade deadline even if he does start the season as the closer. He's the rarer elite control bullpen arm with a 3.45 ERA and 27.8/1.7 K%/BB% in 44.1 IP. The 23.9% whiff% is below average, so I wouldn't buy into that K% too hard. He mostly dominated with a plus cutter that had a 45.5% usage, .260 xwOBA and 27.6% K%. If you wait on closer, beggers can't be choosers, so he's the type of low cost option you will be looking at. And then just cross your fingers he holds the role. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.49/1.14/57/20 saves in 55 IP

626) Robert Garcia - TEX, Setup, 28.10 - Garcia is the best lefty in Texas' bullpen, and if they don't sign anyone, Chris Martin seems like a relatively shaky (or more accurately, not locked in) option that possibly could be passed at some point during the season. No guarantee they go to Garcia, but he could start to see more and more save chances regardless. He put up a 2.53 xERA (4.22 ERA) with a 29.9/6.4 K%/BB% in 59.2 IP. He throws 3 good pitches with his changeup being the standout with a .193 xwOBA and 37.2% whiff%. There are ingredients in here for him to breakout, and even as a lefty, maybe he can emerge as the guy. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.56/1.19/75/15 saves in 62 IP

627) Jason Adam - SDP, Setup, 33.8 - Suarez showed some cracks in the armor in 2024, and while he's clearly the incoming favorite for the job, Adam seems to be next in line if he falters. Adam is also better than Suarez with a 1.96 ERA and 28.7/8.2 K%/BB% in 73.2 IP. His stuff backs up the production with a plus, bat missing mid 90's fastball to go along with 3 whiff machines secondaries. If San Diego just chooses to go with the best pitcher, and not worry about track record, maybe they do just give the job to Adam. It's worth noting that Jeremiah Estrada is a beast too, but I think track record gives the edge to Adam in the short term if Suarez gets ousted. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.13/1.06/78/10 saves in 65 IP

628) Taylor Rogers - CIN, Setup, 34.3 - Diaz is as shaky as it gets right now, and Rogers has experience as a closer, saving 31 games in 2022, so it's possible Rogers is the guy if Diaz falters. He's a lefty though, and Cincy has other options even beyond him, so even next man up status is far from certain. Either way, he could be in the mix, and he's coming off a strong season where he put up a 2.40 ERA and 25.9/8.8 K%/BB% in 60 IP. The sinker velocity has been on the decline, sitting at 93 MPH, and the sweeper is a good pitch, but not a great pitch. He seems to be declining, and he's solid, but he's not really great. I think Cincy might go another way even if it's not Diaz, but again, who knows. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.68/1.26/66/9 saves in 60 IP

629) David Robertson - FRA, Closer, 40.0 - Who knows if Robertson can find a closer job this off-season, but even at 40 years old he has the production to find one, and there are more than a few possible landing spots. Going back to Texas seems mighty obvious, and he would close there. He just put up a 3.00 ERA with a 33.3/9.4 K%/BB% in 72 IP. He dominates with a heavily used cutter, which I'm pretty sure he learned from the legend himself, Mariano Rivera. He's 40 and it's hard to value him highly in dynasty regardless, but if I had to guess, I'm guessing he finds a closer job. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.39/1.17/78/25 saves in 65 IP

630) Curtis Mead - TBR, 2B/3B, 24.5 - Mead isn't good on defense, he hits lefties much better than righties, he has below average speed, he doesn't walk a ton, and he's not really a big power hitter. That is just a lot of negatives to overcome. The hit tool is good, but it's not great. He's been terrible in the majors with 2 homers, 2 steals, a 78 wRC+ and a 22.8/5.8 K%/BB% in 224 PA. He's only 24, and I do still think he can become a solid MLB hitter, but the upside isn't very high even if he can reach that upside. - 2025 Projection 18/4/22/.248/.304/.391/1 Prime Projection: 58/16/66/.263/.317/.422/6

631) Brett Baty - NYM, 3B, 25.4 - Baty's best shot at an opportunity closed when Alsono resigned with the Mets. He had that opportunity in 2024 and failed with a 83 wRC+ in 50 games, resulting in him getting sent down to Triple-A, but he laid down some skills that should result in him reaching his solid MLB hitter destiny if he's ever given the chance again. His 73.5 MPH swing is plus and the contact rates weren't bad at all with a 24.6% K% and 26.2% whiff%. He didn't hit the ball hard with a 86.6 MPH EV, which was the problem, but there is zero doubt that he has considerably more in the tank than that at 6'2'', 210 pounds. He hit the ball hard in 2023 in the majors, so he's proven it too. He also destroyed Triple-A with 16 homers and a 21.2/12.3 K%/BB% in 62 games, which doesn't mean that much, but it's something. The high groundball rates and 10.3 degree launch is why I always cautioned against his 5x5 fantasy upside, because the game power probably isn't huge, but I always thought Baty was going to end up one of those damn good "professional" hitters, and I still think he should reach that peak. It doesn't look like it's going to happen in 2025 though, and he's already 25 years old. Time is kinda running out - 2025 Projection: 35/10/38/.247/.321/.416/1

632) Thomas Saggese - STL, 2B/3B/SS, 23.0 - Saggese was always a guy who produced above his tools, demanding respect in the prospect world despite being a 5th round pick, but pro ball finally caught up with him at Triple-A. He put up 93 wRC+ with a 23.1/5.9 K%/BB% in 125 games. He then got a cup of coffee in the majors where he struggled hard with a 57 wRC+ and 26.9/3.8 K%/BB% in 52 PA. He just doesn't hit the ball hard enough (87.3 MPH at AAA and 85.7 MPH in the majors), or have good enough plate skills (see K/BB above), or run enough (9 steals) to be too enticing of a fantasy prospect. There also isn't much defensive value, so it's not like the glove will force him on the field. I'm not saying he can't be a solid bat at peak, because I think he can be, I'm just not too enthused about rostering him until it maybe happens. - 2025 Projection: 25/5/29/.237/.293/.389/2 Prime Projection: 66/19/74/.259/.318/.420/8

633) Shay Whitcomb - HOU, 3B, 26.6 - If Whitcomb had a starting job, or even some semblance of a path to a full time job, I would really love him, but he really doesn't have a path. And at already 26 years old, it's hard to say you should hold him for the future. It's a shame, because he's a tooled up hitter with a powerful righty swing (25 homers with a 89.5 MPH EV and 16.9 degree launch in 105 games at Triple-A), and he finally made the hit tool improvement he needed to make, which stuck in his small sample MLB debut. He put up a 19.8/11.0 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 17.4/10.9 K%/BB% in 46 PA in the majors. The 17.9% whiff% is even more impressive. His 76 wRC+ wasn't impressive, but he got unlucky with a .342 xwOBA. He's not a burner with a 27.4 ft/sec sprint (in a small sample, so that might not be his true talent level), but he's a good athlete and he loves to run with 26 steals at Triple-A. He's the type where I would keep a close eye and pounce the second you see him getting at bats, but it's hard to hold until that happens. - 2025 Projection: 22/7/28/.244/.308/.417/8

634) Edouard Julien - MIN, 2B, 25.11 - I poured some cold water on Julien last off-season, writing in his Top 1,000 blurb, "I was the party pooper on a Minnesota infielder last off-season (Jose Miranda), and I’m going to do it again with another Minnesota infielder this year, Edouard Julien. What gives me pause, in 5×5 BA leagues especially, are that his strikeout rates are high (31.4%), his groundball rates are high (50.2%), he’s a below average defensive player, he has below average speed (27 ft/sec sprint), and he struggled majorly vs. lefties (.447 OPS in 48 MLB PA and .758 OPS in 91 PA at Triple-A)." ... All of those deficiencies were on full display in 2024 and it resulted in him losing his job mid-season and getting sent back down to the minors. He got called back up in August, but he was even worse than before. He put up a 80 wRC+ with 8 homers, 6 steals, and a 33.9/11.0 K%/BB%  in 94 games on the season. He still hit the ball hard with a 9.8% Barrel%, and he still walked a ton with a 11% BB%, but that is all he did well. He dug himself a hole to get another shot at a starting job, and it doesn't look like he has one going into 2024. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/42/.231/.327/.413/8

635) Marco Luciano - SFG, SS/2B, 23.7 - Luciano's prospect star has slowly faded as he's continued to climb the ladder, and it came to a head in 2024 with a terrible year in the majors, and also a very mediocre year at Triple-A. He put up a 59 wRC+ with a 34.6/6.2 K%/BB%, 0 homers, and 0 steals in 81 MLB PA. And at AAA he slashed .250/.380/.380 in 83 games. He's not good on defense, the hit tool is below average at best, and he's not fast with average speed. Power was always his main selling point, and that is still present with a plus 73.7 MPH swing and 89.8 MPH EV at Triple-A, but the launch is relatively low, he doesn't particularly pull it a ton, and SF is just a deadly ballpark for power hitters. He's also been passed on the depth chart, so he doesn't have a clear path to playing time at the moment. Without much defensive value, hit tool problems, little speed, no starting job, and good but not great power, I just don't see him as a very unique or valuable player right now. He's still on the radar, he has legit power, and he's young, so I'm not giving up on him completely, but this is as high as I can go. - 2025 Projection: 28/7/24/.234/.310/.400/2 Prime Projection: 68/24/73/.248/.322/437/6

636) Gabriel Rincones - PHI, OF, 24.1 - Rincones is a powerfully built 6'3'', 225 pounds with easy plus power, and in his first shot at the upper minors in 2024, he dominated. He slashed .263/.357/.487 with 11 homers, 20 steals, and a 25.6/11.6 K%/BB% in 59 games at Double-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+. He's not a burner, so don't expect big steal totals in the bigs, but he should at least be a contributor in the category. He's a corner outfielder and there are hit tool issues, but I'll bet on a guy who looks the part, hits the ball hard, disposed of Double-A immediately, and is knocking on the door of the bigs. The biggest issue is that he's terrible vs. lefties, so it might end up in a platoon role. 2025 Projection: 18/5/24/.228/.298/.420/4 Prime Projection: 68/23/75/.245/.323/.462/9

637) Jefferson Rojas - CHC, SS, 19.11 - I was a bit lower on Rojas than consensus last off-season, because I just didn't see big enough tools to get really excited about him for fantasy, and that played out in 2024 with a mediocre season. He hit 6 homers with 21 steals (in 29 attempts) and a 88 wRC+ in 96 games at High-A. We have to grade on a curve because he was young for the level, and the 15.3% K% was excellent, so it's not like it was a terrible year or anything, it just displayed that he's a better real life prospect than a fantasy one. He can play SS and he gets the ball on the ball, which gives him a very high floor, but the power/speed combo projects to be moderate at best. He's a solid fantasy prospect, but not a truly coveted one at the moment. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/17/71/.273/.326/.421/15

638) Jeral Perez - CHW, 2B, 20.5 - Perez getting traded from LA to CHI is a major developmental downgrade, and while it does theoretically create a better path to playing time down the line, I don't think the trade off is worth it. Perez has a lot of development left to go as he's only reached Single-A. Having said that, he's still a really good lower minors prospect. I gave him the Andy Pages 2.0 comp, and that really sums him up pretty well. They are both 6'0'' righties with relatively extreme lift and pull profiles, above average to plus raw power, a plus plate approach, and mid 20 K rates. He slashed .262/.370/.423 with 12 homers, 4 steals, and a 22.9/12.9 K%/BB% in 105 games. Andy Pages set a strong foundation for himself in 2024 to be an above average MLB bat, and Perez has the potential to do the same in a few years. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/22/80/.255/.332/.440/6

639) Luken Baker - STL, 1B, 28.1 - With the news of Contreras moving to 1B, that takes a lot of the wind out of Baker's sails in terms of playing time projections. It doesn't seem like St. Louis is interested in him as anything more than a power bench bat. Which is understandable considering his age and hit tool risk, but it's still unfortunate as far as fantasy goes, because the guy is a home run machine. He hit 33 homers in 84 games at Triple-A in 2023 and then hit another 32 homers in 108 games this year. He smashes the ball with a 91.1 MPH EV and he lifts it with a 17.5 degree launch. He hasn't exactly kicked the door down when he's gotten his small shots in the majors, which is what a bat like this has to do, but the power has most certainly transferred with a 92.3 MPH EV and 16.6 degree launch in 148 career MLB PA. It's come with a .198 BA though, and even though his 22.4% K% this year looks good, the 33% whiff% doesn't look good. He not only hits for power, he walks a ton too with a 14.3% BB% in the majors, so I thought he was worthy of getting a shot at an everyday job, but it's not to be. He'll have to Kool Aid Man the door down, and at 6'4'', 285 pounds, he just might. - 2025 Projection: 31/11/36/.228/.321/.427/0 Prime Projection: 63/20/68/.236/.331/.462/1

640) Jonathon Long - CHI, 1B, 23.2 - I’m a hawk for great pro debuts coming right out of the draft, and Long’s great pro debut in 2023 certainly got my attention. Despite getting picked 266th overall as a college bat (he signed for slot value, so there were no complicating signing bonus factors), I messed around and placed Long on my Top 1,000 Rankings, writing in part, “Long makes for an interesting late round target in deeper leagues … He has a very quick and powerful swing that looks relatively legit to me, and he hits the ball hard. Obviously don’t expect a league winner, but I think he’s a real prospect.” He then went out and proved in 2024 that he is most certainly a legit prospect, to say the least. He slashed .340/.455/.528 with 7 homers and a 16.5/17.5 K%/BB% in 46 games after getting the call to Double-A. He then went to the AFL and obliterated the league with a 1.088 OPS and 6 homers in 18 games. He’s still a mostly 1B prospect (he can play some 3B too) whose reasonable projection is more of a good bat than a great one, so he’s still more of a deeper league guy, but he most certainly backed up that great pro debut. He’s a close to the majors bat who can make a fantasy impact if he can work his way into the lineup. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/20/76/.257/.326/.441/1

641) Jesus Baez - NYM, SS/3B, 20.1 - Baez' season ended on July 3rd after undergoing knee surgery for a torn meniscus, but he has showing off a very impressive hit/power combo before going down with the injury. He cracked 10 homers with a 15.7 degree launch, 16.2% K% and 123 wRC+ in 64 games at Single-A, and then he snuck in 8 games at High-A where he proved everything will transfer with 1 homer, a 15.6% K% and a 119 wRC+. He's not a huge tools guy at 5'10'', but he's powerfully built and he surely has a powerful righty swing with a 89.7 MPH EV. He's not particularly projectable and the plate approach isn't great, so it might be someone who sees his production drop, or maintain, as he gets to higher levels, rather than someone who just keeps on improving. I think a reasonable upside projection for him would be an above average hit/power combo, rather than a truly special one. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 71/24/79/.263/.321/.441/7

642) Pablo Guerrero - TEX, 1B, 18.8 - Pablo Guerrero is Vlad Guerrero's son and Vlad Guerrero's brother. He has the power of a Guerrero with 7 homers and a 119 wRC+ in 51 games in rookie ball, but he doesn't have the contact rates of a Vlad with a 30.0%/8.0% K%/BB%. He closed out the season at Single-A as a barely 18 year old and struggled with a 64 wRC+ and 1 homer in 27 games, but considering his age, I wouldn't put too much stock into that. It's super fun to bet on a Guerrero, and at 6'2'', 200 pounds with the patented Guerrero family swing, he most certainly has a carrying tool in his power. Even with the shaky hit tool, I'm apt to go after him. I think he's a bit underrated, which is hard to believe considering the bloodlines. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 72/28/85/.247/.322/.473/2

643) Connor Wong - BOS, C, 28.10 - Wong had a strong season in 2024, finishing as the 10th best fantasy catcher, and after Boston traded Kyle Teel, he seems secure in his job, at least for the short term. I'm still not a big fan though. He was a well below average defense catcher, and he got lucky on offense with a .330 wOBA vs. .288 xwOBA. His EV bottomed out at 86.5 MPH, he doesn't make a ton of contact with a 28.8% whiff%, and he doesn't get on base with a 5.7% BB%. He just seems like a good backup catcher to me, which is where I think he'll end up in the long run, but for now, he's got the job. - 2025 Projection: 51/11/49/.253/.309/.400/9

644) Hunter Goodman - COL, C/OF, 25.6 - Goodman is not a good defensive catcher, making it more likely that Drew Romo is going to be Colorado's starting catcher of the future, and they don't really have openings in their short term or long term outfield either. I don't know where he fits in, but if he does work his way into playing time, the guy is going to jack dingers. His 74.9 MPH swing is elite, and it resulted in 13 homers in 70 MLB games with a 12.8% Barrel% to back it up. The hit tool and plate approach are atrocious though with a 28.6/3.6 K%/BB%, .190 BA, and .238 OBP. I just don't see him as more than a part time power bat long term, but I'm a sucker for that bat speed, he hits in Coors, and it's conceivable they give him a shot at catcher. - 2025 Projection: 33/10/41/.215/.278/.415/1

645) Adrian Del Castillo - ARI, C, 25.6 - Del Castillo is not a good defensive catcher, and he might be a DH only, which is a major problem in projecting his future playing time. His bat is really going to have to max out, and the good news is that it maxed out in 2024. He utterly obliterated Triple-A with a 144 wRC+, 26 homers, and a 16.9/11.6 K%/BB% in 105 games, and then he utterly obliterated the majors with a 146 wRC+, 4 homers, and a 32.2/8.0 K%/BB% in 25 games. As you can see from that K/BB though, the hit tool is a major risk, and his strikeout rates in the minors prior to this season were very high. The power is plus and he puts the ball in the air, but the hit tool risk combined with the poor defense could be enough to keep him as a bench bat. He's highly unlikely to take the starting catcher job away from Gabriel Moreno anyway, even if he was better on defense. In most leagues, he's probably someone you jump on when/if he does get in the lineup, rather than someone you hold waiting for it. - 2025 Projection: 41/10/47/.245/.312/.423/1

646) Carter Jensen - KCR, C, 21.9 - The unheralded Jensen continued to rake his face off everywhere he's played, and it's high time we start heralding him. He put up a 137 wRC+ in 84 games at High-A, and then he got the call to Double-A where he put up a 112 wRC+ with 8 homers in 41 games. He obliterated the AFL too with a silly 1.382 OPS and 4 homers in 12 games, but granted, I think I could have put up a 1.000+ OPS against AFL pitching this year. He hits the ball very hard, he has no groundball issues, and he can pull it. He's a legit exciting power bat with a howitzer lefty swing, but it comes with legit hit tool risk too. He hit .233 with a 26.5/8.8 K%/BB% when he got to Double-A, and he has a career .235 BA in 373 minor league games. He walks a ton, so add a star in OBP leagues, but the hit tool still needs to take a step forward to be a slam dunk starting MLB catcher. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/22/68/.232/.317/.435/5

647) Triston McKenzie - CLE, RHP, 27.8 - Here is what I wrote about McKenzie after his latest spring outing, "3.2 IP, 7 hits, 2 ER, 0 HR, 3/0 K/BB vs. a Quad-A Cubs lineup. The velocity is still up with a 93.6 MPH fastball, and the whiffs are still coming with a 38% whiff%. He didn't pitch all that well, and the competition wasn't all that great, but McKenzie continues to be an arrow up player this spring. I still don't fully trust him, but he's likely going to bounce back from a disaster last couple of years." 2025 Projection: 8/4.28/1.33/135 in 140 IP

648) Mitch Garver - SEA, C, 34.2 - Garver caught 25 games in 2024, which is a saving grace to his value, because he wouldn't crack the Top 1,000 without catcher eligibility. He had a nightmare of a time hitting in Seattle's extreme pitcher's park, and he'll still be hitting there in 2024, which doesn't give much hope for a truly impactful season. His 89.9/94.8 MPH AVG/FB EV with a 18.3 degree launch shows the power potential is most certainly in here, and he did crack 15 homers in 114 games, but the hit tool fell off a cliff with a 30.9% K% and .172 BA (.180 xBA). Garver has a long track record with a career .236 BA, but the Mariners were the worst park in baseball for righty batting average, so that might not be a complete fluke. He was terrible vs. righties last year with a .549 OPS, so a short side of a platoon bat is his main role, although he'll still get plenty of time vs. righties. He could definitely get enough playing time to be a viable starting catcher in fantasy if the hit tool bounces back, but he's no longer sneaky exciting like he has been in the past. - 2025 Projection: 44/17/53/.225/.316/.424/0

649) Jake Rogers - DET, C, 29.11 - Rogers was the 2nd best defensive catcher in baseball last year, and he was really good in 2023 as well, so I have to think he's still the favorite to get the majority of playing time in Detroit despite a terrible offensive season. He put up a 71 wRC+ with 10 homers and a 29.4/6.5 K%/BB% in 102 games. He's got pop with a 89/94.2 MPH AVG/FB EV and a 15.7 degree launch, but the hit tool is tanking him. Dillon Dingler is right on his tail, so he doesn't have much job security if he continues to be terrible on offense. He's an extremely low end option. - 2025 Projection: 39/13/41/.219/.283/.408/1

650) Jose Miranda - MIN, 3B, 26.9 - 1B is so light this year, and with Miranda seemingly ticketed for a large share of Minnesota's 1B job, I'll make an exception to the 20 GP qualification I'm using and include him in the 1B rankings along with these 3B rankings. He has an average-ish hit/power combo with a 15.4% K%, 88.9 MPH EV, and 15.5 degree launch. It only resulted in 9 homers and a 5.9% Barrel% in 121 games, so that is very lackluster power output for a 1B, especially one who doesn't walk (4.2% BB%). He put up a 115 wRC+, but the .306 xwOBA shows there was good luck in play there. He's not an MLB starter long term, and even short term I'm sure Minnesota is hoping someone can take this job from him. - 2025 Projection: 40/11/48/.262/.312/.418/2 Update: Like I thought, Minnesota brought in a vet to take the job away from Miranda

651) Jose Tena - WAS, 3B, 24.0 - Tena looks to be locked in as Washington's starting 3B, but I'm still treading carefully here. He was terrible vs. lefties in the majors (.458 OPS in 48 PA), he was pretty bad at 3B, he was a bad real life hitter (83 wRC+ in 44 games) and Brady House is almost unquestionably the long term starter there. House already spent a lot of time at Triple-A in 2024, so "long term" could be more like very quickly into 2025. Tena also has bad plate skills with both contact and chase issues (24.4/4.2 K%/BB% in the majors and a 25.2/7.4 K%/BB% at Triple-A). He does two things well though, and those things are good for fantasy, which is hitting the ball very hard (91.2/96.8 MPH AVG/FB EV) and speed (28.1 ft/sec sprint with 6 steals in 44 games in the majors). The launch was low in both the majors and Triple-A, so he can't fully take advantage of that power, and he's been a bad base stealer his entire career, so it's hard to count on him truly racking up steals. I see the appeal, and he'll be cheap, so I get it, but he's not one of my later dart throws. All good if he's one of yours though. It's not like he's very expensive right now anyway. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/55/.245/.302/.401/16 Update: I was already out on Tena, and then Washington signed DeJong to be their shor term 3B while House cooks

652) Abimelec Ortiz - TEX, 1B, 23.1 - I was never the high guy on Ortiz, and I kinda wrote him off after his poor first half of the season, but he redeemed himself in the 2nd half, slashing .308/.406/.570 with 15 homers, 2 steals, and a 21.1/14.2 K%/BB% in his final 60 games. He's 5'10'', 230 pounds with a howitzer of a lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. He's not a good defensive player and he was bad vs. lefties (.623 OPS in 107 PA). Tack on the hit tool risk, and it's still not a player I'm going to be super high on. But there is no doubt power in his bat, so if he does get the playing time, he's going to pop dingers. - 2025 Projection: 9/3/13/.224/.291/.409/0 Prime Projection: 61/21/74/.246/.318/.451/2

653) Chase Davis - STL, OF, 23.3 - The Ghost of Poor Pro Debut Past actually didn't have a bad year at all in 2024, but it wasn't that good either considering all the hype he had after the draft, proving the weight put on the poor debut was the proper evaluation. He slashed .252/.349/.417 with 12 homers, 9 steals, and a 23.8/11.8 K%/BB% in 112 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. He got a cup of coffee in the upper minors to close out the season and put up a 103 wRC+ in 8 games. He still has that smooth and athletic lefty swing, but the raw power has only been above average at best, and it comes with a low launch (47.5% GB%). He doesn't have the hit tool, speed or defensive value to really make up for the power not being standout. It's just not a very unique profile as a good but not great corner outfield bat, and I'm kinda being generous even saying "good" there. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 51/14/53/.251/.325/.423/5

654) Billy Amick - MIN, 3B, 22.5 - Selected 60th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the reason Amick isn't grouped on the FYPD Rankings with the higher end college hitter prospects, and didn't get drafted as highly as that group of hitting prospects either, is because of his 18.2%/9.9% K%/BB% in 65 games in the SEC. That is both too much swing and miss and too much chasing. He can definitely mash with 23 homers and a 1.026 OPS, and he's a proven SEC hitter, so I still like the bat a lot, and he had a strong pro debut to back up the strong college production. He ripped 3 homers with an 88.5 MPH EV and 19.5/15.6 K%/BB% in 18 gamest at Single-A. It came with a .222 BA and 53.2% GB%, so it wasn't all roses, but it was nice to see the strong plate skills. He's a solid but unspectacular power bat. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 72/22/78/.253/.320/.447/5

655) Tommy White - OAK, 3B, 22.1 - Selected 40th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'1'', 228 pound White has that low and wide batting stance which I've always disliked since I started writing, and now it seems like teams and mainstream scouts are also open about not liking. It's all about the upright batting stance into a leg kick these days. He fell to 40th overall despite ripping up the SEC and ACC all 3 years he was in college, hitting 75 homers with a 14.5%/8.2% K%/BB% in 187 games. And his poor pro debut (2 homers with a 67 wRC+ in 25 games at Single-A) did nothing to change the lukewarm attitude I have (and MLB seems to have had) towards him. A poor defensive player with no speed and low walk rates is a recipe for scratching and clawing for playing time. Having said all that, the contact/power combo from a proven major college performer is good enough to take a shot on at this point of the rankings, and while "Oakland" is getting more crowded, you have to think there will be playing time available if he hits. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/22/79/.253/.310/.450/2

656) Blake Burke - MIL, 1B, 21.10 - Burke was selected 34th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, which is relatively high for a DH/1B bat to get drafted, which means Milwaukee really believes in Burke's bat. And why not, as Burke is a 6'3'', 240 pound masher who hit 50 homers in 182 career games in the SEC (20 homers in 72 games this season). He's had hit tool and chase issues throughout his career, but a 14.9/10.8 K%/BB% this year shows he's capable of improvement. He played in only 5 games at High-A in his pro debut for reasons I am unsure of. He didn't hit a homer, but a 22.2/11.1 K%/BB% is a good sign that the hit tool won't blow up in a bad way in pro ball, and we know the power is in there. He's not a good defensive 1B, so there is a ton of pressure on his bat to become more than a part time power hitter, but for fantasy especially, why not take the shot here. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/23/79/.250/.322/456/2

657) Austin Charles - KCR, 3B/SS, 21.4 - Charles was a super raw, super talented project at an uber athletic 6'5'' coming into 2024, and he more or less heads into 2025 with that exact same profile. He was 20 years old and repeating Single-A, which is never a great sign, and while he had a much better season this year with a 121 wRC+, the .257/.353/.386 triple slash with a 25.8% K% and 10 homers in 117 games doesn't exactly look great. You only have to watch him swing the bat once with an insanely athletic, quick, and powerful righty swing to overlook the lackluster statistical profile, and he can certainly lift and pull it with a 35.2% GB% and 60.1% Pull%, so he should be able to get to most of his power down the line. He also has plus speed with 36 steals. The real question is the hit tool, and while it seems the odds are against him hitting enough to be a full time regular, the upside would be considerable if he can figure it out. He continues to hover in that Top 200-ish area for me as a high risk, high reward lotto ticket. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/18/74/.233/.308/.423/19

658) Jhonny Severino - PIT, SS.3B, 20.5 - You only have to watch Severino demolish a homer to completely get his appeal. He's a still projectable 6'2'', 185 pounds with that absolute vicious and athletic righty swing that jacked out 16 homers in 84 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A (6 homers in 28 games at Single-A). He's also a good athlete who stole 16 bags in 20 attempts. He was a 19 year old at rookie ball for his first 56 games of the season, so I was a little skeptical of the 15.9/11.8 K%/BB% at that level, and that skepticism proved correct as he put up a much worse 30.1/6.5 K%/BB% at the more age appropriate Single-A. There is definitely risk with much more refinement needed, but the upside is easy to dream on. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 75/24/82/.242/.313/.448/12

659) Jeremy Rodriguez - NYM, SS, 18.9 - Rodriguez was one of the top high-floor DSL breakouts in 2023, and he remains a high floor prospect after a solid showing in stateside rookie ball, slashing .282/.355/.400 with 3 homers, 17 steals, and a 17.1/9.7 K%/BB% in 50 games. If you want to get a little crazy with the comp, his swing reminds me more than a bit of Francisco Lindor's, and Rodriguez is basically the same size with the same skillset. Lindor's power was also undersold as a prospect. But Lindor is obviously the stupid ceiling comp. You can also find utility infielders with similar profiles and size. You get the point. He gets the bat on the ball, he's 6'0'' with room for muscle, he's a good athlete, and he has a good glove. He's probably a bit underrated right now if anything. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/17/60/.269/.331/.413/20

660) John Gil - ATL, SS/3B, 18.10 - Gil is a pretty toolsy and projectable 6'1'', 175 pounds, and he's now conquered both levels of rookie ball, putting up a 120 wRC+ in 48 games in the DSL in 2023, and then putting up a 124 wRC+ with 3 homers, 26 steals, and a 16.1/13.3 K%/BB% in 51 games at stateside rookie ball in 2024. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 72 wRC+ in 39 games, but he was barely 18 years old, and the 23.3/11.9 K%/BB% with 14 steals wasn't bat at all. There is definitely room to tack on more mass, and he was lifting and pulling in rookie ball, so he should be able to get to most of his eventual raw power. Gil checks a lot of boxes for a rookie ball player with contact, approach, speed, athleticism, good size, and projection. He's a definite legit breakout candidate in 2025. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/16/58/.273/.336/.419/26

661) Luis Pena - MIL, SS/3B/SS, 18.4 - Pena was the top hit/speed combo breakout in the DSL, slashing .393/.457/.583 with 1 homer, 39 steals, and a 8.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 44 games. He's not a big guy at a relatively skinny 5'11'', but he has an explosive righty swing that can hit the ball hard, there is plenty of room to tack on mass, and he doesn't have any major lift and pull problems, so there is definitely potential for him to develop some level of real power down the line. If he can, that makes for a pretty exciting prospect with contact, speed and power. If he can't, there should still be enough impact there for him to be a enticing hit/speed prospect. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 82/15/64/.272/.331/.425/28

662) Jhonny Level - SFG, SS, 18.0 - Level signed for $1 million in last year's international class, and he then went on to decimate the DSL, slashing .275/.393/.517 with 10 homers, 18 steals, and a 16.7/14.0 K%/BB% in 48 games. He doesn't necessarily have the scouts dream body you can really project on to fly him up rankings, but he's a rock solid and athletic 5'10'', which can certainly work. He excelled in all facets of the game, and while there might not be a true standout tool when he gets to higher levels, he very well might have enough juice to stay very productive across the board. I wouldn't stick my neck out too much, but he's definitely one of my favorite DSL breakouts. He's a fun one. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 81/21/79/.268/.332/.437/15

663) Yolfran Castillo - TEX, SS, 18.2 - Castillo obliterated the DSL with a 8.2%/22.7% K%/BB%, 6 steals, and a 188 wRC+ in 20 games before Texas showed how much they liked the kid by calling him up to stateside rookie. He proved the profile will transfer there too with a 10.6% K% and 4 steals in 15 games. He didn't hit a homer this year, but he's a projectable 6'3'' with good bat speed, so more power is certainly coming down the line. He signed for a solid $647,500, and with how quick Texas promoted him, they are tipping their hand as to how much they value him. He has both floor (elite contact rates with a good glove) and upside (size, projection and athleticism). He's definitely a good target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 85/18/71/.278/.343/.428/18

664) Tyler Black - MIL, 1B, 24.8 - Black didn't play a single game at 2B this year, telling me they have given up on playing him at that position, and he only played 9 games at 3B and 12 games in the OF. He spent the majority of his time at 1B and DH. And the bottom line is that low EV 1B/DH don't really exist, especially ones who have a good but not great hit tool. He put up an 83 MPH EV with 0 barrels, a .561 OPS and a 29.8% K% in his 57 PA MLB debut. The EV sat at 85.7 MPH at Triple-A. He also doesn't have the type of extreme lift and pull profile to really pull that off, but it doesn't go in the extreme the other way either, so he can definitely pop some dingers. If he had a viable position, I wouldn't mind the speed, OBP, good BA, some pop profile at all, but he doesn't have a position, and I don't think the upside is high enough to really wait to find out if he can find one. - 2025 Projection: 33/5/24/.245/.306/.383/9 Prime Projection: 77/13/61/.263/.332/.415/24

665) Charles McAdoo - TOR, 3B, 23.1 - McAdoo was a 13th round pick in 2023 who has done nothing but rake in pro ball, slashing .279/.364/.479 with 17 homers, 21 steals, and a 24.7/10.4 K%/BB% in 124 games split between High-A and Double-A. His production was much worse at Double-A than High-A with a .675 OPS in 63 games, which is a bad sign, but that drop off only happened after he was traded to Toronto, so I want to give him some leeway for a major life event (new city, new org, new coaches, etc ...). He's power over hit at a very strong 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful righty swing, and he lifts and pulls a ton. He's not a burner, but he's a good athlete. He's going to have to scratch and claw for playing time, and there is hit tool risk, but there is fantasy upside in here if he gets his shot. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.238/.309/.431/9

666) Dante Nori - PHI, OF, 20.6 - Selected 27th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the first thing that jumps out about Nori is that he's already an old man at 20.6 years old on Opening Day 2024. I thought he was going to need a walker to get to the podium. Being old for your high school class is so 2008, when Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers book came out. These days it's all about being 17 years old. But Philly isn't afraid to take old high schoolers, like they did with Aidan Miller last year, and they went back to that well in 2024 with Nori. Nori might be old, but his tools are undeniable with a built up 5'11'' frame, elite speed, a good feel to hit, a good glove in CF, and above average raw power. His grandfather was an assistant college baseball coach and his father is an assistant coach in the NBA. He has coaches' son in his veins. The profile also mostly transferred to pro ball with 0 homers (55.4% GB%), 4 steals, a 123 wRC+ and 21.2/24.1 K%/BB% in 14 games at Single-A. I'm usually scared off by old high school bats, and they don't get any older than Nori, but I'm intrigued enough by Nori's combination of floor and upside to not get too hung up on it. I like him. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 83/15/62/.264/.332/.418/30

667) Wyatt Sanford - PIT, SS, 19.4 - Selected 47th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Sanford has baseball bloodlines with his dad playing 19 games in the bigs, and like most baseball bloodlines kids, you can tell. He has a plus SS glove with a natural lefty swing, good feel to hit, and plus speed. While the swing is smooth, the stance isn't all that smooth and is geared more for contact than power. The 6'1'', 185 pound frame definitely has room to tack on more mass, but he's not expected to be a big power hitter down the line. There is a nice combination of floor and upside here, but both the floor and upside aren't quite high enough for me to rank higher than this. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/17/70/.268/.331/.4247/25

668) Nelson Rada - LAA, OF, 19.8 - Rada is a tough evaluation as an 18 year old at Double-A, but let's try to parse through the numbers and skillset. The one thing that is for sure is that he has impact speed and baserunning ability. He stole 27 bags in 50 games in the DSL in 2022, 55 bags at Single-A in 2023, and 35 bags in 123 games at Double-A this season. The hit tool and ultimate power projection isn't as easy. He hit .234 with a 23.3% K% this year, but considering how young he was for the level, that can be considered pretty impressive. The only year he was at an age appropriate level, 2022 in the DSL, he hit .311 with a 12.6% K%. As a 17 year old at Single-A he hit .276 with a 18.1% K%. This could easily end up being a plus hit tool at peak with an easy and simple lefty swing. He also has a very strong plate approach with a 11.4% BB% and .331 OBP. He was excellent in that department his entire career. He's a plus CF, so his glove will keep him on the field, and his speed gives him a decent floor for fantasy. It's not hard to see a potent top of the order hitter ... if he can do enough damage when he does make contact. He's had extreme groundball rates his entire career (56.6% this year), he doesn't hit the ball hard, and he's already a decently filled out 5'8''. He's hit just 4 homers in 288 career games and just 1 this season. That says more bottom of the order hitter than top of the order, but considering how young he is, I don't want to rule out a power uptick down the line. If he can just get to 10+ homer power, there is impact top of the order potential in here. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/8/57/.268/.332/.372/25

669) Ryan Johnson - LAA, RHP, 22.8 - Selected 74th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Johnson's delivery is so unique and weird, and not necessarily in a good way, but I think the true uniqueness gives him some extra intrigue to me. Different can add some unknown upside, and while most teams are probably risk averse and shy away from different, I go towards it when it comes at a steep discount. And weirdness is far from the only thing going for Johnson. He has the size, production and elite K/BB to back it up at 6'6'', 215 pounds with a 2.21 ERA and 35.9%/3.3% K%/BB% in 106 IP in Conference USA. The fastball sits 92-95 but can hit the upper 90's and the sweeper is a devastating pitch that he goes to often and racks up whiffs. He also throws a curve and change. If the Rays drafted him, I would feel so confident about naming Johnson a major target, but it's definitely a red flag that he lasted until 74th and got picked by the Angels. I always say you can't be too much of a slave to organization, so I'm not going to let it scare me off too much. I really really really like Johnson as a FYPD sleeper pick. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.95/1.26/165 in 160 IP

670) Jared Thomas - COL, OF/1B, 21.9 - Selected 42nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Thomas gets the Coors bump, and he has enticing fantasy upside, but he also feels like the type of guy that Colorado never really gives a full chance to become a full time player. He performed well in his two years in the Big 12, slashing .349/.435/.635 with 16 homers, 18 steals, and a 20.6%/10.7% K%/BB% in 60 games in 2024. He's 6'2'', 190 pounds with room to tack on some more muscle, and he's a good athlete with above average speed and plus defense at 1B (he also can play CF, again showing off his athleticism). Add a star for being young for the class, and another another star for having a strong pro debut with 2 homers, 1 steal, a 19.4% K% and 146 wRC+ in 8 games at Single-A. 15/15 with 20/20 upside is in the cards here, and the hit tool will get as much help as possible in Coors. I like him relative to his lack of hype. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/71/.254/.325/.428/16

671) Tytus Cissell - ARI, SS, 19.0 - Selected 132nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for $800,000, Cissell was a late riser in the draft process, and sometimes those guys that pop up later in the process can have a lag on their value, which is what Arizona is hoping for after they swiped him in the 4th round. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with an absolutely vicious swing. He's a switch hitter and the swing is smoother from the left, but it's truly vicious from both sides. He's also a plus runner and athlete with a good up the middle glove. The hit tool isn't a lock, but if he manages solid contact rates in pro ball, his stock could fly in a hurry. He's definitely an enticing later round target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/19/72/.250/.322/.427/21

672) JD Dix - ARI, SS, 19.6 - Selected 35th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Dix is a 6'2'', 180 pound SS with a simple and quick swing from both sides of the plate, developing power, and some speed. The hit tool is the most standout tool right now, profiling as a solid across the board type at peak. There really isn't anything too remarkable about his profile. Just your classic really good high school prospect with good size, good feel to hit, and good overall athleticism. He's good. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 79/18/72/.273/.338/.429/16

673) Luis Cova - MIA, OF, 18.2 - Cova was a popular international prospect breakout pick coming into the season, and while he didn't explode into truly coveted prospect territory, he did enough to have his value hold serve in the breakout waiting room. He hit 3 homers with 36 steals and a 10.0/15.3 K%/BB% in 55 games in the DSL. He only hit .239, but that was mostly due to bad BABIP luck, so I'm not too concerned about that considering the contact rates. He's a projectable and athletic 6'2'", so when the power ticks up to combine with the plate skills and speed, that big breakout could be right around the corner. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/18/69/.270/.338/.430/28

674) Cris Rodriguez - DET, OF, 17.2 - Rodriguez has some of the highest pure upside in the class, but he's not quite refined enough to really go after him too hard. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with present power and more coming down the line. He's also a really good athlete with speed. The swing is definitely fast and powerful, but it's not really that natural or smooth, and he's had some hit tool issues. I like him, and he could easily emerge as a Julio Rodriguez type if it really all clicks, but that doesn't seem like the most likely outcome, to say the least. Still a really good upside pick. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 79/26/86/.251/.322/.461/16

675) Dorian Soto - BOS, SS, 17.1 - Soto is the type of international prospect that I love to target. He's not the most hyped guy in his class, but he has that prototypical size at a projectable 6'3'', 185 pounds, and his swing jumps off the screen as uber quick and powerful. He already has big time power and it could end up double plus at peak depending on how he fills out. He's a good athlete but isn't considered a burner, and while he's known to have a solid hit tool and approach, I'm thinking there could be some hit tool risk in here looking at the swing. If he were faster, I might really, really love him, but as is I still really like him as an upside target. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 79/28/88/.250/.322/.469/13

676) Jon Gray - TEX, RHP, 33.5 - There is some talk of moving Gray into the bullpen, and with Texas' closer job wide open right now, that might not be such a bad thing for Gray owners, because he's become a pretty boring, at best, fantasy starter. He put up a 4.47 ERA with a 19.6/6.4 K%/BB% in 102.2 IP. He's become a mostly 2 pitch pitcher (fastball/slider), and only the slider is good. Or more like above average. Moving him to the bullpen is actually the best chance for upside (if he can win the closer job). - 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.30/115 in 130 IP

677) Tyler Mahle - TEX, RHP, 30.6 - Mahle returned from Tommy John surgery in August, looked like crap for 3 outings, and then hit the IL for the rest of the season with a shoulder injury. He underwent the Tommy John in May 2023, so essentially having his entire 2024 season wiped out is normal, but he didn't look good at all. His stuff was way down with a 91.4 MPH fastball, and the slider and splitter didn't miss as many bats as usual. I'm willing to just call it a lost year and give him a redo with a full normal off-season, but it's possible he will just never be the same. Flier territory. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.28/1.31/125 in 130 IP

678) Tony Gonsolin - LAD, RHP, 30.10 - I'm not so sure Gonsolin deserves to crack this list, and I'm not so sure he's a favorite for a rotation spot, but I guess any possible Dodgers starter should at least get a mention. He missed all of 2024 recovering from Tommy John, but he was able to make 3 rehab outings at Triple-A where he looked completely healthy. He was terrible in 2023 before succumbing to the injury, but at his best he has multiple secondaries which can miss bats and put up well above average xwOBA's. Those secondaries weren't there for him in 2023, but they were there in previous years, and they were there in the rehab starts, so he makes this list by the skin of his teeth. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.25/1.30/100 in 120 IP

679) Luis Garcia - HOU, RHP, 28.5 - Garcia underwent Tommy John in May 2023, and after a mid-season setback in 2024, it wiped out his entire 2024 season. He's still expected to start 2025 on the IL, so he's really in pure flier territory. This is why I would be careful about going after the Tommy John discount on everyone. You really want to limit it to the cream of crop if you can. He looked like himself before going down with the injury in 2023, and I always felt he was underrated for fantasy, but with this injury, I'm scared off. Flier only. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.21/1.31/95 in 100 IP

680) Lance McCullers Jr. - HOU, RHP, 31.6 - McCullers missed all of 2023 with an elbow injury that eventually required surgery to repair the flexor tendon in mid June. He experienced renewed elbow soreness in 2024, and that wiped out his 2024 as well. He hasn't pitched since 2022 at this point, and he's expected to start the 2025 season on the IL too. Careful who you buy that "Tommy John" discount on. He's a high K, mid rotation starter at full health, but who knows if he ever gets back to full health. He cracks the list on the off chance he does. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.25/1.31/70 in 70 IP

681) Cristian Javier - HOU, RHP, 28.0 - Javier underwent Tommy John surgery in June which will likely wipe out his entire 2025 season (or maybe just a late season option). He wasn't pitching well before going down with the injury either with a 18.0/12.7 K%/BB% in 34.2 IP. His strikeouts have been on the decline for 2 years now as well, and his stuff just isn't missing enough bats. I really liked Javier last off-season, and I foresaw a K bounce back in 2024, but that is not how it played out. The K's got even worse and then he picked up a very serious arm injury. He's a flier only at this point. - 2025 Projection: OUT

682) Jake Fraley - CIN, OF, 29.10 - Fraley is in a strict side of a platoon role at best, and because he's not a good defensive player, he's at risk of being just a bench bat too. His offense isn't quite good enough to feel comfortable with him being locked into that role with a career 101 wRC+ and a 95 wRC+ in 2024. He gets the bat on the ball with a 18.3% K%, he runs with 20 steals in 116 games, and he gets on base with a .333 career OBP, but he's a guy who should get like 400-500 PA, and in fact he's never gotten more than 382 PA in his career. He simply doesn't hit the ball hard enough with a 84.3 MPH EV. - 2025 Projection: 58/12/47/.255/.333/.401/22

683) Starling Marte - NYM, OF, 36.5 - Marte is in the last year of his deal, the Mets are full go win now mode, he can't stay healthy, and they have a plethora of prospects who are champing at the bit for an opportunity, so I don't think the 36 year old Marte's leash is going to be very long here. He's bad in the outfield now and he's never been a big on base guy. I'm just saying, I can easily see a drop in his age 36 year old season which will land him on the bench. Having said that, he hit .269 with 7 homers and 16 steals in 94 games last year (he hasn't played in more than 120 games since 2019), and the .337 xwOBA was directly in line with his career averages, so he definitely can keep beating those kids off with a stick and hold the job. He's in physical decline with a career worst, below average 27.1 ft/sec sprint, but he could steal bases if he was in a wheelchair. He's not the worst win now flyer, but certainly don't pay up for the name value, especially in dynasty. - 2025 Projection: 69/12/61/.267/.323/.402/24

684) Jacob Young - WSH, OF, 25.8 - Young is a very bad offensive player, but he seems pretty locked into the starting CF (or as locked in as you can be while being this bad offensively) because he's a plus defensive CF and Washington doesn't have any other good options at the moment. He also runs, which makes him relevant for fantasy. He stole 33 bags with a 29.7 ft/sec sprint in 150 games, and that is basically all he does. He can get the bat on the ball with a 19.6% K%, but with a 1.6% Barrel% and 85.8 MPH EV, it still only led to a .648 OPS and .286 xwOBA. He's a 4th outfielder on a team who doesn't seem to have any other options. - 2025 Projection: 58/4/33/.248/.313/.325/21

685) Victor Scott - STL, OF, 24.2 - St. Louis is committed to playing the kids in 2024, and that could mean that Scott gets another extended look in center in 2025. He had a disaster 2024 with a 40 wRC+, 2 homers, 5 steals, and a 27.1/3.9 K%/BB% in 155 PA. The .179/.219/.283 triple-slash is pretty irredeemable, and he was nearly just as bad at Triple-A too with a slash of .210/.294/.303. He has elite speed, and he actually hit the ball decently hard with a 88.4 MPH EV, but his 2024 was so atrocious it's hard to overlook. I'm not betting on a legit bounce back even with the opportunity he seemingly still has in St. Louis, and with a still decent 400 NFBC ADP, he might not even be that cheap either. I see the appeal with his stolen base upside, but he's not one of my fliers. - 2025 Projection: 41/6/33/.228/.287/.346/19

686) Richard Fitts - BOS, RHP, 25.3 - Here is what I wrote about Fitts in the latest Dynasty Rundown: "2.1 IP, 2 hits, 1 ER, 4/3 K/BB vs. a very weak Braves lineup. He now has a 1.42 ERA with a 32.1/14.3 K%/BB% in 6.1 IP. Fitts came into spring a new man with upper 90’s heat and filthy stuff, and that was on display yesterday as well. He was mostly a control over stuff guy coming into this year, but it sure looks like he’s changing that profile into a stuff over control guy now, and for fantasy, that is definitely what we want to see, but he still has to prove he can truly harness the stuff in a starting role. He’s so obviously a major riser this spring, and with Bello starting the year on the IL, there is a rotation spot to be won, so he makes for a great underrated target. I’m just worried with how much hype he’s getting, he’s not actually going to be all that underrated." 2025 Projection: 6/4.33/1.36/108 in 110 IP

687) Cade Povich - BAL, LHP, 25.0 - Povich didn't crack this list originally because I had him as a back end starter without a rotation spot, but he's looked better this spring, and he might have a rotation spot now. Here is what I wrote about him in his latest Rundown update, "3 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 6/1 K/BB vs. Pitt’s Quad-A+Cruz lineup. Not the best competition, but Povich has been absolutely lights out this spring in 5 IP with 0 ER and a 38.9/5.6 K%/BB%. I thought his path to improvement would be increased stuff, as the fastball only sits low 90’s, but it looks like it could come with improved control/command. He has his stuff on an absolute string this spring, and it’s still missing a ton of bats. I was out on Povich, but his spring performance definitely has me regretting that decision." 2025 Projection: 7/4.25/1.32/115 in 120 IP

688) Landen Roupp - SFG, RHP, 26.6 - Seems to possibly be gaining steam for the 5th starter job, although nothing is certain and I'm hoping Birdsong wins it. He throws a 94.4 MPH sinker with a plus curve and a 5 pitch mix. If he had better control, I could see liking him, but he put up a 12% BB% in 50.1 IP in 2024. Probably a low end back guy with mid rotation upside if he can improve his control (and his control has been improved this spring). 2025 Projection: 6/4.15/1.31/119 in 120 IP

689) Drew Thorpe - CHW, RHP, 24.6 - Thorpe had the type of nightmare MLB debut that can shake a dynasty owner to their core, putting up a 13.2/11.1 K%/BB% with a 5.48 ERA in 44.1 MLB IP. He simply doesn't have the type of stuff to just ignore that. His 91 MPH fastball was batting practice for MLB hitters with a 7.7% whiff% and 93.5 MPH EV against. His slider and cutter were bad too. The only good pitch was his unique changeup (really more of a knuckleball) which put up a 37.9% whiff% and .260 xwOBA. He also ended the season on the IL with an elbow injury that required surgery to remove a bone spur. Not the end of the world, but it's something to note. The famed changeup transferring to the bigs gives him a silver lining to the terrible season, but this looks like a low K #4 type upside profile. It's just not enticing for fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.38/1.34/111 in 140 IP

690) Steven Zobac - KCR, RHP, 24.5 - Zobac might be one of the more underrated pitchers in the minors right now as he checks a solid amount of boxes. He certainly looks the part at an athletic 6'3'', 185 pounds. His stuff is good with a low to mid 90's fastball that has a great movement profile and is a bat missing weapon, to go along with an above average slider and solid changeup. And he has plus control over the entire arsenal. The final box is that he has upper minors production too with a 3.25 ERA and 28.6/6.2 K%/BB% in 55.1 IP at Double-A. He wasn't quite as good at High-A with a 3.95 ERA and 20.0/5.2 K%/BB% in 70.2 IP, so I would temper expectations a bit, but there is a lot to like here. He definitely falls into that pitching prospect bucket that I like to take shots in, but Zobac is still probably more for medium to deeper leagues than shallower ones right now. - 2025 Projection: 1/4.30/1.32/35 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.05/1.25/154 in 160 IP

691) Chase Petty - CIN, RHP, 22.0 - Petty was known as a flamethrower in his draft year, throwing mid to upper 90's, but he was more of a low to mid 90's, plus control guy in his pro career prior to this season. He worked on regaining that velocity this off-season, and it worked with him back up into the mid 90's all season. It came at the cost of his control, and he didn't have a particularly great year, but we are watching the development of a very talented, first round high school arm right before our eyes on the professional level. He was a freshly turned 21 in the upper minors all season and put up a 4.20 ERA with a 22.4/10.2 K%/BB% in 137 IP. He racked up innings, he maintained his stuff, and he more than held his own against much older competition. He has an excellent bat missing secondary in his slider, he has a solid change to use against lefties, and the big velocity is back. I'm sure he's going to go back in the lab this off-season to continue to improve and work on his game. He's not a truly coveted pitching prospect, but he's a still a good one. - 2025 Projection: 1/4.44/1.38/38 in 45 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/174 in 170 IP

692) Carson Whisenhunt - SFG, LHP, 24.5 - Whisenhunt struggled at Triple-A with a 5.42 ERA and 28.4/11.3 K%/BB% in 109.2 IP, and considering he's mostly a two pitch guy (with only one of them being legitimately good), the odds of him landing in the bullpen seem quite high at the moment. The two main things he has going for him though are that all of his pitches can miss bats (sinker, change, cutter, slider), and he'll have a great ballpark at his back if he does get a shot in the rotation. Strikeouts and a run suppressing home ballpark could be good enough to make an impact. The changeup is a legit double plus weapon and 93.2 MPH sinker can be asset when it's at it's best, but it wasn't at it's best in 2024. The slider and cutter also show promise as legit 3rd and 4th pitches, so there is a world where everything comes together and Whisenhunt can thrive in the rotation. But I think the most likely world is that he ends up in the bullpen, or as a back end 4-5 IP type guy. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.44/1.38/55 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.33/135 in 140 IP

693) Hunter Barco - PIT, LHP, 24.4 - Barco has been nothing but a strikeout machine at every stop of his career from a freshman in the ACC in 2020, to a 23 year old at Double-A in 2024. He put up a 3.34 ERA with a 30.4/8.7 K%/BB% in 62 IP at High-A, and then he got just a small taste of Double-A (2.25 ERA with a 46.2/0/0 K%/BB% in 4 IP) before his season ended with a lower leg injury in late July. No injury is good, but it's not an arm injury, so I'm not concerned. He throws a low to mid 90's fastball from a deceptive lefty delivery, to go along with a plus slider and a pretty good splitter. He generally attacks zone with average control. He might end up a back end guy, but there is high K mid rotation upside in here too. - 2025 Projection: 1/4.37/1.36/41 in 45 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.29/158 in 150 IP

694) Mike Burrows - PIT, RHP, 25.5 - I've always felt Burrows was underrated, and while he's not the type of pitcher I take the Tommy John discount on, he returned from the surgery in 2024 and showed he was more or less healthy. He put up a 4.06 ERA with a 26.6/8.9 K%/BB% in 37.2 IP at Triple-A. All 4 of his pitches were absolute whiff machines with the 94.4 MPH fastball putting up a decent 21.9% whiff%, the changeup putting up a 49% whiff%, the slider notching a 37.9% whiff%, and the curve putting up a 35.3% whiff%. That is damn impressive. He's also generally had solid control throughout his career. It's probably #4 starter upside, but there are jobs to be won in Pitt's rotation, and I like his profile. He's a deep league target. - 2025 Projection: 4.35/1.35/83 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.02/1.29/140  in 150 IP

695) Jackson Baumeister - TBR, RHP, 22.9 - Baumeister got traded to the Rays and something immediately clicked with his control, putting up a 4.8% BB% in 29 IP with Tampa vs. a 14% BB% in 70.2 IP with Baltimore. The Baltimore sample is bigger, so it's hard to fully trust the control gains, but this wouldn't be the first time a pitcher has seen big control gains with Tampa, and if he can maintain those gains, he's a very exciting pitching prospect. He put up a 1.24 ERA with a 41.9/4.8 K%/BB% with Tampa, showing what he's capable of when he's hitting his spots. The fastball sits low to mid 90's, but it can reach the upper 90's, and it has great shape which makes it a plus pitch that can miss bats. The curve is a beautiful pitch which goes 12 to 6, and he also mixes in a cutter, slider and change. The control gains might not stick, and then he'll end up in the bullpen, but he's worth a shot at this point in the rankings in case they do. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/3.96/1.31/148 in 140 IP

696) Malcolm Moore - TEX, C, 21.8 - This is a very weak class for catchers, and in shallower leagues, you might want to ignore the catcher position completely in this draft. But in medium to dee6per leagues, Moore is your best option if you need a long term catcher. He immediately becomes the best catcher in Texas' system by a long shot, and he could be in the starter mix as soon as 2027 with Jonah Heim hitting free agency after the 2026 season. Texas selected him with the last pick in the first round at 30th overall for his prowess with the bat more than his process behind the plate, which is perfect for fantasy. He's a 6'2'', 215 pound bruiser who has a squared up batting stance that looks more like he's ready the beat the shit out of the pitcher rather than hit a baseball off him. It's kinda intimidating, and he's raked over two years in the Pac 12 with 31 homers and a .958 OPS in 118 games. The plate approach also took a big step forward this year with a 14.3%/18.0% K%/BB%. He's not likely to become a star, but he can become an above average hitting catcher. He didn't have the best pro debut with a 94 wRC+ and 27.9/7.7 K%/BB% in 25 games, but he was thrown right into High-A, and he also jacked 3 dingers, so I have his value as mostly holding steady. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 60/19/71/.247/.319/.433/2

697) Shotaro Morii - OAK, SS/RHP, 18.4 - Morii is the rare Japanese player to come stateside right out of high school, which I think adds some extra intrigue to his profile. He's a two way player with upside on both the mound and at the plate, so it's hard to say where he's going to end up. I'll start with the bat, which I'm pretty damn excited about. He has a vicious lefty swing with quickness, power, and barrel control from a pretty built 6'1'', 180 pound frame. He hit 45 homers in high school. He reminds me a bit of Hideki Matsui if you are looking for a ceiling comp. On the mound he gets up to 95 MPH with a splitter, slider and curve that all need more development. I hope he sticks as a bat, but he has two real paths to be an impact prospect. I'm a fan. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 78/24/83/.268/.333/.445/9

698) Levi Sterling - PIT, RHP, 18.6 - Selected 37th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Sterling is maybe the most "projection" pitcher in the draft. I mean that in the sense that this could be like buying 2025's top high school arm a year early. The last time I said that, I said that about Walter Ford, and Ford has yet to live up to that promise. So the downside is that the projection you are hoping to see never materializes, or doesn't materialize on the timeline that you would like. What gives Sterling that projection is that he was very young for his class at 17 years old at the time of the draft, and he's very projectable at 6'5'', 200 pounds with an athletic righty delivery. If the fastball can tick up from the low 90's into the mid 90's, he has a chance to explode with plus control and 3 legit secondaries in his change, curve, and slider (change is the best secondary). Something like a Logan Gilbert/George Kirby/Bryce Miller would be a dream outcome here. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/4.10/1.25/170 in 170 IP

699) Mike Sirota - LAD, OF, 21.10 - Selected 87th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Sirota was a potential first round pick coming into the season, but instead of having the big junior year breakout, he took a step back. He went from hitting 18 homers his sophomore year to just 7 homers in 51 games in the Colonial Athletic Conference his junior year. The hit tool isn't good enough to see the power take a step back with a 18.8% K%, and considering he's not from a major conference, the profile needed to be pretty bulletproof. But having said that, it could create a buying opportunity for our purposes. He's 6'3'', 188 pounds with plus speed and good raw power. The swing and stance is geared more for average than power, but he's young for the class, and hopefully pro instruction can get the most out of his raw power (I wrote this blurb just minutes before he got traded to the Dodgers, and now you have to feel even better about the Dodgers unlocking his power). He also has an excellent plate approach with a 23% BB%. He's most likely a 4th outfielder, but joining the Dodgers gives him the best chance possible of beating that projection. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/16/57/.246/.319/.418/19

700) Chase Harlan - LAD, 3B, 18.9 - Most of the high school hitting class, except for Morlando and Fountain, are speed over power prospects at the moment, so if you are looking for an upside power bat later in the draft, Harlan is your guy. Selected 98th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Harlan is a 6'3'', 205 pound bruiser putting up some of the best exit velocities in the class. He's also young for the class and will still be 18 years old for half of the 2025 season. If you squint hard enough, you see an Austin Riley clone down the line. And equally as exciting as his profile is that he landed with the Dodgers. If anyone can figure out the best batting stance for him, and get his hit tool to a good enough level for the power to shine, it's the Dodgers. I really like him and he's definitely underrated. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/26/82/.243/.326/.465/5

701) Rodney Green - OAK, OF, 22.0 - Selected 104th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Green is a high risk/high reward college bat, and with Oakland's relative success with a very similar bat in Denzel Clarke, Green could be next in line. Granted, Clarke is both a bigger and better athlete, and he didn't strikeout as much as Green in college, so even Clarke could be a low percentage outcome. Regardless of comps, I like Green a lot at 6'3'', 190 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. And his strong pro debut made me like him even more, slashing .289/.368/.464 with 3 homers, 9 steals, and a 26.1/11.4 K%/BB% in 24 games. He put up a 28% K% his junior year, but he walked a ton, and he cracked 14 homers with 15 steals in 55 games. Seeing the hit tool remain solid at Single-A is a good first step. He lasted to 104th overall, so it's clear most teams don't think he will hit enough (although he did sign for almost $300K above slot at $1 million, so the threat of returning for his senior season also likely contributed to the drop), but if he does, the upside is substantial. He's a good later round upside in fantasy drafts if you don't want to draft a teenager. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/18/69/.228/.310/.423/18

702) Trevor Harrison - TBR, RHP, 19.8 - Harrison was Tampa's 5th round pick in 2023, and he had a very strong pro debut in 2024 with a 3.15 ERA and 29.3/11 K%/BB% in 40 IP at Single-A. He's a big guy at 6'4'', 225 pounds, although the delivery doesn't look particularly athletic to me. He's fastball heavy with a mid 90's fastball, while the slider and changeup need more refinement, but show flashes. It's a strong foundation to work with and you gotta trust Tampa. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.87/1.27/150 in 150 IP

703) Jedixson Paez - BOS, RHP, 21.2 - Paez put up a 29.0/3.1 K%/BB% in 96.2 IP split between Single-A and High-A. K/BB is king for pitching, so that is really all you need to know for Paez to be interesting and on the radar. He has a very fun, super athletic righty delivery and 2 potentially plus secondaries (slider, change). The fastball only sits low 90's, but there is some projection there at a relatively thin 6'1''. If his fastball ticks up, there is very legit explosion potential in here. I like him a ton and is one of my favorite deep pitching sleepers. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.91/1.22/150 in 160 IP

704) Chen-Wei Lin - STL, RHP, 23.4 - Lin is 6'7'' with a pretty athletic righty delivery and nasty stuff. He put up a 2.79 ERA with a 26.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 116 IP at Single-A. The fastball sits 96.4 MPH and he has a diverse pitch mix with multiple bat missing secondaries (change, splitter, slider). He's still a bit on the raw side overall, as evidenced by the fact that he's already 23 and pitched the entire season at Single-A last year. The K/BB rate was good at the level, but it wasn't really off the charts like you would want to see from a 22 year old with nasty stuff. Having said that, dude is a beast with very obvious potential, and he pitched well all season. I like him a lot. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.96/1.28/155 in 160 IP

705) Kendry Rojas - TOR, LHP, 22.5 - Rojas got a decent amount of off-season love in 2024 that I wasn't buying into, and that proved to be a mistake as he leveled up this year at High-A. He had a 2.43 ERA with a 27.0/5.3 K%/BB% in 55.2 IP. He's 6'2'' with an athletic lefty delivery that certainly looks the part. The fastball has ticked up into the low to mid 90's this year which he combines with a plus changeup and good slider. He's a definite candidate to level up again in 2025 if he can stay healthy and build off this season. - ETA 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.06/1.30/150 in 150 IP

706) Dylan Lesko - TBR, RHP, 21.7 - What a disaster. Lesko was coming off Tommy John surgery when he made his pro debut in 2023, so some of the extreme control problems were excused, but it actually got worse in 2024, so it's getting harder and harder to blame rust. He put up a 6.96 ERA with a 19.2/25.6 K%/BB% in 84 IP at High-A. If you thought getting traded to Tampa was going to help, he actually put up an insane 31.1% BB% in 14.1 IP with them, so whatever they tried, clearly didn't work. Just looking at those numbers, even this ranking seems like wishful thinking, but the stuff is still so good, it really does make you want to stay patient. The fastball sits mid to upper 90's, the changeup is his best secondary and it's a nasty pitch that can end up double plus, and the curve is another potentially plus pitch. But he's clearly very far away from putting it all together. He's a high upside lotto ticket right now. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 7/4.16/1.34/150 in 140 IP

707) Justin Verlander - SFG, RHP, 42.1 - The cliff finally came for Verlander in 2024, putting up a 5.48 ERA with a 18.7/6.8 K%/BB% in 90.1 IP. The 3.78 xERA was much better, and obviously SF doesn't think he's washed, but even a good season in 2025 is not going to come with a lot of strikeouts. His legend status gets him on this list, and in SF's ballpark,, he probably does have one more relevant fantasy season in him. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.08/1.26/133 in 150 IP

708) Charlie Morton - BAL, RHP, 41.3 - I feel like it was like 5 years ago when Morton said he was considering retiring to spend more time with his family. Well, fuck his family I guess, as Morton is now in the stage of his career where they are going to have to rip the jersey off him. He's not even that good anymore and he still doesn't want anything to do with his family ;). He put up a 4.19 ERA with a 23.8/9.3 K%/BB% in 165.1 IP. His curve is his only good pitch, but it's only above average now with a 34.2% whiff%. The velocity is on the decline too with a 94.1 MPH fastball. He can still be a solid mid-rotation starter, but that looks about it. - 2025 Projection: 10/4.05/1.31/160 in 160 IP

709) Trevor Williams - WSH, RHP, 32.11 - Williams new sweeper is what makes him interesting. He added it to the arsenal in 2024 (really 2023, but he barely used it) and it was an awesome pitch with a 45.9% whiff%. It resulted in a really good season with a 2.03 ERA and 22.7/6.9 K%/BB% in 66.2 IP. He now goes from 0 good pitches, to one good pitch. It's still likely a not very enticing back end arm, but I don't know, if that sweeper can repeat, there may actually be some impact potential in here. He's kinda a sneaky deep league target. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.09/1.30/118 in 140 IP

710) Clayton Kershaw - LAD, LHP, 37.0 - He was a shell of his former self this year coming off shoulder surgery with a 4.50 ERA and 18.0/6.8 K%/BB% in 30 IP, and he underwent toe and knee surgery this off-season. It seems like a #3/4 type starter is the best we can hope for, and it's not going to be for many innings either. He cracks this list for legend status only. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.79/1.21/76 in 80 IP

711) Dean Kremer - BAL, RHP, 29.3 - Kremer is a back end starter with just enough K upside to get a half decent ranking on this list. He put up a 4.10 ERA with a 22.2/9.2 K%/BB% in 129.2 IP. The 4-seamer and cutter both miss a respectable amount of bats with an around 23% whiff%, and the splitter is a legit weapon with a 36% whiff%. Again, he's just a back end guy, but I can see enough upside to make him a worthy flier. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.11/1.28/134 in 140 IP

712) Andre Pallante  - STL, RHP, 26.6 - Pallante cracks this list because his ability to induce weak contact is quite real after proving it for 3 straight seasons. He put up a 3.3% Barrel% against with a 1.1 degree launch. He has good velocity with a 94.8 MPH sinker, and he has bat missing secondaries in his curve and slider. It resulted in a 3.78 ERA with a 18.5/9.4 K%/BB% in 121.1 IP. That K/BB really made me want to keep him off the list, but keeping the ball on the ground is a skill that can overcome a bad K/BB, so he gets a reluctantly decent rank. - 2025 Projection: 9/3.93/1.32/115 in 140 IP

713) Osvaldo Bido - OAK, RHP, 29.5 - Bido will need to compete for a rotation spot, and I hope he can win one, because he's by far the most interesting starter out of Oakland's fringe group. He had an excellent season in 2024 with a 3.41 ERA, 2.72 xERA, and 24.3/10.0 K%/BB% in 63.1 IP. His 94.8 MPH fastball was a really good pitch with a .288 xwOBA and 28.7% whiff%. His changeup was excellent with a 34.3% whiff% and .171 xwOBA. The slider and cutter both put up above average xwOBA's and he mixes in a sinker too which keeps the ball on the ground with a 2 degree launch. The control was below average, but he hasn't really had any major control issues throughout his career, so I'm not worried there. He's already 29 and I'm not sure the upside is actually all that high, but he has plenty of interesting to traits to buy into. I hope he wins a spot, and I do think he's worth a flier if he does. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.18/1.31/130 in 140 IP

714) Michael McGreevy - STL, RHP, 24.9 - McGreevy's strong MLB debut is what gets him on this list, because his minor league track record isn't very impressive. He put up a 4.02 ERA with a 21.6/6.9 K%/BB% in 150 IP at Triple-A. The fastball only sits low 90's and none of his secondaries miss a ton of bats. It's a back end profile, but I can't ignore his MLB debut. He put up a 1.96 ERA with a 20.9/2.3 K%?BB% in 23 IP. His slider put up a very good 34.5% whiff%, the 92.9 MPH fastball put up an elite 30% whiff% the cutter was an excellent pitch with a .208 xwOBA, his sinker put up a negative 8 degree launch, and his much lesser used curve put up a 50% whiff%. Those pitches didn't perform as well at Triple-A as they did in the majors, so there is definitely some small sample stuff going on, but at the least, the pro debut proved his profile will transfer. He might end up an elite control #3/4, which will definitely play. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.15/1.29/125 in 150 IP

715) David Sandlin - BOS, RHP, 24.1 - Sandlin's 5.34 ERA in 57.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A isn't that impressive, but the 33.2/7.3 K%/BB% is much more indicative of his true talent level. He has high octane stuff with a mid to upper 90's fastball, two variations of a slider that miss bats, and a developing changeup/splitter. He pitched in mostly short outings in 2024, and he's yet to pitch in more than 66.2 IP over the course of a season in pro ball. He's already 24 years old, so it's on the old side to be so far from being fully ramped up. It makes me think that Boston views him more as a bullpen weapon on their ascending team. There is upside, and he for sure could work his way into the rotation at some point, but I'm kinda leaning bullpen arm, at least for the first few years of his career. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.32/48 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.85/1.26/148 in 140 IP

716) Yeremi Cabrera - TEX, OF, 19.9 - Cabrera comes with both hit tool risk and some age to level risk, and he doesn't jump off the screen physically at 5'11'', but what does jump off the screen is his absolutely vicious lefty swing. That thing is made to launch the ball to the moon, and that is exactly what Cabrera did to stateside rookie ball, slashing .301/.348/.571 with 9 homers, 17 steals, and a 20.0/19.0 K%/BB% in 49 games. It was good for a 151 wRC+. He's a bit of a tweener age wise with his birthday smack dab in the middle of baseball season, so while I wouldn't say he was old for the level, he was on the older side, and when he got the call to Single-A, the numbers dropped off hard with 0 homers, a 73 wRC+ and a 29.8% K% in 23 games. It's fair to give him an adjustment period to full season ball, so I don't want to be too hard on him for that. It does underscore the risk in his profile, namely the hit tool risk, but his power/speed combo is legit, and that is what I love to chase in fantasy. He's high risk, high reward. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/21/78/.244/.327/.438/19

717) Andres Valor - MIA, OF, 19.5 - Valor is a tooled up and projectable 6'3'', 180 pounds, and he had has 2nd strong season in rookie ball, slashing .289/.374/.421 with 2 homers, 35 steals, and a 25.1/8.8 K%/BB% in 54 games in stateside rookie ball. It was good for a 119 wRC+. He did basically exactly the same in the DSL in 2023. There is hit tool risk, he still needs to both add more power and tap into that raw power more, and he's only been good but not great in rookie ball, so it's a lotto ticket, but it's a high upside lotto ticket. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/19/71/.245/.317/.423/22

718) Braylin Morel - TEX, OF, 19.2 - Morel has now conquered both levels of rookie ball, cracking 7 homers with a 168 wRC+ in 47 games in the DSL in 2023, and then cracking 7 homers with a 142 wRC+ in 41 games at stateside rookie. He has a powerful righty swing at 6'2'', so the power is legit, and he's a good athlete with 12 steals. The hit tool is still a question though with a 23.6% K%, and he has to prove it in full season ball, but he can get pretty exciting with a good showing in 2025.  - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/22/75/.244/.319/.429/8

719) Walker Martin - SFG, SS, 21.1 - Martin put up a 46.3% K% in 25 games at Single-A after putting up a 37.6% K% in 44 games at rookie ball. As a 20 year old, those K rates are really enough for him to not crack this list, but his talent demands we stay patient for at least one more year. He has a damn smooth, athletic and powerful lefty swing at 6'2'', 188 pounds that most certainly looks the part of a major leaguer. Even with the high strikeout rates, he still performed pretty well with 8 homers, 6 steals, a .391 OBP, and a 108 wRC+ on the season. He was considered a bit more on the raw side when he was drafted, so some of this hit tool risk was expected. He's clearly never going to be an "age to level" guy, but his talent isn't going anywhere, and if he can figure out the hit tool in his mid 20's, there could be a big payoff here. I'm inclined to buy super low, but make sure the price is actually super low. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/23/78/.235/.318/.434/14

720) Elvin Garcia - BAL, SS, 18.2 - Garcia was a talented international prospect who signed for half a million, and then he went out and produced in the DSL, slashing .294/.439/.505 with 1 homer, 12 steals and a 18.0/19.4 K%/BB% in 36 games. It was good for a 154 wRC+. He's a projectable 6'2'' and he didn't have any groundball issues, so the homer power should come in time, which he will combine with a good feel to hit, speed, and a good glove. With a good showing stateside, and with an uptick in power, he might have the highest real life prospect helium upside of anyone in the Baltimore system outside of Mayo, Basallo, and Kjerstad. He's a good later round target if you can handle the risk. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 78/17/71/.266/.325/.421/23

721) Yairo Padilla - STL, SS, 17.9 - Padilla signed for $760,000 in last years international class, so he was certainly a legit prospect, and then he went out in the DSL and played well, slashing .287/.391/.404 with 1 homer, 22 steals, and a 17.9/10.5 K%/BB% in 35 games. He's a smooth operator in all facets of the game at an athletic and projectable 6'0''. More power should definitely be coming down the line, he has a good feel to hit, he has a really good glove at SS and he has speed. He didn't exactly blow the doors off DSL pitching, but he hit well, and he's still only 17 years old. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/17/69/.261/.320/.416/24

722) Sam Aldgheri - LAA, LHP, 23.7 - Aldegheri is likely a back end arm, but he's close to the majors (he's already made his MLB debut), and there is definitely enough in here to give him mid rotation upside. The fastball only sits 92.2 MPH, but it put up a 19.4% whiff% in the majors, which really isn't all that bad considering he was a 22 year old who jumped straight to the majors from Double-A. That tells me the low 90's fastball can definitely play, and he combines that with a plus slider that actually ate up MLB hitters, putting up a .091 xwOBA with a 38.5% whiff%. He also mixed in a below average changeup and below average curve. He wasn't good in the majors with a 4.85 ERA and 14.9/14.9 K%/BB% in 13 IP, but I'm actually impressed with the fastball/slider combo and pitch mix. He was also a K machine in the minors with a 3.59 ERA and 33.5/10.3 K%/BB% in 95.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. His K rate didn't dip in the upper minors, which is a big step. If he didn't have below average control, I might be willing to get really excited for him, but with below average control, I'm leaning a #4 as his reasonable upside. Improving his control, or his third pitch, or his velocity could easily take him up a notch. He's growing on me. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/79 in 85 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.32/151 in 150 IP

723) J.P. Crawford - SEA, SS, 30.2 - While Crawford wasn't able to fully maintain his power breakout from 2023 (19 homers), he actually was able to maintain a large chunk of it, hitting 9 homers in 105 games, which would have put him on pace for the 2nd most homers in his career if he didn't miss time with a fractured finger. His 6.5% Barrel% was also a career high by far. He definitely has grown into more power towards the mid to later stages of his career here. It has come at the cost of some contact though, putting up a 5 year worst 22.6% K% and 20.2% whiff%. His hit tool also bottomed out with a .202 BA, and while some of hit was certainly back luck, not all of it was with a .227 BA. His .245 career BA isn't very good, he still doesn't have more than mid teens power even with the uptick, and he barely runs. Add a star in OBP leagues as he walks a lot, but this is just a very low upside player who might not be a starter for that much longer. - 2025 Projection: 82/14/55/.245/.338/.391/5

724) Orlando Arcia - ATL, SS, 30.8 - Arcia put up a 72 wRC+ with a .218 BA in 157 games, and while some of it was bad luck with a .249 BABIP, the .261 xwOBA and career 78 wRC+ shows it really wasn't all that much of an outlier season. It does strike me as a definite down year, and he should bounce back in 2025, but this is a very low end option with mid teens pop and that is about it. He doesn't hit for a good average, he doesn't run, and he doesn't walk all that much. - 2025 Projection: 69/16/67/.239/.304/.402/2

725) Dylan Moore - SEA, SS/3B/2B/OF, 32.8 - Moore is a heavily used utility player whose most valuable format would be a deeper OBP, daily moves league. There is value in here if you can start him vs. lefites (.762 OPS vs .639 OPS vs. righties). He stole 32 bags in 441 PA, which is where he derives most of his value, and he can also pop some dingers with a 8.8% Barrel% and 22.6 degree launch, leading to 10 homers. The hit tool is brutal with a career .206 BA (.201 in 2024), but the .316 OBP is where he can be decent in OBP leagues. He's currently penciled in at 2B, but he will have some decent competition there (Bliss). Even with a full time job, he's still just a medium to deep league role player. - 2025 Projection: 59/14/48/.210/.315/.396/28

726) Ty France - MIN, 1B, 30.0 - I've been low on France basically every year of his career, and that came to a head in 2024 with Seattle finally pulling the plug on him being their starting 1B, designating him for assignment in July. Cincinnati picked him up out of desperation due to injuries, and even with the biggest ballpark upgrade possible (from Seattle to Cincy), he actually managed to get worse with an 82 wRC+ in 52 games. He has a career .263 BA with 0 speed and about mid teens homers. Not much here even with him landing in Minnesota, but at least he has the opportunity now. - 2025 Projection: 58/13/65/.255/.322/.398/1

727) Yoan Moncada - LAA, 3B, 29.10 - Moncada pulled a rabbit out of his hat and seemingly landed a starting job with the Angels. He missed essentially the entire 2024 season with an abductor strain, and when he's actually been on the field over these last 3 seasons (not often), he just hasn't been very good with a 76 wRC+ in 2022 and a 98 wRC+ in 2023. On the plus side, he has a solid glove at 3B, and he's always hit the ball hard with well above average EV's and barrel rates, so he certainly has a chance to be an about average 3B overall. The fantasy upside is extremely limited with low homer totals, almost no stolen bases, and a mediocre BA for years now, and I'm definitely not interested in buying the decline years here, so even with a job, he's still a super low end option. - 2025 Projection: 62/16/66/.251/.318/.415/3

728) Jonah Heim - TEX, C, 29.9 - Heim had a terrible season with a 70 wRC+ in 131 games, and while the underlying numbers back it up with a .277 xwOBA, the individual components of the underlying numbers were mostly in line with career norms, so he should bounce back in 2025. The 88.5 MPH EV, 14.5 degree launch and 18.3% K% all look good. Having said that, he now has a career .228 BA in 1,768 PA, which is a large enough sample for that to be the expectation moving forward, and he doesn't really have the power to make up for that. Texas also signed Kyle Higashioka, which is a major, major threat to his playing time. I was out on him to begin with, and now I'm way out. - 2025 Projection: 33/10/39/.233/.292/.396/1

729) Luis Campusano - SDP, C, 26.6 - I was low on Campusano last off-season, and then I saw his new batting stance in spring training and couldn't have been more out. He then unsurprisingly went on to have a terrible season with a 83 wRC+, 8 homers, and a 34.2% Hard Hit%. He made a ton of contact with a 13.7% K%, but the lack of impact still resulted in a .227 BA (.242 xBA). He was also a well below average defensive catcher. He lost his starting job in the middle of the season, and while Elias Diaz isn't much of a road block, I'm not sure he can actually pass him. He's a backup unless he improves considerably both offensively and defensively. - 2025 Projection: 31/7/35/.247/.302/.389/0

730) Kyle Higashioka - TEX, C, 34.11 - Higashioka claimed a large share of San Diego's starting catcher job by June, and I was hoping he could find a full time job this off-season, but it looks like he's going to split time with Heim. He has the power to be fantasy relevant with 17 homers, a 10.9% Barrel%, and 20.7 degree launch in 84 games. It comes with a terrible plate approach (28.1/5.7 K%/BB%), but his 25.6% whiff% and 28.1% Chase% isn't bad at all, so that mitigates some of the risk (but not all of it). Lastly he's an above average defensive player, which will help him get on the field, but Heim has been a good defensive catcher in his career as well. Unfortunately, they kind of cancel each other out for me - 2025 Projection: 30/12/40/.222/.276/.421/1

731) Miguel Amaya - CHC, C, 26.1 - Amaya had a shot to lock down Chicago's catcher of the future job, and he couldn't get it done with a 83 wRC+, 8 homers, and 0 steals in 117 games. The underlying numbers look a bit better with a 88.4 MPH EV, 11.1 degree launch, and 17.1% K%, so I do think he can have some decent offensive catcher seasons, but he now has Carson Kelly to compete with short term, and Moises Ballesteros to compete with long term. He was an above average defensive catcher, which gives him a slight leg up on his biggest long term competition, Moises Ballesteros, but Kelly is good on defense too. There is just too much competition here, and Amaya isn't good enough, to really back on him. - 2025 Projection: 28/7/35/.239/.304/.393/0

732) Dillon Dingler - DET, C, 26.6 - Dingler had a monster breakout at Triple-A, slashing .308/.379/.559 with 17 homers, 5 steals, and a 20.3/10.0 K%/BB% in 71 games. The 91 MPH EV with a 18.4 degree launch backs up the breakout, but he was already 25 years old, and he was terrible in the majors with a 37 wRC+ and 35.5/3.4 K%/BB% in 27 games. He graded out as an above average defensive catcher, but he's not as good as Jake Rogers, so the tie will go to Rogers if both of their offensive outputs are close. Dingler is going to have to outhit Rogers to take over the starting job, which is certainly possible, and he has the pop to be fantasy relevant if he does. - 2025 Projection: 27/8/34/.221/.279/.391/1

733) Kris Bryant - COL, OF, 33.3 - Bryant makes this list for name value and track record only. He looks completely washed with a 75 wRC+ in 2023 and a 70 wRC+ in 37 games in 2024. The EV has been in about 85 MPH for 3 years in a row. The bad back killed him. He's expected to be ready for 2025, and he's expected to their starting DH, but this is a last guy on your roster only type. If that. - 2025 Projection: 51/12/56/.245/.320/.398/0

734) David Hamilton - BOS, SS/2B, 27.6 - If I was more certain that Hamilton truly had a stable full time job, I could see liking him a ton for fantasy, but I think Boston views him more as a heavily used utility player, which limits how high I'm willing to go. Kristian Campbell could conceivably win the 2B job out of camp, and Marcelo Mayer is coming soon too. There is just too much competition, and quite frankly, Hamilton just isn't a good enough real life hitter to stave them off. He has a career 85 wRC+ in 113 career MLB games, and he had a 92 wRC+ in 98 games in 2024. He's a solid middle infielder, but he's not so good that his glove is going to truly force him on the field. The last negative is that the hit tool isn't good enough for this type of profile with a .248 BA and 25.2/6.9 K%/BB%. He's a straight demon on the bases with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint and 33 steals (in 98 games), so he can make a fantasy impact in daily moves leagues even without a full time job, and his 5.6% Barrel% isn't bad, so he can pop some dingers too (8 homers), but I just don't see a full time player here long term. - 2025 Projection: 48/8/33/.244/.309/.398/26 Update: Bregman signing seals his fate as a utility, but his stolen base prowess is still fantasy relevant

735) Jose Caballero - TBR, 2B/SS/3B, 28.7 - I was already valuing Caballero as if he was a heavily used utility player, and now with the Kim signing, that is a foregone conclusion. He's terrible on offense with a 83 wRC+, .267 xwOBA, an 83.7 MPH EV and a 27.5/5.6 K%/BB% in 139 games. He's good on defense, but he's not that good to overcome that offense. He's a great base stealer, racking up 44 steals, which is the sole area where he derives his fantasy value. He's a bench role player for deep leagues. - 2025 Projection: 41/7/30/.233/.299/.352/21

736) Paul DeJong - WSH, SS/3B, 31.8 - DeJong shouldn't be a starter, but I could have said that last off-season and he was a starter for a large chunk of the season, so maybe he can once again find a job this off-season. He still accrued only 482 PA by the end of the season, so 400-500 PA is probably a best case scenario. He's a lift and pull and nothing else guy, leading to 24 homers with a 32.4/4.8 K%/BB%. I shouldn't say nothing else, because he also has a very good glove, which is how he found a job last year. If he can do the same in 2024, he'll hit dingers but hurt you everywhere else. - 2025 Projection: 41/16/43/.221/.287/.412/2 Update: Once agin, he found a job with Washington, but he's still a very low end option

737) Josh Smith - TEX, 3B/SS, 27.7 - Smith is a super utility player who optimally doesn't play everyday, but he could be next man up at several positions, so injuries/ineffectiveness could end up forcing him into near everyday at bats like it did in 2024. He's the epitome of a good bench player with a solid glove, a solid plate approach (20.4/7.8 K%/BB%), a solid EV (87.8 MPH EV), and solid speed (27.6 ft/sec sprint). It resulted in a .258 BA with 13 homers and 11 steals. The deeper the league, the more value he would have. - 2025 Projection: 57/12/53/.249/.326/.395/9

738) Chayce McDermott - BAL, RHP, 26.7 - McDermott has always been talented at a very athletic 6'3'', 197 pounds with good stuff and big strikeout numbers, but his control/command has yet to take a step forward in his 4 year professional career with a 13.7% BB% in 100 IP at Triple-A. The stuff is quite good with a bat missing 93.7 MPH fastball, 3 plus, bat missing secondaries (slider, changeup, sweeper) and a solid curve too. It resulted in a 3.78 ERA with a 32.9% K%. Pitchers are notorious for having something click later in their career, so even at 26 years old, I don't think that is too old for a breakout considering the talent is still in here. One other complicating factor is that he went down with a shoulder injury after his July 30th start. He returned for one start at the end of the season where the velocity was down 2 ticks. He was probably just taking it easy, but it does tack on extra risk heading into the off-season. Baltimore has tons of opportunity is their rotation right now, so they have every reason to keep McDermott a starter for as long as possible, and he has the fantasy friendly upside to roster as a proximity arm in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.35/90 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.31/172 in 155 IP

739) Brandon Birdsell - CHC, RHP, 25.0 - Birdsell is certainly in the bucket of pitching prospect I like to shop in that I talked about in the Ben Brown blurb, but his profile reminds me a bit of Adam Mazur's, who burned me this season, so I'm going to stay restrained in my expectations for Birdsell. Like Mazur, he has plus control of a 95 MPH fastball that doesn't have a great movement profile, although Birdsell's fastball missed considerably more bats at Triple-A than Mazur's did. And like Mazur he has an above average slider as his best secondary to go along with a starter's pitch mix. It all resulted in a 3.91 ERA with a 23.5/5.4 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A. Like Mazur, I'm leaning towards more of a #4 starter as a reasonable upside projection for Birdsell. The deeper the league, the more value he has. 2025 Projection: 2/4.36/1.34/56 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.07/1.25/138 in 150 IP

740) Robert Gasser - MIL, LHP, 25.10 - Gasser's MLB debut was a major success with a 2.57 ERA and 14%/0.9% K%/BB% in 28 IP. The 21.6% whiff% was better than the K rate, and his most used pitch, the sweeper, had a strong 34.5% whiff%. He missed plenty of bats in the minors, so the K rate (and walk rate) should have normalized over time, but he didn't have time. He injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery in June 2024 which will knock him out for most or all of 2025. He doesn't have the upside I look for when taking the TJ discount, so he's not a target for me, but he was looking like another underrated Brewers success story before going down with the injury. - 2025 Projection: OUT Prime Projection: 9/4.08/1.30/140 in 150 IP

741) Drue Hackenburg - ATL, RHP, 23.0 - I was very low on Hackenburg this off-season because he wasn't very good in college and because of his below average bloodlines (I say this tongue in cheek as a Penn State and Jets fan living through the Christian Hackenberg years), but he proved the Braves right for picking him in the 2nd round, putting up a 3.07 ERA with a 26.3/11.3 K%/BB% in 129 IP spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He's a built up 6'2'', 220 pounds with mid 90's heat, a diverse pitch mix, and a bat missing secondary in his curve. The control is below average and that curve is really his only standout pitch, so even with him beating my expectations, it's still likely a back end starter with mid-rotation upside. 2025 Projection: 2/4.50/1.41/42 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.09/1.32/145 in 160 IP

742) Blade Tidwell – NYM, RHP, 23.10 - Tidwell looked like he was going full breakout at Double-A with a 2.41 ERA and 29.9/7.5 K%/BB% in 37.1 IP, but the wheels fell off when he got the call to Triple-A, and now everyone hates him. He put up a 5.93 ERA with a 19.8/13.7 K%/BB% in 85 IP. Triple-A was messing around with the automated strikezone and challenge system, so a lot of guys struggled there, but they are also the only level to use the MLB ball, which adds a different dynamic to evaluating pitchers. Quinn Mathews and Brandon Sproat had a similar split between Double-A and Triple-A, but because theirs happened in a small sample at the end of the season, everyone is just ignoring it. Because Tidwell struggled over a longer sample, everyone has completely jumped ship. The stuff was still good at Triple-A with a 94.8 MPH seamer and a plethora of secondaries that missed some bats and induced weak contact. I'm also docking Tidwell much more than Mathews/Sproat, but a part of me is seeing some picking and choosing with these evaluations. I would be careful about giving up on Tidwell so far, or conversely, maybe be careful about crowning Sproat and Mathews. Or maybe a little of both. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.36/1.37/34 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.13/1.31/144 in 150 IP

743) Nolan McLean – NYM, RHP, 23.8 - McLean was an early season breakout at High-A with a 2.57 ERA and 32.1/8.9 K%/BB% in 28 IP, but he wasn't able to fully keep it up when he got the call to Double-A, putting up a 4.19 ERA with a 22.8/9.1 K%/BB% in 81.2 IP. The stuff is really good with a mid 90's fastball and potentially plus slider, and he's relatively inexperienced as a pitcher, so it's not unreasonable to see him struggle in his first taste of the upper minors as he is hitting career highs in IP. We have to see him dominate the upper minors before flying him up the rankings, but he has the potential to do that in 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/4.06/1.29/138 in 150 IP

744) Michael Forret - BAL, RHP, 21.0 - Forret was a 14th round pick in 2023, but when he made his pro debut in 2024, he had already made major strides from his draft year. Most notably, the fastball ticked up into the mid 90's, and it turned him into a beast with a 3.88 ERA and 28.8/10.2 K%/BB% in 99.2 IP at Single-A and High-A. He has the starter's build at 6'3'', the delivery is pretty athletic. He combines the gas with a potentially plus slider and a pretty good changeup. The control is below average and there is more refinement needed all around, but he's the type who could really pop with a good showing in the upper minors. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.27/146 in 150 IP

745) Charlee Soto - MIN, RHP, 19.7 - Soto was a high upside, high signing bonus high school pitcher in the 2023 Draft, and while he didn't explode in 2024, his value held serve. He put up a 3.60 xFIP (5.23 ERA) with a 26.4/10.0 K%/BB% in 74 IP at Single-A. He has 3 potentially plus to double pitches with a mid to upper 90's fastball, a nasty changeup, and a nasty slider. He was young for the class and known to be on the raw side, so the expectation shouldn't have been a breakout in 2024. It might not truly happen in 2025 either, but as long as the stuff remains top shelf, and the production is solid, his value should hold strong. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 11/3.88/1.31/168 in 160 IP

746) Parker Messick - CLE, LHP, 24.5 - Messick is likely a back end arm with a plus changeup, low 90's fastball profile, but him keeping up the production at Double-A is what gets him on this list. He put up a 2.06 ERA with a 32.3/8.0 K%/BB% in 65.2 IP at the level. I still think he's a back end starter, but every higher level he's able to miss bats at that pace is a slightly better chance that he could reach that #4 starter upside, which would make him fantasy relevant. You also have to trust Cleveland. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.18/1.28/141 in 150 IP

747) Matt Wilkinson - CLE, LHP, 22.4 - Wilkinson was a statistical beast in 2024 with a 1.90 ERA and 37.6/8.0 K%/BB% in 118.2 IP split between Single-A and High-A, but it was only the lower minors, and he mostly dominated with an upper 80's to lower 90's fastball, which doesn't seem like a repeatable thing on the MLB level. He also throws a good slider and changeup, so it's not like he has nothing else, but it's super hard for me to bet on this kind of stuff, especially if he hasn't proven it in the upper minors yet. I'm rooting for him, and fat pitchers are always a favorite of mine (David Wells was one of my favorite pitchers growing up), but I can't call Wilkinson an especially sought after pitching prospect for me quite yet. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.21/1.29/138 in 150 IP

748) Boston Bateman - SDP, LHP, 19.7 - Selected 57th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, you know I love me some monster human beings who are good athletes and have some funk in their deliveries. Enter Boston Bateman, who is a 6'8'', 240 pound beast with an athletic lefty delivery that features a pretty high leg kick and deception by almost keeping his back to the hitter. I absolutely love it. The stuff is there too with a low to mid 90's fastball and a filthy curve, to go along with a slider and change. He's far from a finished product, needing continued refinement to his delivery and control/command, but I love the ingredients and will be targeting Bateman everywhere. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 12/3.72/1.28/175 in 170 IP

749) Blake Larson - CHW, LHP, 19.1 - Selected 68th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Larson has that raw, uncut nastiness that I am just drawn to. Of course the White Sox were the team to pick him, they love this profile almost as much as I do. And that profile is a projectable 6'3'', 185 pound lefty with a funky delivery and filthy stuff. The fastball sits low to mid 90's with tailing action, and the slider is a sharp breaker with at least plus potential. He has a developing changeup as well. He is still raw, he needs to improve his control/command and he needs to refine his changeup, but you know this is a profile I love betting on, and I will bet on it again with Larson. Chicago knows what they are doing with these guys too. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.74/1.31/173 in 160 IP

750) Gage Jump - OAK, LHP, 22.0 - Selected 73rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Jump was a pretty hyped high school lefty in the 2021 Draft class, but he decided to go to UCLA where Tommy John surgery essentially wiped out his freshman and sophomore years. He stayed healthy in 2024 though, and he showed why he was such an exciting high school arm with a 3.47 ERA and 29.8/6.5 K%/BB% in 83 IP in the SEC. He throws a low to mid 90's fastball that is a bat missing weapon, along with 2 good breaking balls and a decent, lesser used changeup. He's not a particularly big guy at 6'0'', the delivery seems a bit reliever-ish to me (not to say it can't work in the rotation though), and there is still injury risk, but I don't see why he wouldn't move very quickly through Oakland's farm system, and Oakland is desperate for impact starters, so the opportunity will be there. I think a #4 starter projection is reasonable for him right now. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.03/1.31/140 in 145 IP

751) Yassel Soler - ARI, 3B, 19.2 - Soler's production in rookie ball isn't all that impressive with a 97 wRC+ in the DSL in 2023 and a 105 wRC+ in 53 games at stateside rookie in 2024, but he has a swing/hit/raw power combo that you want to bet on. He has a quick and powerful righty swing from a strong 5'1l'' frame that definitely looks the part. He also makes a ton of contact with a 17.2% K%. He hits the ball on the ground too much (50.3% GB%), so the 6 homers in 55 games isn't impressive, but his hard hit ability still led to a .303/..351/.472 triple-slash. He's a long way off and the upside probably isn't truly huge, but you can easily envision a pretty enticing hit/power combo prospect in a couple years. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/22/76/.262/.319/.436/6

752) Carter Johnson - MIA, SS, 19.1 - Selected 56th overall, Johnson is a safe high school bat with plus hit as his best tool. Watching his super easy and smooth lefty swing reminds me of when I was evaluating Mickey Moniak in his draft year (Moniak went first overall, but I didn't have him even close to 1st overall on my FYPD Rankings). Let's hope he ends up better than Moniak though, whose hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball ... and spoiler alert (I wrote that above blurb before Johnson debuted), the hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball with a .221 BA and a 33.1% K% in 28 games at Single-A. He was thrown into the deep end at Single-A as an 18 year old, so I don't want to overrate that small sample, but considering I got visions of Moniak before the debut, it doesn't add confidence. Then tack on the fact that that he doesn't have a big power/speed combo (although at 6'2'', 180 pounds, the hope is that he can get to average power) and I don't trust the Marlins to develop him at all, it's just not the type of profile I like going after. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/17/68/.270/.325/.421/9

753) Kyle DeBarge - MIN, SS, 21.9 - Selected 33rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, DeBarge gets the little man discount at 5'9'', 175 pounds, and he gets the non major conference discount playing in the Sun Belt Conference, but he's a legitimately electric player with a lot to be excited about. He has an explosive righty swing that jacked out 21 homers in 62 games, he has a potentially plus hit tool with a 10.3% K%, he's got speed with 10 steals, and he's young for the class. I wish he had a better pro debut, because I might have went after him this off-season, but I was a little underwhelmed by the hit tool (.235 BA with a 24.3% K%) and power (1 homer in 26 games at Single-A). He wasn't a great base stealer in college, he didn't walk a ton, and his size does limit his ultimate power projection (0 homers in 25 games in the wood bat Cape Cod league as well), so it might not be a huge upside profile, but maybe I'm falling into the little man trap as well. Minnesota took him 33rd overall for a reason. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/16/69/.261/.321/.414/16

754) David Coronil - SDP, SS, 17.6 - Coronil could sneakily be my favorite international prospect in this SS class. He has that nearly perfect long, lean, and projectable frame at 6'3'', 175 pounds, and he has that smooth and athletic lefty swing that is easy to dream on. If he tacks on more mass while retaining that athleticism, we could be talking about a prototypical hyped prospect here with power, speed and feel to hit. Lastly, he has one of the best SS gloves in the class, which will be a big help to his real life hype. He's definitely one of my top targets in the international class. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 80/20/80/.255/.328/.436/20

755) Braylin Antunez - MIL, OF, 17.4 -  At 6'0'', 194 pounds, Antunez' build, movements and type of athleticism remind me of an NBA point guard. He has present power, he's fast, and he has a good feel to hit. There might not be as much projection as some of the other long and lean builds in this class, but there is some Jasson Dominguez vibes in the sense he might be pretty filled out already, but it's the type of athleticism that he will maintain. Some of these guys could fill out and slow down considerably, while Antunez has already proven he can do both. I like him a lot, and how can you not trust Milwaukee after Chourio and Made. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 89/20/72/.266/.335/.434/28

756) Kenny Fenelon - MIL, OF, 17.6 - If Antunez (ranked above) isn't the next Milwaukee success story, it could be Fenelon. The 6'0'', 180 pound Fenelon might not be a particularly huge guy, but he's absolutely explosive on the field with both power and speed. He has a strong righty swing that already produces big power, and he's a good centerfielder with excellent athleticism. The hit tool has some risk to it, which is why he isn't getting hyped with the top guys in the class, and while I generally like taking shots on like a 6'3'' guy, Fenelon just looks explosive out there.  - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 73/22/77/.247/.318/.439/26

757) Cobb Hightower - SDP, SS, 20.0 - Selected 88th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the pretty skinny 6'0'' Cobb swings a quick righty bat that has some thump behind it already. When he starts to fill out, he can definitely end up with some legitimate power. He's a good athlete with plus run times, he has a good feel to hit, and he has the ability to play up the middle. He was a late riser before the draft and San Diego popped him pretty early despite little pre draft hype, which tells you how much they like him. He's old for the class, and the upside doesn't seem huge, but like San Diego thought, he could be a sneaky pick late in first year player drafts. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/15/63/.262/.320/.415/18

758) Will Warren - NYY, RHP, 25.2 - Warren put up a 10.32 ERA in his 22.2 IP MLB debut, which is hard to find silver linings with, but let's try to find a few. The 4.52 xERA and 26.4/9.1 K%/BB% look much better, and his pitches were missing bats. His 93.8 MPH 4-seamer actually performed excellently with a 24.6% whiff% and .255 xwOBA. His famed sweeper wasn't great, but it still put up a 37.1% whiff%, which tells me better day are ahead, and the underlying numbers on the changeup were really good with a .221 xwOBA and 32% whiff%. Both the changeup and sweeper got massively unlucky, which was the main culprit for the ridiculous ERA. He also throws a sinker and cutter, giving him a diverse pitch mix. He wasn't good at Triple-A either with a 5.91 ERA in 109.2 IP, but again, the 28.0/8.0 K%/BB% looked much better. He's probably a back end starter, but I don't think his 2024 was as bad as it seemed on the surface. Looking at the underlying metrics of the individual pitches actually paints a kinda encouraging picture. He's only a deeper league play right now, but I would hold him in those leagues. 2025 Projection: 7/4.31/1.35/124 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.32/153 in 150 IP Update: Injuries could push him into a starting role and he's looked good this spring

759) Noah Cameron - KCR, LHP, 25.8 - Cameron is probably your classic back end, crafty lefty with a 92.2 MPH fastball that gets decent movement and has some bat missing ability, but it's not one of those low 90's fastballs to get really excited about. It's the plus control and plus changeup that has been befuddling upper minors hitters, and we know that profile can often stall in the majors. Regardless, he's knocking on the door of the bigs, and the upper minors production is certainly there with a 3.08 ERA and 27.8/6.7 K%BB% in 128.2 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A. He also throws a solid curve and cutter, giving him a starter's pitch mix. I wouldn't completely rule out of a mid rotation outcome, but considering his age and stuff, that seems like the very, very high end. 2025 Projection: 2/4.38/1.35/52 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.11/1.28/143 in 160 IP

760) Tyler Kinley - COL, Closer, 34.1 - It looks like Kinley will be the guy in Colorado with Halvorsen having a poor spring. He's a 34 year old coming off 2 straight seasons of 6+ ERA's, which is absolutely wild to have this guy as your best option. He's beyond desperation option, but he does have the back of the bullpen profile, and he's pitching well this spring. 2025 Projection: 3/4.61/1.38/66/25 saves in 63 IP

761) Tony Santillan - CIN, Setup, 28.0 - I don't trust Alexis Diaz at all, which makes me more likely to take some shots on Cincy relievers if I wanted to chase saves. Even if Diaz falters, Santillan doesn't even seem like the favorite for next man up, but he's good enough on his own merits to crack this list. He put up a 3.00 ERA with a 37.7/7.4 K%/BB% in 30 IP. He's not that good as the 30% whiff% doesn't back up the K rate, but a 30% whiff% is still damn good. He does it on the back of an elite 97.2 MPH fastball and a plus slider. He saved 16 games at Triple-A before getting the call to the majors, so there is a chance he emerges. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.50/1.25/80/7 saves in 65 IP

762) Luke Weaver - NYY, Setup, 31.7 - The Yanks brought in Devin Williams, which bumps Weaver out of the closer job. He's next man up though, and he's good enough on his own merits to still get a solid ranking. He went full breakout in 2024, putting up a 2.89 ERA with a 31.1/7.9 K%/BB% in 84 IP. The 95.7 MPH fastball was double plus with a +8 run value and 30% whiff%. The changeup was elite with a .216 xwOBA and 48% whiff%. And he throws a solid cutter too. The Yanks saw qualities they thought they could work with when they acquired him in 2023, and boy oh boy did it work with his stuff taking a huge step forward. The move from a starter to the bullpen also probably naturally played a role. Those very real adjustments give hope that this is mostly sustainable, and not a one year blip. We know how volatile relief pitching can be, but I'm apt to buy the breakout. - 2025 Projection 4/3.36/1.11/79/7 saves in 67 IP

763) Blake Treinen - LAD, Closer Committee, 36.9 - The Dodgers are stacking their pen, but Trienen still might be the best one of them all. He put up a 1.93 ERA with a 30.4/6.0 K%/BB% in 46.2 IP. He returned from shoulder surgery and also a lung issues, and while the stuff was down two ticks to 94.6 MPH, it didn't seem to matter at all. The heavily used sweeper is straight filthy with a .163 xwOBA and 49.2% whiff%. He's 36 years old, and there were some signs of decline in 2024, so some caution is warranted, but the guy is lights out. - 2025 Projection: 4/2.99/1.07/70/5 saves in 60 IP

764) Michael Kopech - LAD, Closer Committee, 28.11 - We've been fighting it for years, but Kopech finally took his rightful place in the back of a bullpen, and he thrived with a 3.46 ERA and 31.5/12.2 K%/BB% in 67.2 IP. He was also much better in LA (1.13 ERA in 24 IP) than he was in Chicago (4.74 ERA), because of course he was. He dominates with an elite, heavily used (78.4% usage) 98.7 MPH fastball that is a bat missing machine with a 34% whiff%. The much lesser used slider and cutter aren't nearly as impressive, but the cutter was a new pitch and was pretty good when he went to it with a .235 xwOBA. With LA bringing in Yates and Scott this off-season, it seems to push Kopech out of the pole position for saves. The well below average control and lack of a great secondary also probably pushes him more into a setup role, but I guess he'll still be in the mix. 2025 Projection: 4/3.45/1.20/80/5 saves in 65 IP

765) Jose A. Ferrer - WSH, Setup, 25.1 - Ferrer is the best lefty in an unsettled bullpen situation, which can often lead to like 8-10 saves, and it's very possible he can emerge as the main guy too. He throws gas with a 97.9 MPH sinker that keeps the ball on the ground, he has a plus slider with a 39.6% whiff%, and he has excellent control with a 4.7% BB%. It all led to a 3.38 ERA in 32 IP, but the reason he isn't ranked higher than this, is because he only put up a 19.4% K%. He missed more bats in the minors, and he has the whiff machine secondary, so he's certainly capable of more, but it's hard to count on it as he uses the sinker well over 50% of the time. I'm kinda back and forth on loving Ferrer and thinking he could be the long term closer there vs. seeing the K rates and the fact he's a lefty giving me some caution. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.43/1.11/51/10 saves in 60 IP Update: Finnegan signing settles Washington's bullpen, but I really like Ferrer, and I want to bet on him in general

766) Tommy Kahnle - DET, Setup, 35.7 - Detroit has a lot of mismatched toys vying for the closer role, and Kahnle is the most traditional of their options. He's struggled to stay on the mound since 2020, not throwing more than 42.2 IP in any of those seasons, but when he's out there, the ERA's have been pristine. He put up a 2.11 ERA with a 25.7/10.6 K%/BB% in 2024. He does it with a heavily used elite changeup and mid 90's heat. If he's healthy, and dealing, he might look the part the most out of any of their options. - 2025 Projection: 2/3.50/1.18/57/7 saves in 50 IP

767) Jesus Tinoco - MIA, Closer Committee, 29.11 - Tinoco closed the season out in September as Miami's closer, and even though he was a mid-season waiver wire pickup (I'm talking real life waiver wire, not fantasy waiver wire ... well, I guess fantasy waiver too), I kinda like him the most out of Miami's current options, but your guess is as good as mine. He has closer stuff with a 96.1 MPH sinker that keeps the ball on the ground (5 degree launch) to go along with an at least plus slider that put up a .192 xwOBA and a 37.6% whiff%. It led to a 3.32 ERA, 3.32 xERA, and a 25.9/7.4 K%/BB% in 40.2 IP. He doesn't have a long track with a mediocre at best minor league career (hence the part where he was waiver wire fodder), so this type of reliever is very volatile, but at the same time, tons of good relievers pop up like this "out of nowhere." He's a very low end option, but I might take some very late shots for saves needy teams - 2025 Projection: 3/3.51/1.19/63/20 saves in 60 IP

768) Calvin Faucher - MIA, Closer Committee, 29.6 - Faucher was locking in the closer role with 6 saves in August, but he hit the IL with a shoulder problem in September which ended his season, and it allowed Jesus Tinoco get some hooks into the closer role. I have no idea who will be favored for the role in 2025, but Faucher had a 1.40 WHIP with an 11.1% BB%, so I'm kinda feeling Tinoco more. Facuher had a good season with a 3.19 ERA and 26.8% K% in 53.2 IP. None of his pitches are dominant, but the cutter is good, and the sinker and sweeper are solid pitches too. He's just not a good enough reliever to rank him too highly when it's questionable if he even has the role or not. I don't think he's one of my late draft saves targets. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.98/1.34/62/15 saves in 60 IP

769) Kirby Yates - LAD, Closer Committee, 38.0 - I don't have the slightest clue how LA's bullpen is going to shake out, but I guess Yates has as good a chance as any to emerge as the man. He's 38 years old but he's coming off an elite season with a 1.17 ERA and 35.9/11.8 K%/BB% in 61.2 IP, and the Dodgers just paid him $13 million, so they surely think he can at least come close to repeating that in 2025. He's 38 and he has tons of competition, but my gut is kinda saying he could be the main righty when the smoke clears. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.28/1.18/78/10 saves in 60 IP Update: LA announced that Scott has the bulk of the job, and LA has other good righties in their pen to compete with Yates for any righty save opps too

770) Adrian Morejon - SDP, Setup, 26.1 - Morejon went through a few iterations as a target for me. Once as a really exciting starting pitcher prospect back in 2018, and once as an exciting bullpen to starter transition candidate back in 2022. And now in 2025, I thought he could be setup to make that transition back to the rotation, but San Diego announced they need him more in the bullpen, so that dream is mostly dead. Who knows what can happen during the season though. Morejon excelled out of the bullpen in 2024 with a 2.83 ERA and 26.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 63.2 IP. The sinker sat 97.4 MPH and put up a negative 6 degree launch. The slider was double plus with a 39.9% whiff%. The 96.9 MPH 4-seamer put up a very good 25% whiff%, and the new split finger was devasting when he went to it with a 52.9% whiff% and .100 xwOBA, but he only went to it 7.6% of time. He pitched well against both lefties and righties. As I mentioned, he came up through the system as a starter, and looking San Diego's rotation, I don't see why they wouldn't at least give it a shot in spring, but it doesn't seem to be in the cards right now. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.40/1.22/75/3 saves in 65 IP

771) Seth Halvorsen - COL, Closer Committee, 25.1 - It seems Halvosen is the best bet for the closer job in Colorado, but that isn't locked in yet. He had a great MLB debut with a 1.46 ERA and 28.3/4.3 K%/BB% in 12.1 IP. The 99.9 MPH fastball was a plus pitch with a .240 xwOBA and 25% whiff%, and he combines that with a bat missing splitter and slider. That is a pretty classic back end of the bullpen profile. He wasn't as good at Triple-A as he was in the majors with a 4.47 ERA and 28.6/11.7 K%/BB% in 44.1 IP, so I would be careful about buying the small sample MLB debut too hard, but Colorado doesn't have any better options, and at only 25, he very well could lock in this role for several years. The upside is there too. I actually don't mind him despite pitching in Coors. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.83/1.30/65/10 saves in 60 IP Update: He's looked bad in spring, which is not going to win him that job

772) Leonardo Bernal - STL, C, 21.2 - The 6 foot, 245 pound Bernal is a switch hitting catcher with a pretty vicious lefty swing that can definitely do damage. The righty swing ain't bad either, and he continued to put up very good offensive numbers in 2024. He put up a 120 wRC+ with 10 homers and a 22.8/9.7 K%/BB% in 96 games at High-A. He struggled in a small taste at Double-A with a 68 wRC+ in 14 games, but the 16.4/10.9 K%/BB% shows he was far from overmatched. He's also a pretty good defensive catcher. Bernal is a very solid catcher prospect who is probably on the underrated side, although he projects as more of a solid around hitter rather than a true beast. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/17/72/.258/.327/.421/3

773) Creed Willems - BAL, C/1B, 21.10 - Willems isn't a good defensive player, he chases a lot, and there is hit tool risk, so playing time is always going to be an issue, but if he does get his bat in the lineup, he's going to hit dingers. He has plus raw power and he gets to all of it with very high flyball rates, jacking out 13 homers in 82 games at High-A and 4 homers in 16 games at Double-A. It's a good sign that his K% didn't explode at Double-A with a 18.8% K% (20.9/10.7 K%/BB% at High-A), although it came with a 2.9% BB%. He's almost certainly going to need a trade to find a full time job, so he should be solid trade bait at the deadline. And if he ends up on a team who needs a power bat, Willems could fill that role. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/22/75/.238/.312/.441/2

774) Johanfran Garcia - BOS, C, 20.4 - Garcia's season ended after just 14 games after undergoing knee surgery, but they were an impressive 14 games, slashing .385/.467/.596 with 2 homers and a 25.0/10.0 K%/BB%. He was a relatively high priced international signing in 2022 ($850,000), and he played very well his first year in stateside rookie ball, slashing .302/.408/.497 with 5 homers, 3 steals, and a 20.7%/10.6% K%/BB% in 42 games. He’s already pretty physically mature at a muscular and beefy 5’10”, and he unsurprisingly hits the ball relatively hard with a blink of an eye righty swing. If not for the injury, he could have really blown up in 2024, just like his brother, Jhostynxon, did. He's not a lock to stick behind the plate, which does complicate his future projection a bit, but assuming full health, I'm expecting his hype to start percolating in 2025. - ETA: Prime Projection:  64/20/72/.253/.325/.438/3

775) Edgleen Perez - NYY, C, 18.10 - Perez isn't my typical big game power upside catcher that I like to go after, especially if you're in rookie ball, but his supporting skills are good enough to get excited. His plate skills are elite for his age with a 16.2/20.8 K%/BB%, and it resulted in a 138 wRC+ in 51 games at stateside rookie ball. It only came with 2 homers due to a 51.7% GB%, but he hits the ball hard, so there is more game power in the tank if he can raise his launch. And he has a chance to be a good defensive catcher, so his glove could get his bat in the lineup. Ivan Herrera is my favorite dynasty catcher target this off-season, and Perez could develop a similar profile down the line. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/15/68/.276/.343/.430/3

776) Jacob Stallings - COL, C, 35.3 - Stallings resigned with Colorado, which gets him on this list, but there is no guarantee he even holds the job for the entire year. At some point you have to think they are going to go with the kids. But he actually had a good year last year with them with a .263 BA, 9 homers, and a 114 wRC+ in 82 games. He got massively lucky with a .353 wOBA vs. .318 xwOBA, but I'm just Coors helped, and even that xwOBA isn't bad. He's as low end as it gets. - 2025 Projection: 38/9/42/,238/.315/.398/0

777) Freddy Fermin - KCR, C, 29.10 - With Perez getting only 91 games behind the plate in 2024, Fermin was able to amass 368 PA, but that's not quite enough to really make him a starting fantasy catcher because there isn't much upside on offense. He put up a .279 xwOBA with a 89.2 MPH FB EV. He can get the bat on the ball with a 17.9% K%, and his 88.2 MPH AVG EV is better than the FB EV, but there is really not enough here for anything other than a deep league bench bat right now. - 2025 Projection: 30/6/30/.259/.311/.390/2

778) LaMonte Wade - SFG, 1B, 31.3 - Wade is a strong side of a platoon bat. He hit .260 with 8 homers, 45 Runs and 34 RBI in 401 PA. He still put up a very good .354 xwOBA on the back of a 22.4/15.5 K%/BB%, so there are no signs of decline quite yet. He's a deep league, daily moves option only really, and add a star in OBP leagues. - 2025 Projection: 56/14/48/.255/.350/.410/2

779) Kyle Karros - COL, 3B, 22.8 - Karros cuts an impressive figure at an athletic looking, Kris Bryant-like 6'5'', 220 pounds, and he had an excellent season at High-A, slashing .311/.390/.485 with 15 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.8/10.0 K%/BB% in 123 games. He was a 5th round pick in 2023, but he was young for his college class, and there could be some late bloomer traits with it taking a bit longer to get his swing down pat with long levers. He's gone through multiple batting stances and it still doesn't exactly look comfortable to me. He's never hit a ton of homers even in college with more of a line drive, all fields approach, but clearly there is more in the tank in a perfect world. It's not a perfect world though, and I'm not sure Colorado is going to be the team to get the most out of him. Interesting prospect, but he's going to have to prove it in the upper minors before I get too excited. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 59/16/69/.244/.311/.408/5

780) Jack Brannigan - PIT, 3B/SS, 24.1 - Brannigan was a 23 year old at Single-A who had a .238 BA with a 26.1% K%. Odds are the hit tool isn't going to be good enough to be an MLB starter, bit if he can make real improvements to the hit tool, the upside is high enough for him to make an impact. Think something like a Luke Raley type career arc, where he breaks out when he's in his late 20's, but you're still not quite sure if he truly has a lock on a full time job. And like Raley, Brannigan has that type of power/speed combo with 18 homers and 12 steals in 77 games. He can lift and pull, he can hit the ball hard, he's a good athlete, and he has a decent infield glove too. He fits nicely into that reasonably priced, high upside bucket of prospect where you don't have to wait 5 years to see what you have. You will know pretty quickly into 2025 once he hits the upper minors. I'm kinda liking him the more I'm thinking about him during this blurb, but the odds are still that he won't hit enough, a la Joey Wiemer. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.228/.311/.431/9

781) Brant Hurter - DET, LHP, 26.7 - Hurter doesn't seem to have a rotation spot, he's already 26 years old, and the upside isn't that high, so it's hard to really stick your neck out for him, but he had a pretty exciting MLB debut which would have made him an intriguing sleeper if he had a spot. He put up  a 2.58 ERA with a 21.7/3.4 K%/BB% in 45.1 IP. The control is elite, he has a bat missing secondary in his sweeper (37% whiff%), and all 4 of his pitches put up impressive xwOBA's (from .148 to .263). He very well might be one of Detroit's 5 best starters, and if that's true, I'm sure he'll make his way into the rotation eventually. But without a current spot, it's hard to go higher than this. - 2025 Projection: 6/3.98/1.26/86 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.82/1.23/133 in 150 IP

782) Jonathan Cannon CHW, RHP, 24.8 - Chicago really forces you to scrape the bottom of the barrel when looking for interesting players, but at the same time, a team like this gives opportunity to fringy young players who just might be able to take advantage of it. While I don't think Cannon is a good breakout candidate, he has a job, and he has some skills that make him interesting for deeper leagues. He put together a solid rookie season with a 4.49 ERA, 4.37 xERA, and 17.4/7.7 K%/BB% in 124.1 IP. He throws a 5 pitch mix, and while none of them were standout, none of them were too bad either. His 93.3 MPH sinker keeps the ball on the ground with a 6 degree launch, his 94.3 MPH 4-seamer put up a 25.2% whiff% and .273 xwOBA (he should probably throw this pitch more), and his changeup and sweeper were both decent with a .290 and .269 xwOBA, respectively. He also throws a useful cutter. Average control of an average-ish 5 pitch mix can certainly lead to an average starter, and at only 24 years old, there is plenty of tinkering he can do to his pitches and the mix. He's not someone I'm going after and he would have to fall right in my lap, but there are worse fliers in deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.30/130 in 150 IP

783) Robby Snelling - MIA, LHP, 21.4 - Snelling simply wasn't even close to backing up his truly spectacular 2023 in 2024. He put up a 5.54 ERA with a 22.6/8.8 K%/BB% in 115.1 IP at mostly Double-A. And he doesn't have the type of stuff to overlook the poor numbers with a pretty average at best 4 pitch mix. The fastball and sinker sit 93 MPH, the slider is solid and the changeup is still developing. He's a bull on the mound at an athletic 6'3'', 210 pounds, and this is 2nd straight year of staying healthy and racking up innings. He was also heating up in the 2nd half with a 3.64 ERA and 28.3/7.7 K%/BB% in his final 54.1 IP, showing that great 2023 was not a complete mirage. If you combine both seasons, he has a 3.58 ERA with a 233/79 K/BB in 219 IP, and you have to take into account that he was a 20 year old in the upper minors all season this year. It's a workhorse #4 type profile right now, but coming into his age 21 year old season, I think there is upside in here for more with continued refinement. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.53/1.38/40 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.16/1.32/152 in 165 IP

784) Alex Clemmey - WAS, LHP, 19.8 - I've been a sucker for a funky lefty delivery since the days of Josh Hader being one of the very first sleeper posts I've ever written back in 2015/16, and when you combine that with nasty stuff, it has all the makings of an upside pitching prospect that is worth taking the extra risk on. Clemmey is a projectable 6'6'' with a mid 90's fastball, a nasty, bat missing breaking ball, and a developing changeup that led to a 31.5% K% in 92.1 IP at Single-A. The 16.1% BB%, 4.58 ERA, and 1.41 WHIP aren't nearly as impressive, and shows there is a long way to go with a lot of risk for him to reach his high K, mid rotation starter upside, but like with Hader, Clemmey has a soft landing spot as a potentially impact high leverage reliever as well. He was also 18 years old for most of the season, so him being raw was the expectation. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/3.91/1.34/180 in 150 IP

785) KC Hunt - MIL, RHP, 24.9 - Hunt was a big breakout in 2024 after a pretty bad college career, and while age doesn't matter as much for pitching prospects as it does for hitting prospects, I think it's important to note he will already be 24/25 during the 2025 season. He obliterated the lower minors in 2024, and while he couldn't keep it up fully at Double-A, he was still damn good in Double-A with a 2.20 ERA and 29.8/6.9 K%/BB% in 32.2 IP. He dominated with above average control of a plus slider, but his other pitches aren't as impressive. The fastball sits low to mid 90's and he also mixed in a curve and changeup. He was mostly a reliever in college, and there is still reliever risk long term. We've seen Milwaukee work magic with these types consistently, so I don't want to doubt them, and Hunt's statistical season was outstanding, but I don't know, my heart just isn't in him. I get the appeal, but he's not really one of my guys. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/3.91/1.28/135 in 130 IP

786) Cooper Hjerpe - STL, LHP, 24.0 - Hjerpe was proving the profile was going to transfer to Double-A with a 3.07 ERA and 35.1%/14.0% K%/BB% in 14.2 IP, but his season ended after July 2nd with an elbow injury. The walk rate is too high considering the fastball is only low 90's at best, but I still love the funky lefty delivery, and I love to see the K rates stick in the upper minors. A high K, mid rotation starter is definitely in play, if not a high end outcome. Unfortunately the injury now adds unknown risk to an already risky profile. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.04/1.31/159 in 150 IP

787) Joey Oakie - CLE, RHP, 18.11 - Selected 84th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'3'', 205 pound Oakie is a sidearming righty with stuff that dashes and dives in every direction. The fastball sits low to mid 90's with tons of movement, the slider is a vicious pitch with at least plus potential, and he also has a developing changeup. The stuff is almost too nasty for his own good in that he doesn't seem to always know where it is going, so he will need to refine his control/command to remain a starter, but I love me a funky righty (Zander Mueth last year), and I like Oakie a ton this year. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.88/1.33/175 in 160 IP

788) Braylon Doughty - CLE, RHP, 19.4 -  Selected 36th overall in the 2025 MLB Draft, Doughty is a short righty at 6'0'', 196 pounds with a very easy and athletic delivery. He only throws low to mid 90's, and he isn't that projectable, but he can break off some absolutely nasty sliders and curves. The delivery also seems conducive to potentially plus control down the line. You gotta trust Cleveland when it comes to pitcher development, and while this doesn't seem like the highest upside arm, he has some of the best and crispest breaking stuff in the class. Adding more velocity and/or improving his control/command to plus or better can make him a legitimate impact starter. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.09/1.29/146 in 150 IP

789) Jairo Iriarte - CHW, RHP, 23.4 - Iriarte had a super exciting breakout in 2023, but he wasn't able to back it up in 2024. He put up a 3.71 ERA with a 22.8/10.7 K%/BB% in 126 IP. The stuff backed up a tick or two, and the performance backed up with it. The fastball sits about 94 MPH and it wasn't able to miss many bats. It put up a 4.8% whiff% in his 6 IP MLB debut. The slider misses bats (47.1% whiff% in that small MLB sample), and he throws a lesser used changeup which can be an average pitch. Chicago's rotation is horrific, so they have every reason to stick with Iriarte in the rotation, but it's not a special profile. It's a back end profile with mid-rotation upside, which can say about tons of pitching prospects. And it might be a bullpen profile on a team who had a real rotation. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.54/1.41/82 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.24/1.33/135 in 150 IP

790) Michael Kennedy - CLE, LHP, 20.4 - Kennedy is my attempt to be less of a velocity snob. His fastball sat only 89.8 MPH at Single-A, which makes me want to put him in a back end starter bucket and call it day, but I'm fighting that urge. He has the secondary skills to not get too caught up on the velocity. He put up a 3.66 ERA with a 27.8/5.6 K%/BB% in 83.2 IP split between Single-A and High-A. The fastball may not be fast, but it can miss bats, and the changeup and slider are both good pitches which can miss bats and induce weak contact. Tack on plus control, and this is a profile that can actually work as a mid rotation fantasy starter. It's also a good sign the Cleveland targeted him in the Spencer Horwitz trade. I'm kinda liking him, but I wouldn't get too crazy. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.82/1.24/137 in 150 IP

791) Drew Romo - COL, C, 23.7 - Romo was always destined to be Colorado's catcher of the future, for better or worse, and as of right now, it looks like he might fulfill that destiny in 2025. The problem is that he isn't very good offensively. He hit .297 with 14 homers and a 17.8/4.3 K%/BB% in 85 games at Triple-A, which is good on the surface, but it only resulted in a 104 wRC+ to give you an idea of the offensive environment, and more importantly, the 85.2 MPH EV is very unimpressive. He then got a taste of the majors where he was atrocious in 53 PA. He put up a 9 wRC+ with an 82.2 MPH EV and 34.0%/3.8% K%/BB%. Hitting in Coors could make him useful in some of his peak years, but even Coors isn't enough to save this profile. He's going to have to hit the ball a lot harder to make a real impact. - 2025 Projection: 31/5/34/.232/.281/.358/1 Prime Projection: 50/13/57/.256/.309/.394/4

792) Dominic Keegan - TBR, C, 24.8 - Keegan was my favorite very deep league catcher target last off-season, and he now looks one step closer to claiming Tampa's catcher of the future job. He made his upper minors debut in 2024 and didn't blink with a 138 wRC+, 9 homers, and a 20.4/11.3 K%/BB% in 104 games. His upside isn't huge as he's more of a complete hitter than one who sells out for power, but he's got more raw power in the tank if he ever decides to try to unleash it. He's not known as a particularly great defender, but he's improving, and Tampa's Catcher depth chart is horrendous, even after the Danny Jansen signing, so beggars can't be choosers. He remains a very deep league target for me. - 2025 Projection: 18/4/22/.237/.296/.368/0 Prime Projection: 55/14/61/.252/.327/.420/1

793) Jake Bloss - TOR, RHP, 23.10 - Bloss is your classic likely back end starter with mid rotation upside. These guys are more valuable in real life than fantasy, but if they hit their ceiling, they have good fantasy value. His heavily used 93.4 MPH fastball has a good movement profile, and while it got destroyed in his 11.2 IP MLB debut, leading to a 6.94 ERA and 20.0/5.5 K%/BB%, it was an above average pitch at Triple-A. He throws a diverse 5 pitch mix, and his sweeper stands out the most as a bat missing weapon in both the majors (44.4% whiff%) and AAA (38.5% whiff%). None of his pitches are really standout though, and his control has been average to below average throughout his career. He wasn't all that great in the minors either with a 23.3/9.5 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP. He's just not a particularly enticing fantasy prospect right now. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.51/1.38/50 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.29/1.32/130 in 150 IP

794) Adam Mazur - MIA, RHP, 23.11 - Mazur had the type of rough MLB debut that makes you want to just give up on a player. He put up a 7.49 ERA with a 13.9/13.3 K%/BB% in 33.2 IP. And quite frankly, there are no silver linings. None of his pitches were good. The fastball in particular got destroyed. The slider was the only pitch to perform halfway decently. And worst of all, his elite control from the minors was nowhere to be found, probably because he didn't want to throw the ball over the plate with how easily his stuff was getting crushed. He didn't only get hit up in the majors, he also didn't pitch well at Triple-A with a 6.20 ERA in 61 IP, although at least it came with a 60/13 K/BB. Plus control of a 94.6 MPH fastball with a diverse pitch mix and an above average slider is a good profile in theory, but in practice, it's clearly not working. The fastball is way too hittable despite the good velocity. He looks like a back end arm right now. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.50/1.41/64 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 6/4.21/1.34/112 in 130 IP

795) Kohl Drake - TEX, LHP, 24.8 - I was skeptical that Drake's extreme High-A success would translate to the upper minors, because he was dominating by just pumping his low to mid 90's fastball in there, and like I thought, upper minors hitters were able to get to him. His K%/BB% dropped from 33.9/6.5 at High-A to 24.4/13.4 in 20.1 IP at Double-A. But just because I knew not to buy into the High-A numbers doesn't mean I don't like him as a prospect. He's a 6'5'' lefty with good control over a good fastball and good curveball, to go along with a changeup and slider as well. It's probably a #4 upside type, but there is definitely mid rotation upside in here too. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.16/1.31/141 in 150 IP

796) Nate Dohm - NYM, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 82nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Dohm looks like a nice little college sleeper arm right now with his budding 3rd year breakout cut way short with a forearm strain. But he returned in May with his stuff all the way back, and the results were back to full form in shorter outings as well. He dominated in the innings he did pitch on the season with a 1.23 ERA and 32.7%/3.5% K%/BB% in 29.1 IP. He's a big boy at 6'4'', 210 pounds, and he has legit stuff with mid 90's heat, a nasty breaking ball, and a changeup which flashes nasty. He fills up the zone as well. The injury adds risk, but it also tanked Dohm's value to almost non existent levels. He might even be a sleeper for 30 teamers, and I see legit impact potential in here. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.03/1.30/146 in 150 IP

797) Hunter Renfroe - KCR, OF, 33.2 - Renfroe had his 2nd straight season of a 92 wRC+, and at 33 years old and being a poor defensive player, he probably shouldn't be a starter anymore, but KC doesn't have many options. The 75.2 MPH swing is still elite, and the 19.8% K% was a career best, so it doesn't seem like he's washed quite yet, but this is still a very low end win now piece. And while there isn't a ton of good competition there, he still does have some competition. - 2025 Projection: 51/18/58/.238/.306/.431/1

798) Jake Meyers - HOU, OF, 28.10 - Meyers has a plus CF glove, and with how terrible Houston's outfield is right now, that is probably good enough for him to be a favorite for a near everyday job. He's really bad on offense with a career 87 wRC+ in 1,117 career PA, and while you can pull out some positives (a 6.8% Barrel% with an 88.2 MPH EV ain't terrible), the sample is large enough to know he's just not good on offense. And the profile isn't fantasy friendly either with only 11 steals in 148 games despite a 28.9 ft/sec sprint. Full time job or not, he's just not a very good option. - 2025 Projection: 59/15/67/.231/.302/.398/12

799) Jose Siri - NYM, OF, 29.8 - Siri seems to be the Mets starting CF at the moment, but I doubt it's a true everyday job, and the off-season isn't over. He's a plus defender in CF with a fun power/speed combo (18 homers and 14 steals in 130 games in 2024), but the hit tool is just brutal (.187 BA with a 37.9/6.9 K%/BB%). He's optimally a 4th outfielder at best. - 2025 Projection: 54/17/50/.215/.268/.406/14

800) Eloy Jimenez - TBR, OF, 28.4 - Jimenez signed a minor league deal with Tampa, which tells you where his value is, but Tampa's DH job is open (Aranda is penciled in right now), and he still smashes the ball with a 92 MPH EV. That is all he does though. He's one of the slowest players in baseball, the launch is low, and the plate skills are below average. - 2025 Projection: 41/12/49/.255/.309/.428/1

801) Davis Schneider - TOR, 2B/OF, 26.2 - Schnedier wasn't able to back up his impressive rookie season. His hit tool tanked with a .191 BA and 31.7% K%. He played a solid 2B, but there isn't much defensive value there either. The poor sophomore season now puts him in a battle with sooooooo many similarly talented fringy type players in Toronto. The thing that keeps him ranked even this high is that he still put up an excellent 12% Barrel%, so the power potential is in here if he can improve the hit tool. The 21.4 degree launch with a 88.6/93.1 MPH FB/EV ensure he will hit dingers, but it also looks like a recipe for an extremely low BA. I was all for taking a shot on Schneider coming off his excellent rookie season, but it didn't really pan out. He's a bench bat who could be useful if he works his way into a full time job, but that isn't a very unique profile. - 2025 Projection: 41/13/44/.221/.312/.416/5

802) Will Wagner - TOR, 2B, 26.8 - Wagner is smack dab in the middle of Toronto's fringy young player clusterf*ck, and while his excellent plate approach and strong MLB debut could put him in the pole position for playing time, he just doesn't have the type of profile I like rostering. He put up a 125 wRC+ in his 24 game MLB debut, but it came with 2 homers and 0 steals. He swings a slow bat (68.9 MPH), he's slow himself (26.4 ft/sec sprint), and he doesn't hit the ball all that hard (88.1 MPH EV with a 4.4% Barrel% at Triple-A). He had a 90.6 MPH EV with a 9.1% Barrel% in the majors, but the AAA numbers were the bigger sample. The hit tool and approach are the calling card (10.4/16.6 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 18.6% K% and .305 BA in the majors), but as you guys already know well, this isn't my type of player. He's a fine 2B, so it's not like his glove is really going to force the issue either. He's a bench infielder long term, and even if he does get a full time job, the upside isn't worth it. - 2025 Projection: 35/6/35/.275/.323/.407/3

803) Brendan Rodgers - HOU, 2B, 28.8 - Rodgers cracks this list almost purely on his past hype, combined with the fact that maybe once he gets out of Colorado, and actually gets into a real organization (we'll see where he lands, if anywhere), maybe there is some kind of untapped upside in here that a good team can pull out. He still hits the ball hard with a 44.1% Hard Hit%, but that is all he does well at this point. He has no speed, below average plate skills, and a below average launch. I guess the thing a good team will try to do is to get him to hit the ball in the air more, and at this point in his career, why not give it a shot. What does he have lose? Let's see where or if he lands somewhere. - 2025 Projection: 60/14/60/.261/.311/.410/1 Update: He landed with a real organization, and obviously the first thing they are trying with him is to add loft. Just a flier still

804) Alexander Canario - NYM, OF, 24.11 - I was always visually amazed when watching Canario swing, writing, "he swings the bat like it’s a bazooka with an extreme all or nothing approach," in last year's Top 1,000 writeup, and now with bat speed tracking, we saw Canario put up an eye poppingly elite 78 MPH swing. It was in a small sample (40 swings), but that was 4th best in all of baseball. My eyes certainly weren't deceiving me, and it's what keeps Canario interesting to me for fantasy. He's going to rip dingers if he gets playing time, like he did at Triple-A with 18 homers and a 16.8% Barrel% in 64 games. He also keeps producing in the majors in small samples (despite an extremely high K%) with a 148 wRC+ in 17 PA in 2023 and a 128 wRC+ in 28 PA in 2024. The swing is on the long side and he strikes out a ton (30.4% K% at Triple-A), so the batting average is a major risk, and it may prevent him from ever really truly locking down a full time job, but that power upside is big enough to crack this list. 2025 Projection: 28/10/37/.223/.301/.438/2 Prime Projection: 64/25/78/.235/.314/.469/6

805) Mike Boeve - MIL, 1B/2B/3B, 22.11 - Boeve is a better real life prospect than fantasy prospect with a solid hit tool and lackluster power/speed combo, but with Milwaukee's 3B job open right now, being a good real life hitter could get him into that lineup. I like Brock Wilken to take the job based on pedigree and upside, but just because I like that, doesn't mean it's going to happen. Boeve proved his hit tool will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .306/.374/.447 with 6 homers, 1 steal, and a 17.0/9.3 K%/BB% in 66 games. He has some raw power, but the launch is low and it's a line drive approach, so there isn't big homer upside, and he doesn't run much. He's not a small guy at a thick 6'1'', so it's possible for him to tap into more game power down the line. This isn't a profile I love buying into, but with the current opening at 3B, I can't ignore the possibility that he could hit his way into the role pretty quickly. - 2025 Projection: 23/5/27/.249/.300/.385/1 Prime Projection: 68/15/65/.269/.326/.418/4

806) Carlos Santana - CLE, 1B, 39.0 - Santana hit 23 homers with a 114 wRC+ in 150 games in 2024, so even at 39 years old, it's not surprising that he found a full time job. The underlying numbers back up that he's still good with an 89.2 MPH EV, 16.1 degree launch, .330 xwOBA, and 16.7/10.9 K%/BB%. The cliff could come at any moment, and Cleveland has good young players who can take his spot, so this is an extremely low end option still. - 2025 Projection: 65/20/69/.235/.318/.417/3

807) Jesse Winker - NYM, OF, 31.7 - Winker returned from the dead in 2024 (118 wRC+) after a horrific 2023 (66 wRC+), but he tailed off after getting traded to the Mets, and he's likely in line for a platoon role at the very best. The biggest mystery is the 14 steals in 145 games after never having stolen more than 1 bag in a season. The new stolen base rules have created some truly wonky steal seasons. He stole 0 bags in 44 games with the Mets though, and it seems unlikely he even comes close to 14 again. A plus plate approach is his best offensive skill with a 20.9/12.4 K%/BB%, and he's more of a good all around hitter than a home run hitter, so a low upside platoon bat is just not a very enticing profile. - 2025 Projection: 55/14/50/.249/.350/.410/5

808) Mike Yastrzemski - SFG, OF, 34.7 - Yas is a mostly strong side of a platoon power bat who is likely nearing the end of his career. He'll pop dingers with a 10.5% Barrel%, 90.4 MPH EV, and 19.1 degree launch, but it's coming with a low BA (he hasn't hit better than .233 in 5 years), little speed (3 steals), and not many RBI/Runs (60/57). - 2025 Projection: 58/16/54/.230/.311/.438/3

809) Isiah Kiner Falefa - PIT\, 2B/3B/SS, 30.0 - Falefa seems to be penciled in as Pitt's SS at the moment, which is not optimal for them. He's a very low end option with an above average glove and below average bat. The below average bat part is what he care about the most for fantasy with a .283 xwOBA in 2024, and he's never put up higher than a .294 xwOBA in his career. He will run a bit with mid teens stolen base ability, making him relevant in medium to deeper leagues if he really can hold onto this job by Opening Day, but I have a hard time believing he is going to be a full time starter at SS all season. - 2025 Projection: 62/8/46/.262/.308/.362/14

810) Ernie Clement - TOR, 3B/SS, 29.0 - There are things to like about Clement, and he has a path to plenty of at bats, but he's really best suited for a utility role. He's already 29 years old and the upside just isn't there for fantasy even if he does have a full time job. The things to like are that he has an above average infield glove, he has elite contact rates with a 9.1% K%, he can lift and pull, and he has speed with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in a .263 BA with 12 homers and 12 steals in 452 PA. That is definitely a serviceable across the board profile if given full time at bats. But it's not the type of player, especially considering his age, where you want him to be a full time starter. He put up a .282 xwOBA, .297 wOBA, a 85.5 MPH EV and 2.4% BB%. It's a light hitting bottom of the order bat that optimally gets 400-500 PA a season, which is what he got in 2024. - 2025 Projection: 58/14/61/.265/.304/.401/13

811) Tommy Pham - PIT, OF, 37.1 - Pham is 37 years old and coming off a season where he put up a 91 wRC+ and negative 0.1 WAR in 116 games, so kinda wild that he found a full time job, but he seems to have found a full time job.. To Pitt's credit, his .319 xwOBA and 90.4 MPH EV seems to indicate there is still juice left in here, but he's always underperformed his xwOBA, so I wouldn't bank on that too hard. Pitt does have some other options, maybe not perfect options, but I have to think at some point they will prefer to go with the kids. - 2025 Projection: 51/10/39/.246/.318/.400/10

812) J.D. Martinez - FRA, OF, 37.7 - Martinez is 37 years old coming off a mediocre season where he put up a .725 OPS in 120 games. The 14.9% Barrel%, .351 xwOBA and 91 MPH EV are all still good though, so it's possible he lands a near full time DH job, but we'll see. - 2025 Projection: 48/15/61/.247/.319/.438/0

813) Andrew McCutchen - PIT, OF, 38.6 - The 38 year old McCutchen is aging gracefully with 20 homers and a 105 wRC+ in 120 games, but make no mistake, he's aging. The speed is now below average, and he only nabbed 3 bags last year. The 25.8% K% was a career worst, and it led to a .232 BA. He can be useful in deeper leagues, and also in OBP leagues, but he's not going to make a major impact assuming he stays at this level, and at 38, there is no guarantee he stays at this level. - 2025 Projection: 62/16/50/.240/.330/.410/5

814) DJ LeMahieu - NYY, 1B/3B, 36.9 - LeMahieu is a 36 year old coming off a season where he just put up a 52 wRC+ in 67 games. He put up a 99 wRC+ the year before. Not to be Mr. Obvious, but I would say the decline has arrived. The underlying numbers have declined right along with the surface stats with a .299 xwOBA in 2024. He still gets the bat on the ball with a 15.4% K%, and the 5.8% Barrel% isn't terrible, so he can still be a solid part time player. The Yanks 3B job is also currently open, so there is a still a path to plenty of at bats right now. - 2025 Projection: 51/8/42/.250/.328/.385/2

815) Mitch Haniger - SEA, OF, 34.3 - Haniger is nearing the end of his career with a 71 wRC+ in 2023 and a 85 wRC+ in 2024, but he seems to be inline for a large share of the DH job in 2025, and he still hits the ball hard with a 90.6 MPH EV and 9% Barrel%. Super low end win now option for deep leagues only. - 2025 Projection: 44/14/48/.221/.300/.409/1

816) Jeff McNeil - NYM, 2B/OF, 33.0 - McNeil is on his last legs, and while the Mets could go with the vet at 2B, they have so many other good younger options (Acuna, Mauricio, Jett), I just doubt he holds onto the starting job for long even if he does win it. He just had his 2nd straight year of a well below average xwOBA, and he's now 33 years old. He can get the bat on the ball with a 14.4% K% and he plays a solid 2B, but that is about all he does well. He's a desperation option. - 2025 Projection: 44/8/35/.261/.323/.390/5

817) David Fry - CLE, C/1B/OF, 29.4 - Fry underwent surgery to repair a ligament in his elbow in early November with a 6-8 month timeline. That puts May as his earliest possible return date, and it could go into the 2nd half. That doesn't give him much of a shot to lock in a starting job, or at least a near everyday utility job. He's not a good defensive player, so he was always going to have to prove it every step of the way, and this surgery just seems like a terrible roadblock considering he's already 29 years old. The swing speed is below average, and the 90.3 MPH FB EV is also lackluster. He has 505 career MLB PA with a 124 wRC+, but some of that was luck with a career .341 wOBA vs. a .326 xwOBA. I was already torn on if he could truly be a full time player, and with the injury, it has me leaning towards mostly needing to see him healthy and raking again before truly placing a high value on him. - 2025 Projection: 34/8/38/.252/.330/.426/2

818) Kyle Stowers - MIA, OF, 27.3 - I really liked Stowers a few years ago as a power hitting, proximity play prospect. With a plus 73.7 MPH swing that is also very short at 6.8 feet, and with an above average 28.2 ft/sec sprint at 6'2'', 215 pounds, I'm happy that I wasn't hallucinating his very real talent, but the hit tool is just awful. He put up a 36.1% whiff% with a 35.4% K%. And it hasn't improved in 3 years in the majors. It led to a 67 wRC+ in 69 games, which is just horrific. The big power is for sure there with a 91 MPH EV and 10.0% Barrel%, but at this point, you just can't bet on that hit tool. He'll battle for at bats in 2025 with a path to playing time, so he's not the worst flier ever, but that is all he is. - 2025 Projection: 48/15/57/.221/.298/.421/3

819) Richie Palacios - TBR, 2B/OF, 27.11 - Palacios is likely locked into a bench role, and a strong side of a platoon role at best, but he just put up a .325 xwOBA with 19 steals, a .346 OBP and zero contact issues in 316 PA, so he's kinda interesting. He's always had excellent plate skills, and that continued in the majors with a 21.2/14.2 K%/BB%. He doesn't have a ton of pop with a 3.5% Barrel% and 5 homers, but it's not nothing, and he's a good baserunner, going 19 for 20. Tampa isn't exactly super deep, so injuries or underperformance from their starters, combined with Palacios hitting well, could result in a bunch of at bats for him and fantasy relevance. - 2025 Projection: 57/9/41/.248/.337/.385/17

820) Leody Taveras - TEX, OF, 26.7 - Leody looks to be out of a starting job after the Joc Pederson signing, and quite frankly, that is where he belongs. He's a 4th outfielder with average CF defense and a below average bat. He put up a 82 wRC+ in 2024 and he has a 85 career wRC+ in 1,743 PA. He actually doesn't do anything too poorly offensively with almost average underlying marks everywhere you look, but this is a case where the sum is less than the parts. And the sample is big enough to say that this is who he is. It's possible he can level up in his late 20's, but you can say that about a ton of guys, and he currently doesn't have a starting job. - 2025 Projection: 48/11/41/.254/.313/.400/19

821) Mike Siani - STL, OF, 25.9 - The Cardinals are super weak at CF, and it doesn't seem like they are interested in adding vets at the moment, so Scott and Siani will battle it out for the job. Both are really bad on offense, and neither are likely starters long term, but they both have the stolen base upside to be fantasy relevant if they are in the lineup. Siani stole 24 bags in 334 MLB PA, and he did that with a .285 OBP. The guy runs. The 84.4 MPH EV, .243 xwOBA, and 27.5/6.3 K%/BB% shows there really isn't much hope for him to actually be a long term starter, but I guess he deserves to be on the list. He's great on defense, so that could give him the edge for the job. - 2025 Projection: 49/3/25/.230/.295/.323/22

822) Johan Rojas - PHI, OF, 24.8 - The Phillies have Marsh penciled in at CF right now, and he's not a good CF, so it's possible Rojas' plus CF glove gets him on the field. I just doubt it's going to be full time, and Justin Crawford has already been mentioned as an option in 2025, so it will be short lived for Rojas no matter what. He's just not good on offense 85.7 MPH EV, .250 xwOBA, and 19.0/3.6 K%/BB% in 363 PA. He stole 25 bags, so that is what keeps him fantasy relevant if he does get in the lineup. - 2025 Projection: 45/4/30/.250/.293/.340/23

823) Jorge Mateo - BAL, 2B, 29.10 - Mateo's season ended in mid July with an elbow injury that eventually needed an internal brace procedure and flexor repair surgery. The injury is likely to keep him out into the beginning of 2025 as well. He's just a utility player these days, and even if injuries hit, there is no guarantee he's in line for full time at bats as Baltimore is pretty deep. If he does find his way into the lineup, his elite speed and base stealing ability will keep him relevant, and he has decent pop, but it comes with terrible plate skills. - 2025 Projection: 42/6/27/.228/.276/.378/22

824) Darell Hernaiz - OAK, 3B/SS, 23.8 - There are rumors Max Muncy could be considered for the 3B job, which tells me that Oakland optimally sees Hernaiz as a utility infielder long term with Muncy, Wilson, and Gelof as the starters, but just because that's the plan, doesn't mean it's going to work out that way. And Hernaiz is good enough to keep the pressure on all 3 of those guys, slashing .333/.376/.493 with 5 homers, 6 steals, and a 14.0/7.6 K%/BB% in 35 games at Triple-A. He struggled hard in the majors with a 50 wRC+, but a 20.0/8.1 K%/BB% with a 87.1 MPH EV isn't that bad. The launch is low and the 27.5 ft/sec sprint is slightly above average, so we aren't talking about a big talent here, but the guy can hit. If he does find himself with full time at bats, he could put up average across the board numbers. - 2025 Projection: 21/3/18/.248/.291/.353/6 Prime Projection: 68/12/51/.266/.324/.388/11

825) Alejandro Osuna - TEX, OF, 22.6 - I've comped Osuna to pre-roids Melky Cabrera for a few years now, and in 2024, he's getting closer to the roids version of Melky. He slashed .292/.362/.507 with 18 homers, 17 steals, and a 23.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 102 games split between High-A (132 wRC+ in 45 games) and Double-A (151 wRC+ in 57 games). He's not a big guy at 5'9'', and while he can lift it and hit it fairly hard, he doesn't pull it a ton, and he doesn't project for big homer totals on the MLB level. The K/BB rates weren't exactly great and he's not a great base stealer (17 for 23 this year). He's a good ballplayer, and I see the appeal, but he's not really one of my guys. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/17/66/.261/.322/.420/14

826) Kahlil Watson - CLE, 2B/OF, 22.0 - Cleveland selecting Bazzana first overall is an absolute killer for Watson's path to playing time, but the biggest killer to his path to playing time is the hit tool. He just put up a 30.7% K% with a .220 BA in 96 games at Double-A. He was only 21 years old, so there is some age to level leeway you can give him, and he still put up a 104 wRC+, so he wasn't bad. The electric power/speed combo that made him a hyped high school prospect is still here with 16 homers and 15 steals. Even with the hit tool risk, I still like him for fantasy, but he has to get on the field in order to help us. And it just doesn't seem like a team is going to hand him a full time job anytime soon. This could shape up to be more of a mid to late 20's type breakout scenario. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/20/71/.233/.316/.425/15

827) Luis Guanipa - ATL, OF, 19.4 - Guanipa was one of the top breakout targets from the 2023 international class, and while he's yet to truly explode, he remains a very enticing high upside option. He played well in the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 2 homers, 4 steals, a 12.3% K% and 112 wRC+ in 20 games, but he struggled hard when he got the ball to Single-A with a 42 wRC+ in 32 games. The 25.7/8.1 K%/BB% shows he wasn't completely lost, and at only 18 years old with very little pro experience, I wouldn't kill him too much for struggling there. Plus speed and potentially plus CF defense are his best two attributes right now, and he's starting to lock in at least a pretty good feel for contact. Contact, defense and speed is a pretty safe profile that also has fantasy upside. How much power he gets to is the ultimate question, and while he's an explosive player, he's not a big guy and he hit the ball on the ground a decent amount this year. He wasn't that to the moon prospect we hoped for, but there is still a nice little combination of floor and upside in here. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/16/66/.265/.325/.416/24

828) Yohandy Morales - WAS, 1B/3B, 23.6 - The Nationals are really weak organizationally at corner infield, and they selected Morales pretty high at 40th overall, so he's in the right situation to get as much opportunity as he can handle. And he's done nothing but produce in pro ball, putting up a 119 wRC+ in 69 games at Double-A this year. It only came with 5 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.5% K%, so it was more underwhelming than the wRC+ would lead you to believe, but still. He's a big guy at 6'3'', 225 pounds with big raw power. He's not as finished of a product as you would hope for a college bat, needing to improve his game power and hit tool, but there is power potential in here, and there is a long term path to playing time. - 2025 Projection: 16/3/18/.221/.289/.377/1 Prime Projection: 68/17/74/.244/.312/.414/5

829) Cayden Wallace - WAS, 3B, 23.7 - If Tena stumbles, and House isn't ready, Wallace could slide right into that 3B job so easily in 2025. He's a good defensive 3B and he can get the bat on the ball, so if the higher upside, flashier options fail, the safe and stable Wallace could look mighty enticing. He put up a 17.8/7.3 K%/BB% in 56 games at mostly Double-A, and while he didn't perform that well with a 96 wRC+, 3 homers and 4 steals (in 8 attempts), he was playing much better before an oblique injury, followed by a trade to the Nationals, and then followed by a broken rib interrupted his season. It's a mostly low launch, all fields approach, and while he can nab a few bags, he doesn't have big speed, so even if he can find full time at bats, it's a low upside fantasy profile. - 2025 Projection: 16/2/19/.236/.288/.372/2 Prime Projection: 51/13/56/.255/.317/.414/7

830) Gino Groover - ARI, 3B, 22.11 - Low upside college bats aren't exactly my favorite targets, but Groover played to the very top of that profile in 2024, and after keeping it up at Double-A to close out the season, he definitely has my attention. He cracked 3 homers with a 16.4/9.1 K%/BB% in 13 games at the level. This coming off a strong showing at High-A with 7 homers, 3 steals, a 13.7/11.4 K%/BB% and 129 wRC+ in 40 games. I'm still not seeing huge fantasy upside as he doesn't hit the ball all that hard, he doesn't run much, and while the glove is solid, it's not so good that it is going to force him on the field. He can be a solid MLB hitter, and Eugenio Suarez' contract is up after this year, so there is a path to fantasy relevance, but it's just not my type of prospect stash. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 69/18/73/.267/.328/.416/7

831) George Valera - CLE, OF, 24.4 - Add Valera to the pile of Cleveland's strong corner depth. I don't know who is going to emerge out of this group, but at least a few of them will emerge over the next few years, and the ones that do can definitely make an impact. Valera had injuries slow his career and allowed others to catch up to him on the depth chart, so now he's in a dog fight like the rest of them. He had a strong year in 2024 with 17 homers, a 90.5 MPH EV and 27/12 K%/BB% in 90 games at Triple-A, showing off the power potential. He still has that damn smooth lefty swing. The best way to play Cleveland's fringier prospects are to probably wait to see who gets the opportunity, and then pounce, rather than hold on, but in deeper leagues you probably don't have that luxury. Something tells me that I still want to bet on Valera, but it will probably come as a strong side of a platoon bat. - 2025 Projection: 15/6/21/.221/.301/.424/1 Prime Projection: 66/23/73/.245/.327/.469/6

832) Johnathan Rodriguez - CLE, OF, 25.5 - Good teams know how to build depth, and Cleveland is building strong offensive depth basically at every position. It's great for real life, but it makes it very hard to know if and when a good but not great prospect will get an opportunity. Rodriguez is in that bucket as a slugger with no defensive value. He destroyed Triple-A, slashing .301/.390/.540 with 29 homers, 8 steals, and a 25.2/12.6 K%/BB% in 118 games. The 7.2 degree launch was low, but the 92.5 MPH EV more than made up for it. He didn't have a good MLB debut in a small sample with a .486 OPS in 40 PA, but he still put up a 91.3 MPH EV. If he gets playing time, there is little doubt that he will be fantasy relevant, but who knows when or if he will get playing time. - 2025 Projection: 18/6/24/.232/.307/.432/2 Prime Projection: 48/16/54/.244/.325/.457/ 5

833) Kala’i Rosario - MIN, OF, 22.9 - I just wrote Rosario up in yesterday's AFL Rundown, and it really encapsulates my thoughts perfectly on him: "An elbow injury knocked Rosario out for almost 3 months mid-season, and in the prospect world, you already know that out of sight, out of mind is a real thing, so it's great to see Rosario back in sight in the AFL. And he's making sure he gets seen with an absolute 113.1 MPH rocket for his first homer. He's 1 for 7 with 2 strikeouts overall. We all know that Rosario is a power hitting beast, and he hit 8 homers in 67 games in Double-A this year, but the reason he didn't crack my End of Season Prospect Rankings is because I don't like the 30.4% K% and 54.2% GB% combo. Huge power conquers all, so I'm not saying he can't overcome the K's and groundballs, but I don't love it. He ranked 211th for me last off-season, and he probably does deserve to rank at least in the Top 300 now too." - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/24/78/.238/.316/.452/5

834) Brooks Baldwin - CHW, 2B/SS, 24.7 - Colson Montgomery is going to take the starting SS job sooner rather than later, but if Chicago slow plays it, or if he struggles hard, Baldwin could be their best option at SS at the moment, and he has the speed to be fantasy relevant. He has a 29.1 ft/sec sprint and he stole 17 bags in 82 games in the upper minors, and then 4 bags in 33 games in the majors. He doesn't have big raw power with an 87.4 MPH EV, but he puts it in the air a ton with a 26.2 launch, so he can pop some dingers. It's certainly a fun homer/steal combo for fantasy, but the plate approach isn't good (25.6/5.0 K%/BB%), and he doesn't hit the ball hard to take advantage of the flyball rates, so it's a recipe for a super low BA (.211 BA). He's likely a utility infielder long term, but one with some fantasy upside. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/31/.227/.290/.393/9

835) Nacho Alvarez - ATL, SS/3B/2B, 22.0 - Nobody is a bigger Nacho fan than me. I named him a super deep sleeper in his FYPD class for deep leagues, and seeing him blossom has been fun to watch, but unfortunately, he's still really only a deep league option. The power/speed combo is just far too lackluster with an 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A and below average speed. He's also not a lift and pull guy, so he can't fall back on that either. The hit tool and plate approach are great with a 15.6/12.8 K%/BB% at Triple-A, but that immediately didn't transfer to the majors with a 31.3/0.0 K%/BB% in 32 PA. He was 21 and it's a super small sample, so I'm not giving it too much credence, but considering the below average power/speed combo, that hit tool/approach needs to be bulletproof. It sure looks like a utility player to me, or a low end regular. - 2025 Projection: 11/2/13/.248/.297/.353/2 Prime Projection: 76/13/62/.276/.338/.411/10

836) Ricardo Cabrera - CIN, 3B/2B/SS, 20.5 - I want to like Cabrera more, but a 83.9 MPH EV in 105 games at Single-A is super underwhelming. He was only 19, so I'm not saying he can't improve there, he almost certainly will, it's just a very low starting point, and it's hard to bet on him truly hitting the ball very hard in the future. It's also not like he was that great statistically, slashing .252/.333/..399 with 11 homers, 19 steals, and a 22.1/6.8 K%/BB%. He also had a 50.2% GB%. He was a high priced international signing who has hit well in pro ball, which is why I feel the pull to like him more, but objectively, he's just not that unique or special of a prospect. He's fine. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/15/71/.264/.322/.411/13

837) Jansel Luis - ARI, 3B/2B/SS, 20.1 - Luis was a breakout candidate coming into 2024, and while he didn't breakout, he did enough to stay on the future breakout radar. He slashed .265/.337/.414 with 7 homers, 20 steals, and a 20.8/7.6 K%/BB% in 109 games at Single-A. He's a pretty explosive player at 6'0'', 170 pounds with plenty of room to add more raw power down the line, but he's still raw in most aspects of his game. He needs to refine the hit tool, plate approach, base stealing, unlocking more game power and defense. It's a lot, but simply hitting the ball harder would cure a lot of ills and he should naturally hit the ball harder as he ages. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/62/.265/.321/.403/18

838) Max Acosta - MIA, SS/2B, 22.5 - Acosta was a popular international target in his incoming 2021 class (by me as well), and while he's had a solid pro career, it just goes to show you that you are really looking for those rocket ship prospects. 2025 will be going on year 5 of holding him, waiting for him to turn into a likely utility infielder by 24 years old. That's 7 years of waiting for maybe a utility player. This is almost the worst case scenario when you select hot international prospect names. You almost rather them be complete busts where you can just move on, rather than hanging around the fringes, which is where Acosta has been hanging. To be fair to him, he's coming off a damn good year in 2024 with a 119 wRC+ in 104 games at Double-A. He slashed .288/.353/.425 with 8 homers, 26 steals (in 35 attempts), and a 13.4/7.8 K%/BB%. He's not a home run hitter, but he's got some pop in his bat, and he's not a true burner, but he likes to run. The most encouraging part is obviously the contact rates. A guy who gets the bat on the ball that much and has a solid up the middle glove is a very high floor prospect. There is definitely a path for him to be a full time regular, but even in that scenario it's probably a low end one. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/8/41/.263/.318/.391/16

839) Andrew Salas - MIA, SS/OF, 17.1 - I can't deny that I'm starting to feel a little worn out/underwhelmed with the Salas family. I was a fan of Andrew's oldest brother, Jose Salas, and liked him as a breakout candidate, but he bottomed out hard in 2023 and 2024. His middle brother, Ethan, has been so insanely hyped for a while now, and his 2024 was underwhelming to say the least. And now here comes Andrew, who is is hit tool/plate approach first prospect with a moderate power/speed combo, which isn't my favorite profile to begin with. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with a quick and controlled swing from both sides of the dish. With those bloodlines, we know he has an advanced feel for the game too. He's a floor over upside type, but it's not like he's devoid of upside, and his floor seems higher than your typical international prospect due to those bloodlines. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/21/77/.262/.326/.423/10

840) Aaron Parker - TOR, C, 22.3 - Searching for pro debut breakouts coming out of the draft has been one of my favorite things to do since I started writing back in 2015/16. Back then, nobody else was really doing it, and now I'm happy to see the prospect hounds out there giving great pro debuts the respect they deserve. Harrison Bader and Willie Calhoun were two of my favorite players from this bucket way back in the day, and both still hold a warm place in my heart to this day. Alex Freeland, Luke Adams and Nacho Alverez were 3 guys I named targets in this bucket in their draft year. And just this past season, CJ Kayfus, Tre Morgan, and Jonathan Long were three guys who cracked my off-season rankings on the back of their excellent pro debuts. Now moving onto this season, Aaron Parker, who was selected 187th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, is someone that is demanding recognition for his pro debut. The dude absolutely smashed the ball with a 93.9 MPH EV, and it resulted in 5 homers and a 154 wRC+ in 24 games. The 27% K% is too high, but he's shown a good feel to hit throughout his amateur career, and it comes with a 17% BB%. He was a 6th round pick known for a good bat and decent catcher defense. Catcher definitely isn't my favorite position to stash for fantasy, but Morgan and Kayfus were 1B without huge power, which also isn't my favorite thing to stash, but look how that turned out. He's my favorite pro debut breakout in this year's class, and is a definite target later in first year player drafts. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 64/18/69/.246/.319/.427/1

841) Cole Messina - COL, C, 21.11 - Selected 77th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, after Aaron Parker, Messina is my top later round catcher target in First Year Player Drafts, and based purely on path to playing time, maybe he should be my top later round target. He has a chance to be a good defensive catcher, Colorado's organizational depth chart at catcher is terrible, and of course, he will get to hit in Colorado. He also has the big power I generally like to target with my catchers, smoking 21 homers in 59 SEC games with the hard hit ability to back it up at 6'0'', 230 pounds. There are hit tool concerns with a 23.4% K% his junior year, but he had a 16.8% K% his sophomore year, and he had a 19.6% K% in his pro debut (17 games at High-A). Granted, he didn't hit well in his pro debut with a 33 wRC+, but in this year's catcher class, you take what you can get. He has the ability to stick behind the plate, the path to playing time, the excellent home park, and power upside. Messina and Parker are my top targets for a late round FYPD catcher in deeper leagues. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 57/18/69/.237/.312/.433/4

842) Carson DeMartini - PHI, 3B/SS, 22.3 - Selected 130th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, DeMartini was a pro debut breakout, and you know how much I love my pro debut breakouts. He slashed .315/.385/.478 with 2 homers, 8 steals, and a 13.5/8.7 K%/BB% in 24 games at Single-A. And it's not like he wasn't an absolute beast in his amateur career too. He put up a 1.110 OPS his freshman year in the ACC, a 1.048 OPS his sophomore year, and a 1.072 OPS with 21 homers in 54 games his junior year. He's not a huge guy at 6'0'', 197 pounds, but he can hit it hard enough, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's also not a burner, but he knows how to steal a bag. The reason he got drafted so late is that he had a 27.7% K% this year in college, but it came with a 16.8% BB%, and it was much better his sophomore year with a 17.1% K%, so it's not like he has some definite fatal flaw there. The fact that he had a 13.5% K% in his pro debut is also a great sign. He might not be a world beater, but DeMartini is a very, very interesting later round college bat for deeper leagues. He's a definite target late in the draft. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/18/69/.253/.321/.422/12

843) Chase Hampton - NYY, RHP, 23.8 - Hampton didn't make his season debut until July 1st due to an elbow injury. When he returned, his stuff was diminished and the results were poor with a 21.1/11.8 K%/BB% in 18.2 IP. He then went right back on the IL with a lower body injury that ended his season. Pitching prospects are fun ;). At full health, he’s 6’2, 200 pounds with mid 90’s heat, a diverse set of secondaries (slider, curve, cutter, change), and solid control/command. He looked like he had the potential to be an impact mid-rotation fantasy starter, and if he returns to full health in 2025, he still has that potential. But the risk couldn't be more evident. 2025 Projection: 2/4.38/1.37/21 in 25 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.91/1.30/157 in 155 IP Update: Out with a UCL injury that seems ominous

844) Camilo Doval - SFG, Setup, 27.10 - Doval's below average control tanked him in 2024, putting up a 14.4% BB% with a 4.88 ERA in 59 IP, including a mid-season demotion to the minors. The 3.44 xERA was better than the ERA, so bad luck was certainly in play, and he still has fire stuff (99.1 MPH cutter) that misses a ton of bats (34.3% whiff% overall). It wouldn't be surprising at all to see Doval have a big year in 2025, but he's going to have to fight to get the closer job back, and it will probably require an injury and/or implosion by Ryan Walker to even get a chance at it. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.49/1.29/82/5 saves in 65 IP

845) Craig Yoho - MIL, Setup, 25.5 - Here is what I wrote about Yoho in my latest Rundown: "Even in my 30 team leagues, I'm not the type to roster minor league relief pitchers. I prefer to get my relievers from super small sample MLB pop ups, but Yoho is really making me rethink that strategy. At least for him in particular. He went 2 perfect innings with 4 K's yesterday and now has a 0.00 ERA with a 52.9/5.9 K%/BB% in 5 IP. This coming off a 42.4% K% in the minors in 2024. Here he is ripping off a disgusting breaker, and that isn't even his best secondary, it's the change. He's just super fun, and I'm getting drawn in." 2025 Projection: 4/3.57/1.21/78 in 60 IP

846) Tyler Holton - DET, Closer Committee, 28.10 - Holton notched 8 saves in 2024 as their main lefty in the pen, and while it seems unlikely for him to ascend to the full time role, you never know. He has a career 2.19 ERA and 0.84 WHIP in 188.2 IP on the back of elite control with a 4.8% BB% in 2024. The fastballs only sit low 90's, but he throws a 5 pitch mix, and the sweeper is a legit bat missing weapon with a 37.9% whiff%. It seems very possible he's Detroit best reliever, so if they don't sign anyone, maybe he can emerge. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.33/0.98/69/10 saves in 80 IP

847) Fraser Allard - CHW, Closer Committee, 27.5 - Chicago's bullpen is an absolute shit show. I have zero clue what is going to happen, but Allard could very well be their best reliever, and despite being a lefty, Chicago might not have any other choice. He put up a 3.75 ERA with a 25.7/11.9 K%/BB% in 24 IP. The 95.1 MPH fastball can miss a respectable amount of bats with a 24.9% whiff%, and the slider was elite with a .133 xwOBA and 41.9% whiff%. The control is below average, so it's not so clear he's any safer than Chicago's other options. If you are chasing saves though, this is an unsettled situation that could pay off if you guess the right guy, and as the top lefty, he could get 10-ish saves regardless. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.95/1.34/69/9 saves in 60 IP

848) Matt Strahm - PHI, Setup, 33.5 - I don't think Strahm is very close to the full time closer role, but he's elite enough to crack this list regardless. He put up a 1.87 ERA with a 33.3/4.6 K%/BB% in 62.2 IP. The 26.7% whiff% shows you probably shouldn't trust that K rate, but he can definitely miss bats with an elite 4-seamer that put up a .229 xwOBA and 26.8% whiff%. The slider is excellent too with a .167 xwOBA and 32.4% whiff%. - 2025 Projection: 5/3.37/1.06/76/3 saves in 63 IP

849) AJ Minter - NYM, Setup, 31.7 - Minter signed a 2 year, $22 million contract with the Mets, which is a good sign the Mets are expecting him healthy coming off hip surgery that ended his 2024 in August. And also coming off a shoulder injury that he returned from mid season with very diminished stuff. I'm not sure I would have given him that contract, but I didn't see the medicals, so what do I know. It also makes it likely he's next man up assuming full health. He was good once again before going down with the injury with a 2.62 ERA and 26.1/8.2 K%/BB% in 34.1 IP, but he wasn't quite as good as his prime. The velocity was down 2 ticks It started down a bit and then just tanked as the season went along, especially after the shoulder injury. The strikeouts also weren't as good as his prime. Even a diminished version of himself can be a good reliever, and unfortunately, I think you have to seriously consider that he could be diminished. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.52/1.17/66/6 saves in 60 IP

850) Robert Stephenson - LAA, Setup, 32.1 - Stephen underwent Tommy John surgery in late April 2024, just a couple months after signing a 3 year deal, which will likely knock him out until mid-season at the earliest. If Ben Joyce is pitching well, I just highly, highly doubt they remove him from the closer job, but if Joyce isn't pitching well, Stephenson could slide in there by the 2nd half, or by 2026. He broke out into the elite tier in 2023 after Tampa unlocked a new cutter, so if he comes back fully healthy, he could definitely make a major impact. Not the worst IL stash, and probably a pretty good one to stash. - 2025 Projection: 1/3.80/1.25/16 in 15 IP

851) Joel Payamps - MIL, Setup, 31.0 - If Megill falters (or gets hurt), I don't think Milwaukee will hesitate to open up the closer role, and Payamps could be the guy who slides in. He nabbed 6 saves in 2024. He's rock solid with a 3.05 ERA and 25.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 59 IP. The 4-seamer misses an elite amount of bats with a 34.5% whiff%, and the slider is average to above average. Nothing flashy, but he's good. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.45/1.14/66/8 saves in 65 IP

852) Chad Green - TOR, Setup, 33.10 - Hoffman failed two medicals before signing with Toronto, so if he gets hurt, it seems Green is next in line after saving 17 games last year. It's not a guarantee though as he has competition for next man up too. His K rate dropped off a cliff in 2024 with a 21.9% K% (23.3% whiff%), but he made up for it with plus control, leading to a 3.21 ERA and 6.7% BB% in 53.1 IP. With the K rate plummeting, and no guarantee he's next man up, I'm not too enticed by him. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.72/1.15/53/6 saves in 55 IP

853) Jose Leclerc - OAK, Setup, 31.4 - Mason Miller has well known injury issues, and it seems Leclerc is next man up in Oakland. He put up a 4.32 ERA with a 30.9/11.1 K%/BB% in 66.2 IP. We know quite well who he is at this point in his career. He's a whiff factory, but the well below average control makes him volatile. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.64/1.26/80/8 saves in 65 IP

854) Beau Brieske - DET, Closer Committee, 27.0 - Brieske was transitioned from a starter to a reliever in 2023, and he started to look mighty comfortable with it in 2024, putting up a 3.59 ERA with a 24.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 67.2 IP. None of his pitches are particularly standout, the 23.9% whiff% is below average, and the control was below average too. At this moment in time, he's more of a solid reliever than a true standout one. Jason Foley is the incumbent, and until the Kenley and Robertson are off the board, I would be scared one of them takes over the role. But Beau cracks this list because if they don't sign anyone, maybe he can sneak in there. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.68/1.28/66/7 saves in 65 IP

855) Justin Slaten - BOS, Setup, 27.7 - Slaten is the young gun in Boston's pen ready to go if the old grandpa's peter out. He has elite control (4% BB%), double plus whiffs (29% whiff%), big velocity (96.4 MPH 4-seamer), and a plus cutter. It resulted in a 2.93 ERA in 55.1 IP. I'm not sure he's the closer of the future, as Boston can keep acquiring vets, but it's certainly possible he does emerge as the long term guy. -2025 Projection: 5/3.38/1.10/70/4 saves in 65 IP

856) Yimi Garcia - TOR, Setup, 34.8 - Hoffman's injury risk makes Toronto an enticing team to take shots on their setup men, and while it seems Green is next in line, Yimi just might be better than him. He put up a 3.46 ERA with a 32/7.8 K%/BB% in 39 IP. The 96.5 MPH 4-seamer was elite with a .256 xwOBA and 31.7% whiff%, and he throws a 6 pitch mix with the curve, sweeper and changeup capable of missing bats. His season ended in August with an elbow injury, so he also has injury risk, and it feels like a lot has to happen for him to end up the closer. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.65/1.14/75/5 saves in 60 IP

857) Jorge Lopez - WSH, Setup, 32.2 - After his on field meltdown with the Mets, he came back a new man with Chicago, putting up a 2.03 ERA with a 29.2/7.5 K%/BB% in 26.2 IP. I thought it was too harsh for the Mets to cut him, so I'm happy he came back and redeemed himself. His velocity was up with Chicago, so he was clearly amped up to shove it in the Mets faces. Which also begs the question, was he not trying that hard with the Mets? He throws 2 mid 90's fastballs and he has 3 good secondaries in his slider, curve and changeup. The ingredients are definitely in here to be good, and quite frankly, he was good in 2 for the last 3 years. With Finnegan re-signing though, he's back in a setup role. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.70/1.25/65/5 saves in 65 IP Update: Washington re-signed Finnegan to reprise his role as the closer

858) Evan Phillips - LAD, Setup, 30.7 - LA has nine million guys, and it seems like Phillips is on the outs, but he's racked up 42 saves over the last 2 years, so I guess I'll put him on this list. He took a step back in 2024 with a 3.62 ERA and 27.6/7.5 K%/BB% in 54.2 IP, but the stuff is still good, and we know relievers can have wonky years. He cracks this list more for track record than his current path to saves. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.40/1.15/70/5 saves in 60 IP

859) Ryan Zeferjahn - LAA, Setup, 27.1 - He put up a 2.21 ERA with a 28.1/9.4 K%/BB% in 17 IP. His three pitch mix was straight elite with a 97.3 MPH 4-seamer that put up a 37.1% whiff%, a cutter that put up a .224 xwOBA, and a sweeper that put up a .153 xwOBA. He was good at Triple-A too. Obviously it's a small sample and he hasn't been all that great in his career up until this year, but relievers pop up like this all the time, and he clearly has the stuff. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.74/1.25/66/4 saves in 60 IP

860) Rece Hinds - CIN, OF, 24.7 - How can a guy who put up a 1.051 OPS with 5 homers and 2 steals in his 51 PA MLB debut not make this list? Well, I guess the answer to that question is by striking out 37.9% of the time and putting up a 68 wRC+ at Triple-A. Maybe he shouldn't make this list, but Hinds has very real upside, and he's close to the majors, so let's roll the dice. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 215 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He had a 29.2 ft/sec sprint with a 91.6 MPH EV and 18.9 degree launch in the majors. He smacked 14 homers with 20 steals in 99 games at Triple-A. If he can even strikeout just like 32% of the time, he could do some major fantasy damage, as he did in the majors with a 31.4% K%. Odds are he can't hit enough to become an MLB regular, but in shallower leagues especially, why not take a shot on this kind of close to the majors upside at this point in the rankings. - 2025 Projection; 16/6/21/.207/.266/.412/3 Prime Projection: 42/16/56/.219/.282/.432/10

861) Mac Horvath - TBR, 2B/3B/OF, 23.8 - Horvath is a lift and pull machine, so it's unsurprising that Tampa was intrigued by him in a mid-season trade, and it's an upgrade to get out of Baltimore's logjam. The hit tool is the real problem though with .229 BA and 25.9% K% in 102 games at High-A, and it got way worse after the trade to Tampa with a 34.6% K% in 31 games. He's an excellent athlete with power and speed, but his K rates have been very high in the lower minors, which is not a great sign for an advanced college bat. If anyone can make it work, it's Tampa, but often a guy like this ends up in a part time role for them in their mid to late 20's, which is only so helpful for fantasy. Still a decent upside shot though if the hit tool can improve. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/16/56/.233/.309/.422/18

862) Jud Fabian - BAL, OF, 24.6 - Fabian's contact rates always seem to be on the brink of total implosion before he brings them back off the ledge. He put up a 29.4% K% at Florida at 20 year old, before improving that to 22.3% in his age 21 season. He put up a 37.5% K% at Double-A in 2023, and then improved that in 2024 with a 29.9% K%. And then he got to Triple-A this year where he put up a 40.8% K% in 30 games, but we know how this story goes, and I'm expecting that to come down in 2025. Just how far down he can get it down against MLB pitching is the ultimate question, and while it seems likely he will never be able to get it down quite enough, the power/speed/defense trifecta is good enough to roster him in medium to deeper leagues on the off chance he can. He jacked out 20 homers with 16 steals in 128 games, and he put up a 117 wRC+ at Double-A. He'll compete with Beavers and Bradfield for bench at bats/next man up status in 2025, and while my money is one Beavers or Bradfield, don't completely count out Fabian. - 2025 Projection: 11/3/16/.210/.289/.389/2 Prime Projection: 55/18/53/.228/.309/.429/11

863) Colton Ledbetter - TBR, OF, 23.5 - Ledbetter was a 22 year old advanced college bat in the lower minors, so the 28.3/8.1 K%/BB% in 109 games at High-A isn't a great sign, but the power/speed numbers were there with 16 homers and 34 steals, and the 130 wRC+ was just fine as well. He hits the ball in the air a ton with a 28.6% GB%, and he's always been an excellent base stealer with some speed. It's likely he ends up in some kind of strong side of a platoon role with the Rays (he hits righties much better than lefties), but the power/speed combo is in here to make an impact when he gets on the field. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 56/15/61/.244/.318/.429/15

864) Dylan Dreiling - TEX, OF, 21.11 - Selected 65th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Dreiling is a proven SEC performer from the second he stepped on campus and is a complete hitter, slashing .342/.459/.715 with 23 homers, 4 steals, and a 20.5%/17.5% K%/BB% in 71 games at Tennessee. He hits the ball hard and he's a disciplined hitter. He's likely a corner outfielder, he's not a huge guy at 5'11'', 197 pounds, the K rate is a bit high, and he doesn't run much, so I'm not sure the upside is super high, but it's a testament to how deep this year's college bat class is that you can get a guy with these kind of numbers this late. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/18/74/.248/.324/.423/7

865) Dakota Jordan - SFG, OF, 21.11 - Selected 116th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft but signing for $2 million, Jordan is a beast at the dish at a rock solid 6'0'', 220 pounds, and he has the big power to back up the build with 20 homers in 63 games. I don't love the crouched batting stance, but he kinda rises up as the pitch comes, and it's an athletic swing, so I'm not holding it against him. The hit tool is the biggest issue with a 29% K%, and he also hits the ball on the ground a lot. That is not the best combo of skills to have, but hard hit ability can conquer all, and Jordan has done nothing but hit the ball hard and produce his entire career. If he landed somewhere other than SF, I could maybe see liking him more, but I just can't come around on him being one of my guys. Love the obvious huge power, but too many other things are going against him (contact, grounders, ballpark). - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/21/74/.226/.311/.434/4

866) Cole Mathis - CHC, 1B, 21.8 - Selected 54th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Mathis is 6'1'', 210 pounds and he looks big and physical in the box with a strong and controlled righty swing. He didn't play in a major conference (CAA), but he dominated the competition put in front of him, slashing .335/.472/.650 with 14 homers, 14 steals, and a 12.6/18.1 K%/BB% in 52 games. Maybe most impressively, he obliterated the wood bat Cape league too, slashing .318/.381/.667 with 11 homers, 0 steals, and a 17.0/8.2 K%/BB% in 38 games. He's a really good all around hitter with the ability to hit for power and average, and while he's not a burner, he's definitely a good athlete. He's a good pitcher too, and while his future is likely with the bat, I wouldn't rule out a return to pitching if he doesn't develop as hoped. He didn't make his pro debut yet, he didn't face the toughest competition in college, and I prefer my 1B bats to have big time game power already, but there is plenty to like here. And despite those negatives, a smart organization took him pretty high, although I suspect part of that reason is because pitching might not end up on as much of the back burner as we think, which isn't great for fantasy. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 71/18/73/.263/.329/.427/9

867) Eddie Rynders - PIT, 3B, 19.5 - Selected 229th overall (and signed for slot value) in the 2024 MLB Draft, the best way I can describe Rynders' lefty swing is that it's a bit gangly, but it's definitely big and powerful at 6'2'', 195 pounds. He has legit power upside and he's a good athlete too. He struck out 7 times in 13 PA in the 2024 MLB Draft League, and while that is clearly a very small sample, I think it does foreshadow some possible hit tool issues in pro ball. He's a power first high risk, high reward high school bat. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 66/23/78.241/.313/.435/9

868) Luis Merejo - CLE, 1B, 18.10 - Merejo put up a 147 wRC+ in the DSL in 2023, a 123 wRC+ in stateside rookie in 2024, and then finally a 145 wRC+ in 30 games at Single-A to close out the season as a barely 18 year old. The guy does nothing but produce, and at a well built 6'2", he definitely looks the part as well. He's not really excelling in any one way with a 24.8% K%, 3 homers and 3 steals in 30 games at Single-A, but with a 30.6% GB%, the power should only tick up from here. I generally like my 1B prospects to already have big game power, and his K rates, even in rookie ball, are on the high side, but his age, production, size, and lift all point towards a possible blowup in future years. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 74/22/79/.255/.333/.446/7

869) Will Simpson - TBR, 1B, 23.7 - The good pro debut strikes again. Granted, this one slipped by even me, but Simpson isn't slipping by me anymore. He was a 15th round pick in 2023, but he stepped right into pro ball and raked with 6 homers and a .910 OPS in 36 games at mostly Single-A. In 2024, he just kept on producing, but this time he did it in the upper minors, slashing .348/.408/.493 with 2 homers, 1 steal, and a 23.7/9.2 K%/BB% in 18 games at Double-A. He destroyed High-A too with 16 homers and a 142 wRC+ in 109 games. He's 6'3'', 225 pounds with a powerful righty swing, and he can lift and pull it, so his power is legit. The bat has a high bar to clear, making the most reasonable projection as a part time power bat, but if he does get playing time, he can hit homers. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/16/64/.245/.318/.438/3

870) Rayner Arias - SFG, OF, 18.11 - Arias was an absolute machine in the DSL in 2023 with 4 homers and a 230 wRC+ in 16 games, but he couldn't repeat that magic in stateside rookie in 2024 with 0 homers and a 98 wRC+ in 25 games. The 25.7% K% was too high, he showed no power and he's not great on the bases (3 for 6). He's had some injury issues in his young career (multiple wrist injuries after diving for balls in the OF), and considering the $2.7 million signing bonus at a projectable 6'2'', 185 pounds, some patience is prudent here. The down and injured 2024 has his stock dropping, but I want to give him one more year before really tanking him. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/20/73/.257/.324/.428/9

871) Khal Stephen - TOR, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 59th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Stephen reminds me of a classic Seattle Mariners type pitcher. He's a big guy at 6'4'', 225 pounds with good control of a good low to mid 90's fastball as his bread and butter. The slider is also pretty good and he'll use a decent change against lefties. It all resulted in a 3.28 ERA with a 27.9/5.5 K%/BB% in 96 IP in the SEC. It's probably more #4 type upside right now, but I think there are multiple paths for him to bump that up to a #3 in a best case scenario. Pitching in Seattle would have been one of those best case scenarios, but obviously he got drafted by Toronto, so he will not have that advantage. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/4.09/1.25/149 in 160 IP

872) David Shields - KCR, LHP, 18.7 - Selected 41st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Shields is a very athletic 6'2'', 210 pounds who was an excellent high school quarterback as well. He has a smooth lefty swing too even though his future is definitely on the mound, but it does show the type of athlete he is. You can see that athleticism on the mound with a lefty delivery that is easy to dream on, especially since he was one of the youngest players in the draft. The stuff isn't quite as exciting yet with a low 90's fastball and 3 still developing secondaries (slider, curve, changeup), but he throws a ton of strikes, and it's so easy to project improvement on all of his pitches. There is definitely nice upside in here if the velocity ticks up and he refines the secondaries, but there is also a long way to go. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.16/1.27/145 in 150 IP

873) Luis Lara - MIL, OF, 20.4 - Lara is your typical little guy (5'7'') contact/speed play with a 15.7% K% and 45 steals in 110 games at High-A. There isn't much hope for more power coming with only 4 homers, and the 95 wRC+ is underwhelming, but he was very young for the level. I had hope that he could be one of the higher end versions of this profile, but after the lackluster season, he just wasn't able to separate himself from the pack. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/8/47/.267/.321/.374/26

874) Kendall George - LAD, OF, 20.5 - George lived up to his billing as a contact/speed play after getting drafted 36th overall in 2023, slashing .279/.384/.328 with 1 homer, 36 steals, and a 20.5/14.1 K%/BB% in 86 games at Single-A. The reason he doesn't rank higher is because that power output is true bottom of the scale, the 20.5% K% is higher than optimal, and he got caught 12 times on the bases. Usually with these types I want to see truly elite contact rates or potential for legit power, and it doesn't seem like George has either of those right now. Still a good speed first prospect though. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/6/45/.267/.330/.369/31

875) Lisbel Diaz - SFG, OF, 19.8 - Diaz is a big physical dude at 6'2'', 201 pounds, and he's hit everywhere he's been, including in full season ball as a 18 year old in 2024. He slashed .279/.333/.433 with 6 homers, 8 steals, and a 18.8/5.5 K%/BB% in 55 games at the level. This coming off a 138 wRC+ in 22 games at stateside rookie earlier in the year, and a 124 wRC+ in 22 games in the DSL in 2023. He needs to learn how to lift the ball more to get to his pretty considerable raw power with about 50% groundball rates, but he mitigates that a bit by pulling it over 50% of the time, and he's a good athlete for his size too. The approach isn't great and there are some hit tool concerns, but Diaz is legitimately exciting. He's definitely underrated. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/20/76/.251/.317/.428/9

876) Dasan Hill - MIN, LHP, 19.3 - Selected 69th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Hill is a thin and lanky 6'4'', 170 pounds who reminds me a bit of Brandon Williamson (Williamson was even lankier at 6'6''). He should theoretically put on weight and gain velocity, but he also might just stay skinny and lanky with low to mid 90's heat. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus slider, potentially above average change, and good control with an athletic lefty delivery. He's not my favorite high school arm drafted in this area, but his talent is right there with them. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 8/4.12/1.31/145 in 155 IP

877) Payton Tolle - BOS, LHP, 22.5 - Selected 50th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, when you think of Tolle, think something like a Joey Cantillo type. The fastball might not be huge, the control might be not be great, but he's a big lefty (6'6'', 250 pounds) with an effective low 90's fastball and a diverse pitch mix. He'll never likely get the big prospect hype, but before you know it he'll be knocking on the door of the bigs while continuing to pitch effectively at every level. He put up a 3.21 ERA with a 37.1/11.0 K%/BB% in 81.1 IP his junior year. He was a two way player in college, so that gives you an idea of his general athleticism. He doesn't have the highest upside, and there is also risk, but like Cantillo, he just feels like a guy who will keep getting the job done. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.91/1.30/158 in 160 IP

878) Ryan Forcucci - HOU, RHP, 22.4 - Selected 101st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the Astros took the Tommy John discount in the 3rd round on Forcucci as he was in the running to be a first round pick before his season ended just 5 starts into the season. He hurt his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery in June, which will likely delay his pro debut until mid-season 2025 at the earliest. He was in the midst of a Junior year breakout before going down with the injury with a 2.16 ERA and 37/6 K/BB in 25 IP. The fastball sits mid 90's and is a bat missing weapon, which he combines with a plus slider as he his best secondary. He also mixes in a curve and changeup to give him a starter's pitch mix. The righty delivery is controlled, athletic and pretty explosive. I wouldn't say he's generally my type to take the Tommy John discount on, but he shouldn't be very expensive, so if I wanted a more advanced arm later in the draft, and Forcucci was sitting there, I could see taking that shot. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/4.05/1.28/145 in 150 IP

879) Bryce Cunningham - NYY, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 53rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Cunningham is a built up 6'5'', 230 pounds with the big mid 90's fastball to match. He combines the heat with a slider and changeup that can both miss bats, giving him 3 legit pitches with bat missing ability. There is a reason the Yanks selected him relatively high despite pretty lackluster college production. He has a career 4.95 ERA in 160 IP in the SEC, and while 2024 was his best season, it wasn't exactly dominant with a 4.36 ERA and 26.6/9.4 K%/BB% in 84.2 IP. The stuff gives him a high real life floor as a potentially impact reliever, and there is rotation upside too if he can improve his control/command and continue to refine his pitch arsenal. He's not the worst option if you are looking for a college arm in the mid to late rounds of your First Year Player Draft, but he's not exactly a target for me either. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/4.22/1.33/146 in 150 IP

880) Chase Mobley - CLE, RHP, 18.10 - Selected 295th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft but signing for $1.8 million, Mobley's talent backs up that signing bonus at 6'5'', 205 pounds with a mid 90's fastball that he fires from a funky, low slot arm angle. That pitch is a straight nightmare for high school hitters, and he combines that with a potentially plus changeup and two breaking balls that need refinement. He generally throws the ball over the plate and the delivery is athletic. Cleveland is an excellent organization for pitcher development, and there are so many things to like here (size, athleticism, strike throwing). Mobley is a definite later round pitcher target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 11/3.73/1.21/166 in 160 IP

881) Johnny King - TOR, LHP, 18.7 - Selected 95th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft but signing for $1.25 million, King is one of the youngest players in the class, and he also has the size and stuff to get pretty excited. He's 6'3'', 210 pounds with an athletic three quarters arm slot delivery that fires off a low to mid 90's fastball to go along with two damn nasty breaking balls. He has to refine all aspects of his game, and the velocity likely has to tick up to reach his upside, but at only 18 years old, all of that could be coming down the line. He's damn electric out there. I like King as a later round upside pitcher. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 11/3.82/1.29/169 in 160 IP

882) Owen Hall - DET, RHP, 19.5 - Selected 49th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Hall is 6'3'', 185 pounds with an explosive arm action that fires a low to mid 90's fastball that blows right by hitters. He combines that with two good breaking balls in his slider and curve, and he rounds out the arsenal with a developing changeup. While the ball explodes out of his hand, the delivery does look a bit relievery, and he does have some control risk, so there is definitely bullpen risk here if he can't improve his control and/or develop the changeup more. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.95/1.32/155 in 150 IP

883) Kevin Alvarez - HOU, OF, 17.2 - I love the guys where the bat looks like an absolute twig when they swing it, and that applies to the 6'4'', 185 pound Alvarez who has an easy, but lightning fast lefty swing. He's known for his advanced approach and good feel to hit, so when he adds more power onto on his projectable frame, this could end up a truly potent hit/power combo masher from a corner outfield spot. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 79/24/84/.263/.342/.451/8

884) Mitchell Parker - WSH, LHP, 25.6 - Mitchell is a back end arm who is going to have to fight for a rotation spot, but he cracks this list because his secondaries miss enough bats to give him a smidge of upside over some of the other back end guys who didn't crack this list. His splitter put up a 37.4% whiff% and his slider put up a 36.4% whiff%. His control also leveled up into above average territory in 2024 with a 6.7% BB%. It resulted in a 4.29 ERA and 20.6% K% in 151 IP in the majors. The 92.5 MPH fastball is bad, and it's likely a back end arm, or worse, a depth arm, but his youth, solid 2024, and swing and miss secondaries get him on the list. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.30/1.31/130 in 150 IP

885) Jake Irvin - WSH, RHP, 28.1 - Irvin is a back end starter who is just interesting enough to crack this list. He has above average control of a pretty damn good 93.9 MPH fastball that put up a .294 xwOBA and 23.5% whiff%. He throws a six pitch, so if another pitch can emerge (the changeup has the most impact potential, but he rarely goes to it), there is some real mid rotation upside. - 2025 Projection: 10/4.12/1.26/145 in 170 IP

886) Dairon Blanco - KCR, OF, 31.11 - Kyle Isbel is the main CF in KC, but it would be more fun for fantasy if it was Blanco. Blanco has elite speed with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint, and it led to 31 steals in just 88 games (and only 132 PA). He wasn't too bad of a hitter either with a 94 wRC+, and he's got some pop with an above average 7.8% barrel% and 89 MPH EV. He's not particularly good on defense, the 24.2/6.1 K%/BB% isn't good, he's already basically 32 years old, and he hits lefties much better than righties, so he's likely a speedy 4th outfielder/pinch runner, but if he does get on the field, he will make a fantasy impact. - 2025 Projection: 41/6/28/.256/.313/.402/28

887) Ezequiel Duran - TEX, 3B/OF, 25.10 - I loved Duran in 2023 and into the off-season, and while I was worried about his playing time, I wasn't worried about his talent. It turns out I should have been worried about both as his quality of contact dropped off a cliff in 2024. His Barrel% went from 8.7% to 3.4%, his EV dropped from 90.1 MPH to 87.1 MPH, and his launch dropped from 14.0 degrees to 8.9 degrees. It resulted in a 74 wRC+, 3 homers, and a 1 steal in 285 PA. He swings a quick bat with an above average 72.6 MPH swing speed and he's very fast with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint, so it's not like I was imagining things loving him so much. And his contact rates improved with an average 22.1% K% and 24.7% whiff%. But both the underlying and surface stats numbers were terrible in 2024, and he clearly doesn't have a starting job, or probably a next man up job either, so he's no longer target. He remains on the radar though, and that swing speed tells me he should be able to do better in 2025. 2025 Projection: 31/8/28/.255/.300/.400/5

888) Nelson Velazquez - KCR, OF, 26.3 - Velazquez couldn't back up his 2023 breakout, and it resulted in him getting sent down to the minors in June after putting up a .200 BA with only 8 homers in 64 games. Not only did the hit tool tank him, but the power was way down too with a 8.8% Barrel% (21.4% in 2023). He's now out of a job and will have to hit his way back into one, but because KC's outfield is so wide open, there is opportunity for him to do it. - 2025 Projection: 34/11/35/.225/.301/.417/4

889) Alek Thomas - ARI, OF, 24.11 - I wouldn't write Thomas off from winning that starting CF job in Arizona, which is holding me back from liking Jake McCarthy more. Thomas has plus contact rates with a 16.5% K%, he hits the ball very hard with a 91.2/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV, and he has above average speed with a 27.8 ft/sec sprint. Good things tend to happen on a baseball field when you have that trifecta of skills, and while good things haven't happened for Thomas in the majors with a career .226 BA, I have to think that is majorly unlucky. He put up a .278 xBA in 2024 vs. a .189 BA in 39 games. That is a major discrepancy. With how often he's underperformed the xBA, you can't say it's all unlucky, but I have a hard time believing that a large portion of it isn't. The launch is terrible at 1 degree and he doesn't run nearly enough, so he's not a great fantasy target himself, he's just more of a thorn in McCarthy's side. - 2025 Projection: 42/8/39/.245/.298/.395/9

890) Eguy Rosario - SDP, 3B, 25.7 - On surface stats alone, Rosario had an excellent season at both Triple-A and the majors. He slashed .263/.361/.531 with 21 homers, 19 steals, and a 21.3/12.3 K%/BB% in 95 games at Triple-A, and then he popped 3 homers with a 125 wRC+ in 57 MLB PA. The underlying numbers weren't bad either, but they weren't quite as impressive with a 86.8 MPH EV at Triple-A, and a 41.9% whiff% and 34.7% Chase% in the majors. Granted, he did crush the ball in the majors with a 14.7% Barrel%, and he definitely has some legit raw juice in his bat. He ran a lot in the minors, but he wasn't a particularly good base stealer, and he's not a burner, so while he'll likely contribute in the category, I wouldn't expect big totals. He seems like a bench bat to me optimally, but San Diego is thin, so he's not far away from playing time. - 2025 Projection: 29/8/34/.241/.298/.417/4

891) Gage Workman - CHC, SS/3B, 25.5 - The Cubs took Workman 10th overall in the Rule 5 Draft, giving him a leg up on a roster spot, and with 3B currently ticketed for an unproven rookie, Matt Shaw (who I obviously absolutely love, but as we all know, nothing is guaranteed), it's conceivable that Workman ends up fantasy relevant in 2025. There is very real fantasy upside in here too at 6'4'', 202 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He also had a big time year at Double-A, slashing .280/.366/.476 with 18 homers, 30 steals, and a 27.5/11.7 K%/BB% in 126 games. He was 24 years old and the hit tool is a major issue, which is why he was available in the Rule 5, but if he can make enough hit tool gains in his mid to late 20's, which we've seen plenty of toolsy prospects do in the past, he will get interesting in a hurry. He's a lefty who was much better vs. righties than he was vs lefties, but I think that's a good thing in this case, because it means he can end up a very fun strong side of a platoon player. And his 25.2% K% vs. righties was a tad better. I kinda like him in deeper leagues as a proximity play. - 2025 Projection: 17/5/19/.218/.289/.381/5 Prime Projection: 44/11/41/.231/.309/.413/15

892) Payton Eeles - MIN, 2B/3B, 25.4 - Payton Eeles is the type of player you want to root for. He's 5'5'' and went undrafted after playing 4 years at a Division II school. So he played a 5th year in Division 1, and then he played in Indy Ball. And oh yea, he's literally raked everywhere he's been. Minnesota gave him a shot in 2024, and he continued to do what he's done everywhere, and that is produce all the way through Triple-A. He slashed .299/.419/.500 with 8 homers, 20 steals, and a 14.6/12.7 K%/BB% in 64 games. He's only 5'5'', but he's thick and he's damn explosive. He's almost like an older version of Jett Williams and Slade Caldwell, except without a one hundredth of the respect. He only put up an 85.4 MPH EV at Triple-A, and the groundball rates are around 50%, so there isn't much power upside, but the hit/speed combo looks pretty damn good. It's probably a utility infielder long term, which is still a super fun success story, but I wouldn't be so sure to cap him there. I think he has starting 2B potential. - 2025 Projection: 19/2/11/.249/.303/.355/7 Prime Projection: 74/10/52/.266/.328/.379/28

893) Billy Cook - PIT, 1B, 26.3 - Cook is a 26 year old who just put up a 38.8/0.0 K%/BB% in his 49 PA MLB debut, and his strikeout rates have been anywhere from the mid 20's to upper 30's in the minors, so the hit tool probably isn't good enough to be an MLB starter, but he's quietly kinda interesting. He put up a 92.6/97.1 MPH AVG/FB EV in the majors, and he's a launch machine with a 28.6 degree launch. Neither of those numbers were quite as extreme in Triple-A, but this guy is going to hit homers, and he hit 3 in his 16 game MLB debut (17 homers in 115 games in the minors). He's also really fast with a 29.3 ft/sec sprint, and he's a good base stealer with 26 steals in 32 attempts. Pitt traded for Cook at the deadline from Baltimore, so they obviously like him. In deeper leagues, he's a really fun proximity play, and even in shallower leagues he's worth a looksie if you see him getting full time at bats at some point in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 31/9/35/.225/.298/.416/5

894) Cooper Bowman - CIN, 2B/OF, 25.2 - The Reds selected Bowman 7th overall in the Rule 5 Draft, which gives him a leg up on an Opening Day roster spot, and it seems like he could be next man up at several positions for them now. And if he does get pushed into full time action, he has the base running ability to make a fantasy impact with 43 steals in 118 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The Athletics left him unprotected for a reason, and that reason is that the hit/power combo probably isn't good enough to be a true MLB starter. He hit 0 homers with a 80.5 MPH EV, 24.3/7.9 K%, .218 BA and 48 wRC+ in 38 games at Triple-A. Granted he hit much better at Double-A with 12 homers, a 20.2/12.4 K%/BB% and a 138 wRC+ in 80 games, but at 24 years old, he's already too old to be taking his upper minors numbers fully seriously. I see some similarities with David Hamilton, and like Hamilton, if Bowman gets the at bats, the steals should keep him afloat in fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 38/6/31/.232/.304/.379/16

895) Homer Bush Jr. - TBR, OF, 23.5 - Bush was a college bat who didn't exactly dominate High-A with a 111 wRC+ in 86 games, but he doesn't have the type of profile to dominate a level. He's the type where he can do what he does regardless of the competition, which is run like wild (57 steals) and get the bat on the ball (18.8/9.3 K%/BB%). He's 6'2'', 200 pounds, so he has the size to add more power, but it's really not a big part of his game with 6 homers. He's likely a part time player, but with his speed, he's a part time player that can make an impact. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 71/8/42/.258/.321/.391/28

896) Jonatan Clase - TOR, OF, 22.10 - There were points where I really liked Clase, and only 22 years old, maybe I shouldn't be so quick to cool on him, but the warts in his profile are starting to take forefront in my mind. He doesn't hit the ball hard with an 85.8 MPH EV at AAA and 0 Barrels in his 66 PA MLB debut, and at a small 5'10'', it's hard to expect a lot more there. He's also had contact issues his entire career with a 26% K% at AAA and a 25.8% K% in the majors. And lastly, he has a below average 70.7 MPH swing which is even worse from the left side with a 69.3 MPH swing (the side he swings with more often). He's also not particularly great on defense. He has elite speed and base running ability, which makes him so fun for fantasy, but I think a bench OF is his most likely role. At only 22, maybe he can make improvements to the power, defense, and hit tool, which is why I don't want to write him off completely, but I'm just not too excited by him anymore. - 2025 Projection: 25/3/21/.228/.292/.360/9 Prime Projection: 63/10/41/.249/.319/.391/24

897) Hao-Yu Lee - DET, 2B, 22.2 - Lee's season ended on August 15th with lumbar spine inflammation, but he was having an impressive season before going down with the injury, slashing .298/.363/.488 with 12 homers, 16 steals, and a 17.9/8.5 K%/BB% in 87 games at Double-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+ as a 21 year old, which is damn good. He doesn't jump off the screen at 5'10'', and he doesn't jump off the screen electricity wise either, but he's just a really solid baseball player who has produced everywhere he's been, and now that's continued in the upper minors. The power/speed combo isn't huge, he's not particularly good on defense, and the hit tool is good, but not great, so he's not exactly one of my favorite targets, but there is average across the board potential here at peak. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/18/71/.261/.323/.416/12

898) Eiberson Castellano - MIN, RHP, 23.11 - Castellano was selected by Minnesota in the Rule 5 Draft, which means it's likely they are going to keep him in the bullpen all season. I'm not sure it's a great thing for his fantasy value as it will be easy for him to just get stuck in the bullpen. But I like his profile enough to still crack this list on the change he can work his way into the rotation. He's a big boy at 6'3'' but the delivery is pretty damn athletic for his size. He also has really good stuff with a mid 90's fastball, a potentially plus curve, and a solid changeup. It all resulted in a 3.99 ERA with a 31.3/6.7 K%/BB% in 103.2 IP split between High-A and Double-A (he was just as good at each level). I do think his selection dooms him to the bullpen unfortunately, but on his own merits, he's a pretty interesting pitching prospect. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.98/1.31/65 in 65 IP

899) Connor Prielipp - MIN, LHP, 24.3 - Prielipp is likely a reliever long term with 2 major elbow surgeries (Tommy John and then internal brace) since 2021, but when he got back on the mound in 2024, he showed off impressive upside. He put up a 2.70 ERA with a 45.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 23.1 IP at mostly High-A. The fastball sits mid 90's and is a bat missing, which he pairs with a plus to double plus slider. It was only the lower minors, his injury history scares me, and it was only in short outings, so I lean him being a reliever, but I lean upside in fantasy, and even as a reliever he can make an impact. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 4/3.45/1.21/76 in 65 IP

900) Tekoah Roby - STL, RHP, 23.6 - I poured some cold water on Roby this off-season when everyone was ranking him over Tink Hence (not me, and maybe some foreshadowing on everyone ranking Quinn Mathews over Hence now, although I actually like Mathews a ton, so it's not a completely comparable situation), and Roby had a straight terrible season. He put up a 6.57 ERA with a 22.2/8.5 K%/BB% in 38.1 IP at mostly Double-A. He missed a large chunk of the season due to a shoulder injury, but he looked just as bad before the injury as he did when he returned from it. He can definitely bounce back in 2025 if he's healthy with a mid 90's fastball, plus curve, and diverse pitch mix, but he's just not a very highly sought after pitching prospect right now. He's in prove it territory. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.27/1.33.133 in 140 IP

901) Henry Lalane - NYY, LHP, 20.10 - Lalane was a fun breakout pick before the season, but he was limited to just 12.1 IP due to shoulder fatigue. It was a completely lost season. This is just the life of a pitching prospect, and it's why rookie ball pitchers are some of my least favorite prospects to go after. There is just so much that can go wrong. But when you play the rookie ball pitcher game, you know what you are getting into, so the hope is that he can come back completely healthy in 2025 and immediately get the hype rolling again. Here was my blurb for him in the 2024 Top 1,000, and nothing has really changed assuming full health: "Rookie ball pitchers aren’t my favorite to go after, but if you are going to go after one, a 6’7”, 211 pound lefty with good stuff and good numbers isn’t a bad choice. Lalane put up a 36.6%/4.5% K%/BB% in 21.2 IP in stateside rookie ball with 3 potentially plus pitches (fastball, breaking ball, changeup). He only reached 4 IP in one outing, and the fastball sits in the low to mid 90’s, so there is a long way to go, but if you squint hard enough, you can see a CC Sabathia starter pack here. Here’s to hoping he can pack on 130 pounds of pure Captain Crunch to fulfill his destiny." ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/165 in 160 IP

902) Ty Floyd - CIN, RHP, 23.8 - Floyd underwent shoulder surgery and missed all of 2024. He's yet to pitch in the pros. I liked him as a FYPD college arm, but who knows how healthy he will be coming off the surgery. Here was my blurb for him before the injury: " Selected 38th overall, the 6’2”, 200 pound Floyd has a plus to double plus mid 90’s fastball that he leans on heavily. It led to a 4.35 ERA with a 31% K% in 91 IP. There are more than a few heavy fastball usage pitchers who are doing well in the majors right now, but those guys generally have plus control and/or better secondaries than Floyd. Floyd’s control is below average with a 9.6% BB%, but it was improving as the year went on, and his slider, curve and change are about average at best. If the secondaries and/or control take a step forward, there is very real upside here, and I don’t mind targeting him at all as a later round arm if you focus on offense with your earlier picks." ... now with the injury risk though, he's really more in pure flier territory, especially having to pitch in Cincy. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.28/1.31/135 in 140 IP

903) Kannon Kemp - SDP, RHP, 20.7 - Selected 251st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, but signing for a well over slot deal, Kannon Kemp cracks this list on name alone. Come to think of it, the Padres drafted Boston Bateman, Kale Fountain, Kash Mayfield, Kannon Kemp, Tyson Neighbors, Kavares Tears, Cobb Hightower, and Brandon Butterworth. Are they just picking guys based on cool names? But Kemp is not just a cool name, he also cracks this list for potential at a projectable 6'6'', 225 pounds with a low to mid 90's fastball that has he good control over and has the potential to be a plus pitch. He combines the fastball with good feel for a slider and changeup, but both pitches still need more refinement. His path can still take many directions, but plus control of a really good fastball with 2 solid secondaries and a beastly frame is a really good profile to bet on. I like Kemp a lot. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.24/160 in 160 IP

904) Brody Brecht - COL, RHP, 22.6 - Okay, I guess I'll put a Coors pitcher on here. Maybe it's the Dollander afterglow that is easing me up, even if Dollander hasn't proven anything yet really. We all already knew he was a really good prospect (granted, he's been better than really good, he's been great), but it was Coors Field that is the looming problem that he's yet to truly conquer. Either way, Brecht was selected 38th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, and he deserves to crack this list. He's 6'4'', 235 pounds and is an elite athlete who also played wide receiver for Iowa. I'm gonna be honest, his delivery doesn't really look all that athletic to me, and maybe that is why he put up a 14.2% BB% in 78.1 IP, which is simply way too high. The hope is that by focusing solely on baseball, that can improve, and he did have his best season after dropping football, putting up a 3.33 ERA with a 37.2% K%. The stuff is also legit with a mid to upper 90's fastball, two heavily used, bat missing sliders, and a developing split change. The upside is very obviously quite big, but his control issues, and getting drafted by Colorado prevents me from buying. I'm just not in the market for Coors pitchers. It's as simple as that. It's hard enough being a pitching prospect, and I only like to roster a small percentage of pitching prospects anyway, so a Coors pitcher is just never going to be one of them for me. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.15/1.33/169 in 160 IP

905) Luke Holman - CIN, RHP, 22.3 - Selected 71st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Holman is a safety over upside arm with a strong history of production in the toughest conference in college baseball (SEC). He put up a 2.75 ERA with a 33.7/8.8 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP this year. The stuff isn't off the charts, but the low to mid 90's fastball is a good pitch with good life and bat missing ability. The slider is his best secondary and it misses a ton of bats, and he has a good curve too. The control/command is about average. It's not the most enticing profile, but it's why he will be available pretty late in first year player drafts, and he's not a bad option if you are looking for a fast moving college arm. It's also not like he's completely devoid of upside at 6'4'', 200 pounds, so there is certainly room to tack on a MPH or two on the fastball. I could have gone with any of the names in the just missed section over Holman, as they all have similar value to me, but why not highlight a fresh name rather than guys who I've been writing about for years now. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.12/1.32/128 in 150 IP

906) Trey Gregory-Alford LAA, RHP, 18.11 - Selected 322nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, but signing for $1.96 million, Alford has the size and stuff to match that big signing bonus. He's a built up 6'5'', 235 pounds with a mid 90's fastball that has been up to 101.4 in a bullpen session, which he combines with a potentially plus, but still developing slider. It's a reliever profile as is with below average control and without a third pitch, but he'll still be just 18 years old on Opening Day, so there is plenty of time for him to refine his arsenal and command. There is obviously a ton of risk here, but the upside is high too. He's likely to be one of the more interesting true upside arms that you will be able to get very late in first year player drafts. At the very least, keep an eye on him early in 2025, because his loud stuff will get people's attention quickly if he's pitching well. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/3.93/1.30/156 in 150 IP

907) Brendan Tunink - LAD, OF, 19.6 - Selected 250th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Tunink is a high upside high schooler drafted by the Dodgers. That is an excellent foundation right there. He's a strong 6'0'', 185 pounds with an absolutely vicious lefty swing that is looking to do damage, and it's a short and controlled swing too. He combines that with plus speed and a good feel to hit. This is a bet on the Dodgers just as much as it's a bet on Tunink. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/17/68/.252/.321/.421/17

908) Jimmy Crooks - STL, C, 23.8 - Crooks is likely headed to a backup role at least early in his career, and he has a lot of competition at catcher in St. Louis' system (although a trade can clear that up very quickly), but he has the skills to be interesting in deeper leagues. His strong glove gives him a leg up as many of the catchers on this list are iffy to stick at the position, and it's not like he's chopped liver on offense either. He just handled his business at Double-A with a 156 wRC+, 11 homers, and a 21.0/11.6 K%/BB% in 90 games. He has a good feel to hit, a good approach, and he can hit it hard at 6'0'', 230 pounds. It just seems like he would be the perfect backup to Ivan Herrera, but even there he has very real competition. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 48/13/56/.251/.323/.403/3

909) Ramon Ramirez - KCR, C, 19.10 - Ramirez was a popular DSL breakout target last off-season, and while his numbers fell off in stateside rookie ball, he still had a good season, slashing .265/.379/.459 with 7 homers, 1 steal, and a 20.7/12.8 K%/BB% in 49 games. He has a strong, quick and athletic righty swing that mostly certainly passes the eye test, and he has the big pop to back that up. There is hit tool risk, he's been on the old side for the level the past 2 seasons, and there is no guarantee he sticks at catcher, but he has plenty of development time to go, and his impressive swing/power potential makes him an exciting young prospect to at least keep an eye on. What he does in full season ball will swing his value in a major way in either direction. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 62/21/69/.246/.318/.440/3

910) Rainiel Rodriguez - STL, C, 18.3 - Rodriguez is the top catcher breakout coming of the DSL, slashing .345/.462/.683 with 10 homers, 1 steal, and a 13.6/16.3 K%/BB% in 41 games. It was good for a 186 wRC+. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'10'', 197 pounds, but he hits the ball very hard and the plate approach was excellent. 5'10'' DSL catchers aren't exactly my favorite targets for fantasy, and he's not a lock to stick behind the plate, but those numbers are hard to ignore. He's definitely a candidate to be a top catcher prospect in a few years if he keeps progressing. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 66/18/73/.260/.335/.438/1

911) Simeon Woods Richardson - MIN, RHP, 24.6 - Back end arm with an average to below average 4 pitch mix and average control. Zebby and Festa are better than him, but it seems Minnesota is going to roll with SWR. 2025 Projection: 7/4.16/1.32/125 in 140 IP

912) Chris Paddack - MIN, RHP, 29.2 - Back end up arm with double plus control, an above average fastball, and 4-pitch mix, but none of the secondaries are good. Seems to have a hold on the 5th starter job. 2025 Projection: 6/4.28/1.31/107 in 120 IP

913) Marcus Stroman - NYY, RHP, 33.11 - Stroman looks to be a pure back end starter at this point in his career with a 4.31 ERA and 16.7/8.9 K%/BB% in 154.2 IP. He cracks list this because he does have a long track record of being solid, and he's not ancient quite yet. But don't buy the name value here. - 2025 Projection: 10/4.28/1.32/1200 in 150 IP

914) Eduardo Rodriguez - ARI, LHP, 32.0 - A shoulder injury delayed the start of Rodriguez' season until August, and he was terrible when he returned with a 5.04 ERA and 21.0/8.5 K%/BB% in 50 IP. He throws 5 pitches and none of them are particularly good, he doesn't miss many bats, and the control isn't particularly great either. He's a back end arm at this stage of his career. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.27/1.33/129 in 140 IP

915) Travis d'Arnaud - LAA, C, 36.2 - I'm not sure d'Arnaud deserves to crack this list as a 36 year old backup, but assuming no decline he's possibly the best back up in the league, and the Angels didn't just pay him $12 million over 2 years to not play him. He's coming off a season where he put up an above average .322 xwOBA with a 89.9 MPH EV, and 15 homers in 99 games. If O'Hoppe gets hurt, d'Arnaud will certainly be relevant, and even if he doesn't, I don't see why the Angels would sign him if they weren't going to find ways to get him in the lineup. - 2025 Projection: 35/13/43/.241/.303/.420/1

916) Gary Sanchez - BAL, C, 32.4 - It seems Baltimore could be intent on using Sanchez as a weak side of a platoon bat, which is actually not that horrible for his fantasy value. The bar to clear for catcher is pretty low, and Sanchez has the power to be relevant when his bat is in the lineup. He's never had a Barrel% below 10.5%, which granted, that is the career low mark he put up in 2024. He's getting up there in age and he was a below average defensive catcher last year, so Baltimore could pull the plug at any moment, but he's worth a flier in deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 32/13/39/.220/.300/.428/0

917) Edward Florentino - PIT, 1B/OF, 18.5 - Florentino is a big dude at 6'4'', 200 pounds, and he signed for a not bad $395,000 in last year's international class. He played a bunch of CF along with 1B, so while his glove isn't expected to be an asset, he could end up a solid corner outfielder. And of course, we are buying the bat here with big raw power and excellent production in his pro debut in the DSL. He slashed .260/.432/.459 with 5 homers, 8 steals, and a 18.9/20.0 K%/BB% in 49 games. He put the ball in the air a ton with a 30.5% GB%. He's setting up to be your classic three true outcome slugger. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/26/83/.246/.328/.453/6

918) Justin Gonzales - BOS, 1B/OF, 18.3 - Like Florentio, Gonzales is a big dude at 6'4'', 210 pounds, and he signed for $250,000 in last year's international class despite limited defensive value. That means the Red Sox liked his bat a lot, and I'm sure they like it even more after his excellent pro debut in the DSL, slashing .320/.391/.517 with 5 homers, 8 steals, and a 10.4/9.9 K%/BB% in 47 games. He hit the ball on the ground too much to fully get to his big raw power, but his contact/power combo is impressive. Obviously so much risk with DSL guys and lack of defensive value, but the upside on the bat is good enough to slot in here. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 74/22/81/.266/.326/.447/6

919) Teilon Serrano - MIN, OF, 16.10 - Betting on Serrano was just as big of a bet on the Dodgers as it was on Serrano, so I can't say I like him as much with the Twins as I did with the Dodgers (the Dodgers had to decommit to him after signing Roki). But I still love me a prospect with such a visually fast and explosive swing at 6'0'', 185 pounds. Combine that with double plus speed and I think he could have some of the best speed first upside in this class. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 83/16/64/.259/.328/.413/30

920) Royel Strop - STL, OF, 16.10 - Strop has baseball bloodlines with his father, Pedro Strop, just finishing his MLB reliever career in 2021. And now his father is turning to the training/coaching game as he coached his son, Royel, to be one of the best international prospects in the class. Strop is a strong and still projectable 6'1'', 165 pounds, and he has a controlled and powerful lefty swing that is geared for both power and average. Tack on plus speed, and you have a very enticing international prospect. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 78/18/69/.265/.328/.426/18

921) Maykel Coret - TBR, OF, 17.6 - Coret has one of the highest upsides in the class at 6'4'', 190 pounds with a potentially plus power/speed combo. The swing is athletic and powerful, and while it's not the shortest swing, I like that he's trying to do real damage. He can already hit the ball very hard. He's also an excellent athlete who certainly looks the part on the field with smooth and explosive movements. If the hit tool is at least solid in the DSL, he definitely has potential to get some real hype very quickly. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/25/81/.254/.329/.453/21

922) Caleb Lomavita - WAS, C, 22.5 - Selected 39th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, taking Lomavita might be an indication that Washington is not locked into Keibert Ruiz as their long term catcher despite Ruiz being under contract until 2032. They are also light on organizational catcher depth, so maybe it has nothing to do with that, but point being, Lomavita could start competing for that catcher job in the next few seasons. And he has enough fantasy upside stemming from his speed to be an interesting deep league option. He stole 12 bags in 55 games in the Pac 12 this year and has stolen 36 in 158 games in his career. He combines the well above average athleticism for a catcher with above average power (15 homers). The downside is that his plate approach is well below average with a 16.7%/4.7% K%/BB%, so he simply just might not be a very good hitter against more advanced competition. And we saw that downside play out in his pro debut with 0 homers, a .213 BA, and a 76 wRC+ in 17 games at Single-A. The 18.3/7.0 K%/BB% wasn't too bad though, so it's not like he was completely overmatched or anything, and he stole 3 bags. He's a deep league FYPD option for a catcher needy team. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 49/14/53/.247/.307/.412/9

923) Andres Chaparro - WAS, 1B, 25.11 - I fear that Chaparro ends up a good but not great short side of a platoon 1B/DH considering the .551 OPS in 87 PA vs righties in his MLB debut, but Washington doesn't have a deep system, so injuries could end up forcing his bat into the lineup even with their recent acquisitions. Chaparro also has a good enough contact/power profile to make a fantasy impact if he does get the playing time. He hit 23 homers with a 17.9% K% in 105 games at Triple-A, and then he held his own in the majors with 4 homers and a 18.2% K% in 132 PA. He doesn't crush the ball, but he hits it hard enough, and he has a lift and pull profile to get the most out of his power. It's most likely a bench bat long term. - 2025 Projection: 21/7/26/.241/.316/.430/1

924)  Jared Serna - MIA, 2B/SS, 22.10 - Serna's stats dropped off when he got to the upper minors, slashing .247/.328/.356 with 2 homers, 4 steals (in 7 attempts), and a 20.7/8.1 K%/BB% in 45 games. He's a small guy at 5'7'' with high ground ball rates, so the power upside is very limited. He has speed, but he started to get caught a lot in the upper minors, and the plate skills dropped off in the upper minors too. He's likely a utility infielder, but the Marlins entire infield is far from locked down, so he's on the right team for opportunity. I still think Miami has better options than him though. - 2025 Projection: 18/2/11/.246/.299/.351/6 Prime Projection: 61/9/42/.262/.323/.388/18

925) Devin Saltiban - PHI, 2B, 20.2 -  Saltiban was a 3rd round pick in 2023 who immediately hit well in pro ball. He put up a 124 wRC+ in 10 games at rookie ball in 2023, and then in 2024 he put up a 123 wRC+ with 17 homers, 22 steals and a 24.8/12.2 K%/BB% in 97 games at Single-A. He's not a big guy at 5'9'', 180 pounds, but he's got a quick righty swing and he can lift and pull it a bit. The 86.2 MPH EV isn't too bad for his age, and the 9.7% Barrel shows the power production wasn't a fluke. He also has speed and is a good baserunner, going 22 for 24 on the bases. If the strikeout rate was a bit better, I could see being even higher on him, but I'm a fan. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/17/71/.253/.325/.417/23

926) Mikey Romero - BOS, 2B/SS, 21.3 - Here is what I wrote about Romero in the in-season Dynasty Rundowns towards the end of the season, and my thoughts remain the same: "The Red Sox 1st round pick, 24th overall, in 2022 has been almost completely ignored by everyone, including me, but Mikey is demanding our attention right now after calmly jacking out his 4th homer in 7 games since getting called up to Double-A as a 20 year old. He had 10 homers in 59 games at High-A. The reason he has been ignored is because he doesn't have big raw power, he doesn't have speed (1 steal all season), and his hit tool/plate approach isn't particularly good either with a 21.9/5.0 K%/BB% in 60 games overall. Those deficiencies still make me pretty lackluster on his future potential, but production matters, and the guy is no doubt producing while being super young for the level. Maybe he can lift and pull his way into like Connor Norby type territory." ... He closed out the season at Double-A with 6 homers and a 33.8/2.7 K%/BB% in 16 games. That K rate is scary, but he was just 20 years old getting a taste of the upper minors. It was much better at High-A with a 21% K%. He's getting no love, but the guy was picked 24th overall, he reached Double-A by 20 and showed he can do damage against upper minors pitching. I don't think he's a major dynasty asset either, but show the guy just a little bit of love, will ya. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/17/71/.245/.303/.412/3

927) Cooper Kinney - TBR, 2B, 22.2 - Kinney was the 34th overall pick in 2021 and then missed the entire 2022 season with shoulder surgery. He's just been kinda slowly plodding through the minors since with good but not eye catching production. He slashed .289/.352/.494 with 10 homers, 6 steals, and a 22.2/8.9 K%/BB% in 87 games at High-A this year. It was good for a 137 wRC+. Being 21 years old at High-A is fine, but it's one year older than optimal, and nothing really stands out in his game. He has good size at 6'1'', 200 pounds, and he has a sweet lefty swing, which are the things that got him drafted so highly out of high school, but without a standout tool/skill, he remains kinda lukewarm for fantasy. If he can keep up the production at Double-A, that will give him a bump, and there is definitely potential for a power breakout if he can start to lift and pull more. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 65/18/71/.261/.318/.414/6

928) Vaughn Grissom - BOS, 2B, 24.3 - Despite Grissom's hype in previous years, he's settled in as a pretty unexciting player. He looks like a utility infielder who will need a legitimate power uptick in his mid 20's to end up as anything more than that. He was very rough in the majors in 2024 with a 28 wRC+, 0 homers, and 2 steals in 31 games. He wasn't all that good at Triple-A either with a .259/.385/.373 triple-slash in 55 games. He just hits the ball super weakly with a 86.1 MPH EV in the majors and a 85.3 MPH EV in the minors. He's not fast either with a 27.4 ft/sec sprint, and the contact rates are good, but they aren't great with a 21.1% K% in the majors and a 19.2% K% in the minors. He's also not that good on defense. He's 6'2'', 210 pounds, so he theoretically has the size to add more power, but "looking the part" can only get you so far. You need to produce, and Grissom just isn't producing. - 2025 Projection: 18/2/14/.251/.318/.391/5 Prime Projection: 74/14/68/.268/.333/.409/12

929) William Bergolla Jr. - CHW, 2B/SS, 20.5 - I really liked Bergolla's hit/speed/bloodlines combo in his international signing year, and while the hit was most certainly there with elite contact rates, he wasn't running at all. That changed this year with him stealing 27 bags in 33 attempts at High-A. He combined that with a 10.6/8.1 K%/BB%, a .300 BA and a 114 wRC+ in 89 games as a 19 year old. He truly has special contact ability. There is absolutely zero power in here with 1 homer in his entire 168 game career, and he's a small guy without much raw power, so he isn't going to grow into much more either. It's likely a utility infielder profile, but those contact rates are elite, and if he hits his way into the lineup, he should steal enough bases with it to be interesting for fantasy. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/7/38/.283/.332/.371/23

930) Cameron Cauley - TEX, SS/2B, 22.2 - Every year that Cauley doesn't improve the hit tool makes it less likely that it's ever going to really happen. He once again put up a 29.2/8.4 K%/BB% in 93 games at High-A, which just isn't going to get the job done. But he remains on the back of this list because he's a true talent. He's lightning fast with 27 steals in 29 attempts, and he has both raw and game power with 12 homers. He also has a potentially plus up the middle glove. His glove and pure talent should eventually get him on an MLB field, but it's likely a case where the hit tool isn't good enough until his mid to late 20's, if it ever gets good enough at all. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 51/14/46/.226/.300/.415/23

931) Jakob Christian - SFG, OF, 22.6 - Selected 149th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Christian is 6'5'', 225 pounds with big power and good athleticism. I love betting on a big dude who is also a good athlete, and while Christian has plenty of flaws, there is plenty to like for fantasy. He's done nothing but rip homers in his college career starting from his freshman year, crushing 67 homers in 160 career games. He definitely has hit tool risk, but a 20% K% isn't too bad, and he was good in his pro debut, slashing .267/.378/.500 with 1 homer and a 21.6/13.5 K%/BB% in 9 games at Single-A.. He's a high risk, high reward power hitting college bat. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 58/16/66/.233/.301/.429/6

932) Kavares Tears - SDP, OF, 22.7 - Selected 134th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Tears is proven SEC power bat with hit tool risk. He's a strong 6'0'' with a powerful lefty swing that is made to do damage. He cracked 20 homers in 71 games at Tennessee. He's also a good athlete with some speed, and while he's not a huge base stealer, he should still contribute a handful. The problem is that it came with a 25.3% K%, and while the 15.4% BB% mitigates that a bit, it's still not good. His bat has a high bar to clear as a mostly corner outfielder, and you can see by him getting drafted 134th overall, teams aren't fully convinced he can clear it. He's still worth the shot late in first player drafts if you want a good college bat rather than a 17 year old mystery. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/18/74/.240/.314/.420/7

933) Wilfri De La Cruz - CHC, SS/3B, 17.6 - De La Cruz certainly looks the part at a very projectable and relatively broad 6'2'' with a smooth lefty swing that is geared for both average and power. The righty swing isn't as smooth, but you can see he's trying to drive the ball with that one too, not just slap it. He's known to have a good feel to hit and a solid plate approach, but it seems likely to me that this will end up power over hit at peak. He's also a good athlete who should at the very least contribute in steals as he fills out, and maybe more than that. Feel to hit/approach, size, athleticism, projection ... that is basically what you look for in an international prospect. De La Cruz is a good one. - ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 77/23/79/.257/.338/.449/12

934) Alejandro Cruz - CHW, 3B, 18.3 - Cruz will already be 18 years old when he enters pro ball, which is a bit on the older side for the international class, although he's from Cuba and they don't seem to stick with that 17 year old timeline that other areas mostly do, so I wouldn't hold it against him too much. He's already a relatively imposing 6'3'', 180 pounds, and it certainly looks like he could end up being a real bruiser at the dish at peak. He's fast too though, so maybe he keeps a more a athletic physique to keep his speed. These are the type of guesses you have to make when talking about such young players. No matter how his body fills out though, his righty swing is damn fast and it's quick and short too, so he could have a pretty potent hit/power combo if it all comes together. Tack on that speed, and Cruz has plenty of upside to be a fun late FYPD lotto ticket. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 72/21/76/.253/.326/.438/14

935) Harold Rivas - BOS, OF, 16.11 - Rivas is visually super explosive at the dish with an athletic and powerful righty swing that definitely has power potential as he continues to fill out his 6'2'', 170 pound frame. He's also a plus runner who plays a good CF. The hit tool isn't bulletproof, and he's not necessarily the broadest guy, but he's on the young side for the class, so who knows how his body ends up. Either way, he's got the power/speed combo we like for fantasy, so the upside is definitely in here. - ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 74/18/63/.248/.313/.427/22

936) Diego Tornes - ATL, OF, 16.9 - Tornes is one of the youngest players in the class but he's also already one of the most physically mature at 6'4'', 200 pounds. This is a big boy already with big boy power from a quick and powerful swing. He's a switch who hits better lefty than righty, and he's a good athlete despite his already impressive size. He has some of the best power upside in the class. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/25/83/.250/.320/.450/9

937) Rafael Flores - NYY, C/1B, 24.5 - Flores' power took a big step forward in 2024, and it resulted in him destroying Double-A, slashing .274/.359/.519 with 15 homers, 6 steals, and a 26.7/10.3 K%/BB% in 65 games. He also so easily passes the eye test at 6'3'', 220 pounds with a smooth righty swing that looks like an MLB swing. I mean, his offensive power upside is no joke. He's already 24 years old, the hit tool has risk as you can see from that strikeout rate, and he's not a particularly good defensive player, but it's so easy to fall in love watching his swing. I like him, but a bench bat is probably his most reasonable outcome. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/18/65/.241/.317/.437/3

938) Manny Cedeno - NYY, SS, 16.8 - Cedeno is one of the youngest players in the class (you are drafting a full child here basically), but you already see the seeds of a grown man righty swing that can potentially punish baseballs. His righty swing is powerful and fast, and he makes it look easy. He also has one of the best hit tools in the class and is a good athlete. He's currently 5'11'', but I guess at his age he could easily grow more, which would make him even more dangerous. I like him. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 72/23/81/.268/.333/.451/9

939) Cristopher Polanco - TOR, SS, 17.3 - Polanco has one of, if not my favorite pure swing in the class. It is a super sweet and smooth lefty swing that is easy and under control. And when he wants to put his back into one, he can really crank it with that same smooth motion. I love it. He's not a particularly big guy at 5'11'', 180 pounds, but I think he's going to have the ability to hit the ball pretty hard at peak, and he's already known for a good hit tool. If he was a bit bigger, I would really love him, but even at his size I think he can be damn good. I'm a big fan. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/18/74/.277/.346/.429/16

940) Nieves Izaguirre - PHI, SS, 17.3 - Izaguirre is Acuna's cousin, so how could I leave him off this list. He's more Luisangel than Ronald though, but that ain't bad either as I like Luisangel a lot. Like Luisangel, he's not a big guy, but he has a big righty swing that looks pretty damn electric, and he combines that with a good hit tool and speed. I think he can definitely follow in Luisangel's footsteps. Don't expect Ronald's footsteps though. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 81/14/57/.266/.331/.388/28

941) Conrad Cason - BOS, SS/RHP, 18.8 - Selected 237th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for $1.25 million, Cason is a two way player whose future is likely on the mound. He was a multi sport star as well, so this is a guy who can do just about anything athletically at a high level, and the hope is that when he finally focuses fully on one thing, he can really thrive. That one thing seems to be pitching as his fastball already sits mid 90's and can touch upper 90's, to go along with a changeup that flashes plus and a solid slider. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with an athletic delivery, and while all areas of his game still needs refinement, he's still just 18 years old. If pitching doesn't work out, he can give hitting a go with plus speed, above average power potential, a good glove, and decent hit tool. He also needs refinement in all areas of his hitting, so that is why it seems his pitching is a bit farther ahead, and where the most upside lies. You are basically drafting the athlete here, and seeing where the chips fall, just like the Sox did. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.13/1.29/141 in 150 IP

942) Niko Kavadas - LAA, 1B, 26.6 - Kavadas is likely a very low BA, bench power bat, but his power is huge enough, and he's close enough to the majors to crack this list. It's not hard to envision him becoming fantasy relevant if injuries hit, because the guy will rip dingers. He smoked 17 homers with a 92 MPH EV and 18.8 degree launch in 83 games at Triple-A, and then he hit 4 homers with a 91.7 MPH EV and 27.3 degree launch in 30 MLB games. He had a 33.4% K% at Triple-A and a 38.7% K% with a .183 BA in the majors, so the BA will tank you. He walks a ton though with a 17.3% BB% at AAA and 10.4% BB% in the majors, so in deep OBP leagues, he definitely has a chance to be useful. - 2025 Projection: 23/8/26/.208/.309/.416/0

943) Daniel Susac - OAK, C, 23.11 - Susac was the 19th overall pick in the 2022, and with how many former first round catchers leveled up in 2024, it's not hard to see Susac taking that same path when he's in his mid to late 20's. He put up a solid season at Double-A with 12 homers, 7 steals, and a 103 wRC+ in 88 games. It came with a terrible 25.9/4.3 K%/BB%, and while he improved his launch this season, he's still not a huge launch guy. He's 6'4'', 218 pounds with a big and powerful righty swing, so he has legit raw power, and he's a solid defensive catcher. Maybe he can become fantasy relevant in like 2028. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection:  45/15/58/.236/.291/.417/5

944) Ben Williamson - SEA, 3B, 24.5 - I was scratching my head on why so many people were so hyped up for Williamson last off-season, and to their credit, a 146 wRC+ at High-A and a 114 wRC+ at Double-A is good, but he was already 23 years old, and the .272/.365/.374 triple-slash with 3 homers and 15 steals in 95 games at Double-A is not very fantasy friendly. He hit 4 homers in 124 games all season. He doesn't lift, he doesn't pull, and while the hit tool is solid, it's not standout. This still isn't my type of profile, especially hitting in Seattle, but considering the solid year at Double-A and the solid glove, it's possible he could be a solid real life bat at peak. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/12/58/.256/.325/.392/9

945) Sammy Stafura - CIN, SS, 20.4 - I know that I go on and on about pro debuts, but Stafura is a good example of someone who had a terrible pro debut and then turned it around the next season. After putting up a 7 wRC+ with a 43.4% K% in 12 rookie ball games in 2023, he then hit pretty well in full season ball in 2024, slashing .270/.387/.412 with 8 homers, 31 steals, and a 24.7/15.2 K%/BB% in 92 games at Single-A. I give respect where it's due, and his value definitely rose from last year, but he's still not really all that enticing of a prospect, so I don't think the poor pro debut rankings drop led you in the wrong direction. The 85.9 MPH EV was low and the 24.7% K% was high. That's not a great combo, and he's really not all that electric of an athlete at 6'0'' with good but not great athleticism. It's just not that unique or enticing of a profile. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/16/63/.251/.325/.412/23

946) Aroon Escobar – PHI, 2B, 20.3 – Here is what I wrote about Escobar in the latest Rundown: "I generally hate players who are “old” for their rookie ball leagues. These include 18 year olds repeating the DSL and 19 year olds in stateside rookie ball, but with the recent contraction of the minor leagues, I might have to loosen up my stance on that. With fewer teams, more deserving guys are going to repeat rookie ball levels, and on the flip side, Single-A is getting more rookie ball-ish itself. High-A might really be the true “full season ball” jump that Single-A used to be. It’s something to keep in mind, and something that I have to continue adjusting to myself. Enter Aroon, who destroying rookie ball as a 19 year old with a 172 wRC+, 3 homers, 9 steals, and a 9.6/20.2 K%/BB% in 24 games. I wasn’t in on him because of his age, but I’m feeling regret for that after he crushed him first homer this spring at a grown man’s 108.2 MPH. He now has a 505 wRC+ in 2 PA ;). He’s not necessarily a big tools guy, which is another reason I wasn’t in on him, but he can end up a very strong across the board contributor. He deserved more respect from me." ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/15/69/.269/.333/.421/16

947) Griff O'Ferrall - BAL, SS, 22.2 - Selected 32nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Baltimore followed up their super risky pick of Honeycutt, with a super safe pick of O'Ferrall. Griff is a low upside college bat without much power, so while the real life profile of up the middle defense, contact, and some speed is enticing, it's less so for fantasy. He hit only 5 homers in 63 games in the ACC this year, and he hit only 8 homers in 186 career college games. He didn't hit a single homer in his 20 game pro debut in the lower minors. He did make a lot of contact with a 14.4% K% and he ran a bit with 2 steals in 6 attempts. The deeper the league, the more enticing he becomes, but even in deeper leagues I'm not super excited. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/9/58/.268/.324/.392/21

948) Daiber De Los Santos - MIN, SS, 18.6 - De Los Santos was a big time international prospect, signing for $1.9 million, and he went out and proved he deserved that money in his pro debut, slashing .301/.384/.460 with 5 homers, 17 steals, and a 31.0/8.9 K%/BB% in 47 games in the DSL. He's an excellent athlete at a projectable 6'1'' with a powerful and athletic righty swing to go along with plus speed. He also lifted and pulled a ton, so he should get the most of his raw power. The big red flag is obviously the 31% K%, which is way too high for the DSL especially. He's a very high risk, very high reward DSL breakout. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 70/23/76/.238/.309/.438/19

949) Walker Janek - HOU, C, 22.7 - Selected 28th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Janek was the first catcher taken in the draft, but he's known more for his defense than his offense. He has an excellent glove and excellent arm, so there is zero doubt that he sticks behind the plate. The only question is how much offense he will provide with an average hit/power combo at 6'0'', 190 pounds. He has hit for both average and power all 3 years of his college career in the WAC and CUSA with 37 homers and .325 BA in 166 games, and maybe most notably, he's done the same in the wood bat Cape Cod League with 5 homers and a .281 BA in 30 games. But he had an awful pro debut with 1 homer, a 29.1/3.9 K%/BB% and 42 wRC+ in 25 games, which really dampens any excitement I might have had for him. I'm projecting him as a light hitting, defense first catcher, and Yainer Diaz isn't a free agnet until 2029. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 42/14/51/.235/.306/.402/5

950) Johan De Los Santos - PIT, SS, 17.5 - De Los Santos is the brother of Yordany De Los Santos, who went through this process only a few years ago and also signed with Pitt. Yordany was one of the first misses for this SS list, but his younger brother cracks it, because the name of this game is finding the lotto ticket that pays off big, not the one you have to hold for 7 years in order to get a utility infielder out of it (not saying Yordany is doomed to that fate, it's just the long and slow development process is not what you are looking for when you draft a 17 year old). De Los Santos could easily end up in the same bucket as his older brother, but his bonus is expected to double his brother's, so maybe he has a cleaner path in pro ball too. His lefty swing definitely looks the part. It looks super natural with both feel to hit and the intent to do damage. As he adds more strength at 6'0'', 175 pounds, the hope is that the power comes. And like most of these kids, he has a good feel to hit and speed. He's pretty electric though, and that electricity does stand out a bit amongst his peers. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/17/68/.258/.319/.413/24

951) Jose Pena - BAL, SS, 16.8 - I can't find any video of Pena, probably because he has such a common name, which is a shame because it seems like he could be someone I really like. I will keep an eye out though and I'm sure I'll find a video that pops up eventually, in which time I could change his ranking here. He's one of the youngest players in the class and has one of the best frames at a projectable 6'2'', 155 pounds. He supposedly swings a quick and explosive bat (which I haven't seen) and he's fast. I know you could say that seeing a few swings isn't that big of a deal, but I don't know, I've had a ton of success picking out my favorite international prospects based on watching their swings and movements, so without seeing that, I can't really say he's a target for me yet. I'm just going to keep my eye out for that video, which I know is clearly out there somewhere. I just can't find it. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 78/18/72/.260/.320/.425/28

952) Ayden Johnson - OAK, SS, 17.2 - It's always a little crazy to me watching some 14 year olds workout video and evaluating them for dynasty baseball, hah, but here we are, and Johnson put together a fire training video. He also shows a body transformation of going from a chubby kid to ripped. At one point his trainer says, "Can you believe this kid is just 14 years old?" ... hah, and I mean, you can't help but laugh and say, "no." ... but I'm just being tongue in cheek, I already talked about not going down that path of disbelieving everyone's age. It is what it is. He already speaks perfect English, which I guess is considered a good thing? Does that really matter though? I'm not so sure. Okay, on to things that really matter, which is that he has a ton of the traits you look for in a hyped international prospect. He's a rock solid 6'2'', 180 pounds with a quick and powerful righty swing that should have plenty of power potential at peak. He's also a good athlete and has a good feel to hit. And he's quite clearly a hard worker. It seems to me his future is as a power hitting bruiser if it all works out. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/24/79/.259/.324/.456/9

953) Ty Southisene - CHC, SS, 19.9 - Selected 120th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signed for $1 million, Southisene is a small guy at 5'9'', 160 pounds, and he's on the older side for the class, but Chicago didn't pay him over slot for nothing. He's the quintessential little man discount as he's raked and been a standout performer everywhere he's been. There isn't much power potential in the bat, but he has a potentially plus hit/speed combo which can certainly be impactful for fantasy. Utility infielder is probably the most likely relatively good outcome scenario, but if you love betting on the underdog who just keeps on raking while not getting enough love (although he just made one million dollars at 19 years old, so he's doing just fine ;), that's Southisene. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/9/48/.268/.323/.372/24

954) Jose Perdomo - ATL, SS, 18.6 - Perdomo received the highest signing bonus in the international class at $5 million, but unfortunately he was limited to just 8 games in the DSL due to a hamstring injury. He didn't do much in those 8 games with a 66 wRC+, but the 18.2/9.1 K%/BB%, 37.5% GB%, and 2 steals all look fine, so basically the sample is too small to say anything. We have to give him a mulligan and run it back in 2025. He's known for his excellent hit tool with the ultimate power/speed combo still in some question. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but it seems he's trending towards power over speed right now. There is plenty of time for him to change his body in multiple ways, so we'll see which way he decides to go. I'll split the difference for now and assume it will end up a hit tool first profile with a moderate power/speed combo, but there is still so much mystery here. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 78/18/72/.268/.327/.429/15

955) Didier Fuentes - ATL, RHP, 19.9 - The 18/19 year old Fuentes had a phenomenal season at Single-A, putting up a 2.74 ERA with a 32.1/6.9 K%/BB% in 75.1 IP. He also has the stuff to back it up with a heavily used mid 90's fastball that can miss bats, a potentially plus slider, and a developing changeup. He's not a particularly big guy and there are definitely some reliever traits here, but I respect the age, production, stuff, and organization. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.97/1.26/144 in 150 IP

956) Victor Lizarraga - SDP, RHP, 21.4 - Lizarraga cracks this list on the back of his youth and build, because the present stuff and performance isn't too impressive. He's a relatively filled out 6'3'' with an athletic righty delivery that put up a 4.03 ERA and 25.1/10.3 K%/BB% in 96 IP at Double-A. The curve is his best pitch and is potentially plus, but that is really his only plus attribute. The fastball sits low 90's, the changeup is still developing, and the control is average-ish at best. He's was only 20 in the upper minors, which makes his season more impressive, but he needs to improve his velocity, control, and/or third pitch to be more than a back end guy. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.25/1.33/130 in 150 IP

957) Brian Holiday - STL, RHP, 21.10 - Selected 80th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Holiday is a small and athletic righty with a plus control profile. He put up a 2.95 ERA with a 28.6/4.2 K%/BB% in 113 IP in the Big West. The fastball only sits in the low 90's, but it's a bat missing weapon because of it's movement profile from a low release point. He also mixes in three secondaries (slider, curve, change) with his slider being his best swing and miss secondary. There could be some little man, and low velocity discrimination going on here, so there might be some more upside in here than he gets credit for. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 9/4.05/1.26/138 in 150 IP

958) Ethan Anderson - BAL, C/1B, 21.6 - Selected 61st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Anderson cracks this list more on the back of how weak of a catcher class it is in first year player drafts this year. I have to grade the position on a curve, and while staying away from it completely even in deep leagues is reasonable, it's nice to know your best options. Anderson is one of those options after raking all 3 years he's played in the ACC with a good feel to hit and good pop. He hit .341 with 28 homers in 178 career minor league games, and then he stepped into pro ball and kept on producing there too. He put up a 125 wRC+ in 14 games at Single-A and a 155 wRC+ in 5 games at High-A. He's a switch hitter and he's young for the class, two things that can portend a bit more potential than a typical college selection, and he's got good size at 6'2'', 215 pounds with a swing geared towards lift. There is no guarantee he can stick at catcher, but there are definitely things to like about Anderson. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 55/14/55/.263/.329/.411/4

959) Jacob Cozart - CLE, C, 22.3 - Selected 48th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Cozart is a big dude at 6'3'', 222 pounds, and he has the big lefty swing and plus power to match. He cracked 19 homers with a 1.038 OPS in 61 games in the ACC. The hit tool was considered a risk coming into the draft, and that unfortunately played out in his pro debut with a 36.7% K% and 26 wRC+ in 13 games at High-A. He's not a bad defensive player who has a chance to stick behind the plate. He has the upside to be a classic low BA, slugging catcher, but it might take until his mid to late 20's for him to realistically have a shot at reaching that ceiling with a full time job. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 46/15/54/.227/.301/.418/0

960) Gabriel Davalillo - LAA, C, 17.5 - Francisco Alvarez is really the very easy and perfect ceiling comp here with an almost identical profile. Davalillo is a 5'11'', 215 pound bull with plus power, but the hit tool isn't bulletproof and neither is his defense at catcher. He's the top international catcher in the class, and he has real power, but considering I already don't love rostering a bunch of catcher prospects in dynasty, Davalillo has enough warts to make me hesitant to really fly him up the rankings. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 66/22/78/.252/.321/.443/3

961) Bryce Meccage - MIL, RHP, 19.0 - Selected 57th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Meccage is similar to Josh Knoth, who Milwaukee took 33rd overall in 2023, so they clearly have a type. And Milwaukee has done well with pitching development, so they are a good team to bet on. Meccage is 6'4'', 210 pounds with a low to mid 90's fastball, two breaking balls (slider, curve), and a developing changeup. He can spin all of his pitches, like Knoth, and he has a solidly athletic right delivery with a good idea of where the ball is going. Not the flashiest profile, but there is plenty to like. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/4.02/1.27/160 in 160 IP

962) Drew Beam - KCR, RHP, 22.1 - Selected 76th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Beam is a floor over upside college starter who should move through the system quickly. Plus control is his best attribute, putting up a 6.5% BB% in his 262.2 IP college career in the SEC, and he was throwing strikes the second he stepped on campus as a freshman. He also most certainly looks the part at an athletic 6'4', 208 pounds. The career 3.60 ERA and 22.7% K% isn't as impressive as the size and walk rates, and his stuff is more in the average to above average category than truly standout with two 94 MPH fastballs, a curve and a changeup. It's a #4 upside type profile, as you can see from falling to 76th overall in the draft, and the lack of strikeouts subdues his upside for fantasy too. The deeper the league, the more value he has. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.21/1.29/130 in 150 IP

963) Emelien Pitre - TBR, 2B, 22.6 - Selected 58th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Pitre is a lower upside infielder who is probably a better real life prospect than fantasy, but that's not to say there is no fantasy intrigue. He's 5'11'' with some room to tack on a bit more mass, and he had a power breakout his junior year with 10 dingers in 62 games in the SEC (1 was his previous career high). A strong plate approach and speed is what you are buying, and that immediately transferred to pro ball, slashing .299/.402/.403 with 0 homers, 7 steals, and a 12.0/13.0 K%/BB% in 21 games at Single-A. He can hit the ball hard, but it's geared more for all fields line drives, so there isn't big upside in here. He likely profiles as one of Tampa's many moving parts, part time players down the line. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/10/51/.262/.323/.393/15

964) Aiden May - MIA, RHP, 21.11 - Selected 70th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, May has that quick, fast moving delivery that has the look of guy that is hungry to attack hitters and is confident in his stuff. And I get it, because he has really good stuff with a 94 MPH sinker that can keep the ball on the ground to go along with a legitimately nasty, plus slider and a lesser used changeup. It all led to a 3.05 ERA with a 27.0/7.4 K%/BB% in 73.2 IP in the Pac 12. It's probably a back end or a reliever profile, but if he can develop the changeup, or improve his control/command, he could beat that projection. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.34/126 in 140 IP

965) Joshua Kuroda-Grauer - OAK, SS, 22.2 - Selected 75th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Grauer has been a contact machine everywhere he's played, putting up a .428 BA with a 7% K% in 53 games in the Big Ten his Junior year, and then stepping right into pro ball and doing the same with a .324 BA and 7.1% K% in 28 games at Single-A, High-A, and Triple-A. Even the fact he made it to Triple-A shows how fast Oakland thinks he can contribute. He combines the elite contact rates with speed (5 steals in pro ball and 24 steals in college), a solid plate approach, and decent hard hit ability. He won't hit many homers with very high groundball rates (5 homers his junior year and 0 homers in pro ball), but he doesn't need to aim for homers with his profile. He's probably best suited for a utility role on a good team, but his contact/speed profile can definitely make an impact if he works his way into an everyday job. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/7/42/.268/.327/.376/19

966) Ethan Schiefelbein - TBR, LHP, 19.0 - Selected 72nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Schiefelbein makes this list mostly because Tampa drafted him, because I trust them to develop his pitches to match his already excellent pitchability. His delivery reminds me of Cole Hamels as a 6'2'', 180 pound lefty (Hamels was two inches taller than him, and much better than him, obviously), and he's known to have some of the best command in his class. The fastball only sits low 90's and he doesn't necessarily have any electric secondaries (slider, curve, change), but he'll rip off some sweet looking curveballs. If he gains velocity and just refines his pitches all around, there is real elite command type upside in here. And why not trust the Rays. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 9/3.96/1.22/139 in 150 IP

967) Landen Maroudis - TOR, RHP, 20.3 - Maroudis was looking really good in his 10.2 IP pro debut at Single-A before going down with an elbow injury that required an internal brace surgery in May. The puts his likely return date at some point mid-season, which could be enough time to get the hype rolling again. He had a 0.84 ERA with a 31.6/10.5 K%/BB%. The fastball sat 93.6 MPH, the curve and change got whiffs, and the slider induced weak contact. He also throws a sinker. He's not the type I love taking the "Tommy John" discount on, but I think he's worth a shot this late in the rankings as he was on a clear upward trajectory before going down with the injury. If he returns to full health, I don't see why he can't pick up from where he left off. Major elbow surgery is just part of the pitching prospect journey. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.98/1.27/160 in 155 IP

968) Ben Lively - CLE, RHP, 33.1 - Lively is a junk balling, kitchen sink back end starter who had basically the best year you can hope for for this type of guy with a 3.81 ERA and 18.7/7.8 K%/BB% in 151 IP. He throws 6 pitches, and while none are very good, none are very bad either. The fastball only sits 90.4 MPH. He's also already 33 years old. It's a classic back end starter. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.15/1.29/110 in 140 IP

969) Kyle Wright - KCR, RHP, 29.6 - After years of struggles, Wright finally broke through in 2022 and learned how to harness his very good stuff, so of course all of that got wiped out with a shoulder injury in 2023. He injured his shoulder that spring and had a terrible season trying to fight through it with missed time, diminished stuff and poor results (6.97 ERA with a 92.7 MPH fastball in 31 IP). He then succumbed to shoulder surgery in October 2023 and missed the entire 2024 season. I guess you can scoop him and hope for a full return to his 2022 version, but he’s not really all that enticing to me in anything but deep leagues. He's not even guaranteed a rotation spot. Pure flier. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.31/1.34/89 in 100 IP

970) Jack Perkins - OAK, RHP, 25.3 - Perkins is most likely a reliever long term, but he's in the right organization to get as long of a leash as possible. He has a potentially plus fastball/slider combo with below average control, which is a classic reliever profile. But it was good enough to dominate Double-A with a 2.88 ERA and 32.1/10.9 K%/BB% in 78 IP. He also throws a cutter, curve, and changeup, so it's not like he's a purely two pitch pitcher, but those are much lesser used pitches. He's already 25 years old, and Oakland does have a bunch of similar options, so it's not clear what number he is in the pecking order. I'm betting on reliever, but the K upside and possible opportunity is good enough to crack this list. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.11/1.32/33 in 35 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.74/1.25/69 in 65 IP

971) Joe Boyle - TBR, RHP, 25.8 - Boyle is very likely a bullpen arm after putting up a 6.42 ERA with a 24.8/17.7 K%/BB% in 47.2 IP, but Tampa executives talked about being extremely patient with a high upside arm like this, so I'll give Tampa one year to see if they can work their magic. The fastball sat 97.7 MPH and the breaking balls are whiff machines, so if Tampa can bring the control/command down to just below average, maybe, just maybe he can end up a high K, mid rotation starter. I would still bet on bullpen, but you never know. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.88/1.32/72 in 65 IP

972) Franyerber Montillo - DET, 2B/SS/3B, 19.11 - I'm not sure Montillo deserves to crack this list after how hard he struggled once he got the call to Single-A. He was already 19 years old, so seeing him put up a 42 wRC+ with a 31.6% K% in 20 games is not a good sign. He looked really good in rookie ball with a 136 wRC+ and above average across the board production, but those numbers don't look as impressive after the immediate drop off at the more age appropriate Single-A. The reason he does crack this list though is because I just like the look of him at the plate. He's a pretty electric player at 6'0'' with some power and athleticism. He can also lift and pull it, so he should be able to get the most out of his power. And he's walked a ton in his career, even at Single-A with a 15.2% BB% at that level. I'll give him a pass for the struggles in full season ball because it's not like he was ancient at a relatively recently turned 19, and regardless of age, there is an adjustment period humans often have to make to tougher levels, new teams, cities, coaches etc ... Hard to say he's too sought after of a prospect, but there is something here that I definitely like a lot when watching him. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/17/66/.250/.330/.418/18

973) Kyle Isbel - KCR, OF, 28.1 - Isbel should be a 4th outfielder, but KC doesn't have any other good options, so he seems like the main guy for the CF job. He's an above average CF, but he's not even that good there where his glove needs to get him on the field. And he's a bad hitter with a 81 wRC+ in 136 games, and a 77 wRC+ in his 361 game career. He's not a big base stealer either with only 11 steals in 2024, so you can't even bank on that. He has a job, and that is about it. - 2025 Projection: 54/7/46/.236/.294/.375/12

974) Javier Sanoja - MIA, OF/SS/2B, 22.7 - Sanoja can play basically every position on the field, and Miami's corner outfield spots are pretty wide open, so there seems to be plenty of opportunity for him to rack up at bats. He had elite contact rates in the minors which transferred to the majors with a 11.1% K% in 36 PA, and he's got speed with a 28.7 ft/sec sprint and 17 steals in 126 games in the upper minors. He doesn't hit the ball hard (84.6 MPH EV in the minors), and as you saw from that steal total, he doesn't really run enough for this type of profile. He's a utility player on the vast majority of teams, but with Miami, he's liable to get 500+ PA. - 2025 Projection: 38/4/36/.245/.297/.338/12

975) Josh Kasevich - TOR, SS, 24.3 - Kasevich is a hit tool/defense play, which doesn't excite me for fantasy, but he hits the ball hard enough, and runs just enough to remain kinda interesting. And unlike some other fringy prospects on the Jays, his glove might actually get him on the field. The hit tool is damn good with a 11.8% K% and .296 BA in 128 games in the upper minors. He put up an 89.6 MPH EV at Triple-A, which is pretty good, and he was 13 for 14 on the bases with solid speed. The deeper the league, the more value he will have, but if the hit tool transfers to the majors, he could end up having value in most league sizes. - 2025 Projection: 9/1/10/.259/.305/.357/2 Prime Projection: 73/9/58/.276/.323/.382/11

976) Robert Hassell – WAS, OF, 23.8 - Hassell hasn't lived up to his draft promise as the 8th overall pick in the draft, and now it seems likely that he's a 4th outfielder. After putting up an 85 wRC+ at mostly Double-A in 2023, he followed that up with a 87 wRC+ in 2024 at mostly that same level. He doesn't hit for power (5 homers), he doesn't steal a ton of bases (15 steals in 85 games), and the contact rates aren't that great either (21% K%). He cracks this list for pedigree and proximity. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 44/8/39/.242/.311/.389/13

977) Grant McCray - SFG, OF, 24.4 - McCray is really testing the limits on how much I lean power/speed over hit tool. That hit tool is as brutal as it gets with a 43.1/4.6 K%/BB% in 37 games, and I just can't overlook that. He's an elite athlete with a 29.2 ft/sec sprint and an 11.8% Barrel% (90.2 MPH EV), which led to 5 homer and 5 steals in those 37 games, but even I can't just gloss over the hit tool risk. Then tack on ballpark risk and the fact he's not a big launch guy, and I just can't get behind this. He's an upside true last pick flier. - 2025 Projection: 29/7/26/.218/.284/.395/9

978) Max Schuemann - OAK, SS/3B, 27.9 - Schuemann is a super utility player who has some fantasy friendly skills with speed (14 steals in 459 PA), lift (16.6 degree launch) and OBP (10.2% BB%), and Oakland has an open-ish job at 3B, so he can easily rack up a ton of at bats in 2025. The hit tool is the biggest issue with a 25.9% K% and .220 BA. He lifts it a lot, but he doesn't pull it enough with a 36.4% Pull%, and the 91.8 MPH FB/LD EV isn't great, so that is a recipe for a very low BA. The 89 MPH AVG EV and 5.6% Barrel% isn't bad though, so he definitely has some pop (7 homers). He's 27 years old and the K rates and hit tool were a problem even in the minors, so I don't think his supporting skills are good enough to overcome the at least below average hit tool. But if the hit tool can improve, and/or he finds his way into everyday at bats, he can definitely end up fantasy relevant. - 2025 Projection: 46/8/35/.227/.309/.366/13

979) Gio Urshela - OAK, 3B, 33.5 - Urshela is as low of a win now option as it gets, but he could open the season as Oakland's starting 3B, so he cracks this list. He can get the bat on the ball with a 15.6% K%, and he has a solid glove, and that is about it. There are already rumors that Max Muncy will be competing for that job, and I'm sure they hope Muncy will win it. But if he doesn't, Urshela will be rolled out there. - 2025 Projection: 42/10/53/.265/.303/.395/1

980) Jadher Areinamo - MIL, 2B/SS/3B, 21.4 - Areinamo is probably a utility infielder long term with one of the wackiest swings I've ever seen. I imagine if they ever drew Micky Mouse playing baseball, they would have him swing something like Areinamo. It's amazing that he has elite contact rates with that swing, but he does with a 11.1% K% and .301 BA in 110 games at High-A. He doesn't have big raw power with only 10 homers at 5'8", and he's not a burner despite 32 steals, so I don't think his fantasy value is huge. But if the elite contact rates stick in the upper minors, he'll be interesting for deeper leagues. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/9/42/.268/.321/.387/16

981) Dillon Head - MIA, OF, 20.6 - Head's season ended after just 26 games due to a hip injury that required surgery. He wasn't all that impressive before the injury either, slashing .243/.317/.396 with 2 homers, 5 steals, and a 24.4/8.1 K%/BB% at Single-A. Considering he's supposed to be a hit/speed guy, neither the contact rates nor the stolen base totals are where you wanted them to be. He was a first round pick in 2023 and I liked him a lot coming out of the draft, so I don't want to completely write him off, but this was a rough start to his career. He needs to prove himself in 2025 to start climbing back up the rankings again. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 61/10/53/.251/.319/.406/16

982) Seth Brown - OAK, 1B/OF, 32.9 - Brown is in a strong side of a platoon role, but I think his time is coming up on even that. He's not a good defensive player, he's going to turn 33 during the season, and he put up his 2nd straight season with a 91 wRC+. That isn't a starter. He still hits the ball hard with a 90 MPH EV, which can keep him relevant, but the contact rates and plate approach are poor. It's time to give the kids a shot. - 2025 Projection: 35/12/41/.228/.290/.419/4

983) Jonah Bride - MIA, 1B, 29.3 - McBride was Miami's starting 1B/DH in the 2nd half of the season, and despite putting up a 123 wRC+ with 11 homers in 71 games, and despite him currently penciled in for the job, I'm not buying. His .297 xwOBA and 87.1 MPH EV tell a different story, and with a mediocre 11.8 degree launch, it's not like there are going to be a ton of homers. The 20.2/11.0 K%/BB% is solid, but the .224 xBA shows you can't count on a high BA either. He's a bench bat at best. De Los Santos is going to take that 1B job possibly from opening day. - 2025 Projection: 31/9/36/.243/.317/.410/1

984) Griffin Conine - MIA, OF, 27.8 - Conine seems to have a path to playing time in Miami at the moment, although he'll have plenty of other fringy competition, and he can definitely hit some dingers if given the opportunity. He cracked 19 homers with an 89.9 MPH EV in 112 games at Triple-A, and then he cracked 3 homers with a 114 wRC+ in 89 PA in the majors. He got lucky in the majors with a .289 xwOBA, the hit tool is terrible (31.5/6.7 K%/BB%) and he's already 27 years old, so he's a bench power bat at best. But as long as he has opportunity, he deserves to sneak on this list. - 2025 Projection: 29/10/34/.220/.297/.409/1

985) Matt Mervis - MIA, 1B, 26.11 - Quad-A slugger who might win the Marlins 1B job just out of desperation. He'll pop some homers and probably nothing else, but sometimes these Quad-A guys do breakout when they get the chance, and Mervis is getting the chance. 2025 Projection: 40/13/49/.218/.291/.392/0

986) Pedro Leon - HOU, OF, 26.10 - Leon cracks this list basically solely for that 77.8 MPH swing in his MLB debut. And also for the 24 homers and 29 steals in 118 games at Triple-A. And also for the opportunity in Houston's OF. He's 26 years old and the hit tool probably isn't good enough to be a starter with a 27.0/8.1 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 47.6% K% in 21 PA in the majors, so he's merely a deep league flier. - 2025 Projection: 16/4/13/.210/.283/.374/6 Prime Projection: 33/8/36/.222/.298/.391/8

987) Bo Davidson - SFG, OF, 22.9 - Davidson put up a 173 wRC+ in 53 games at Single-A, but considering he was already 21/22 years old, it isn't quite as impressive. He can hit the ball hard at 6'1'', 205 pounds, leading to 9 homers at the level, but a 48.4% GB% and 35.5% Pull% isn't conducive to big homer totals long term, and neither is his eventual home ballpark. He's not a great base stealer (6 steals in 9 attempts), and the 23.9% K% is on the high side. He's a good athlete who can play CF, and he comes from the Junior college level, so maybe there could be some more developmental upside than his age would indicate. I'm just not seeing big fantasy upside here, but that doesn't mean there is nothing to like. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 55/14/55/.252/.321/.418/8

988) Dedniel Nunez - NYM, Setup, 28.10 - Nunez' season ended in August with a forearm injury, and Roster Resource doesn't even have him making the team, but his profile is too bulletproof not to get excited by him. Minter is getting long in the tooth a bit, and Nunez could very easily end up the clearly 2nd best option in their bullpen. He put up a 2.31 ERA with a 35.6/5.9 K%/BB% in 35 IP. The slider was elite with a 45.3% whiff% and .189 xwOBA, and the 96.3 MPH fastball put up a respectable 25.2% whiff%. He was dominant at Triple-A too before getting the call, and while there have been some bouts of wildness, he's had generally solid control on the whole. This is just a case of betting on the talent and letting the chips fall where they may. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.30/1.16/80/0 saves in 60 IP

989) Michell Otanez - OAK, Setup, 27.9 - Otanez probably isn't next in line to the closer job, but he's too fire to keep off the list. He put up a 2.49 xERA, 3.44 ERA, and a 36.4/13.2 K%/BB% in 34 IP. The 98 MPH fastball is an insane bat massing machine with a 39.2% whiff%, and so is the slider with a 52.2% whiff%. The control is horrible, and he's had high ERA's in the minors, so he's still just an upside play on the back of the list. - 2025 Projection: 3/3.72/1.32/90/0 saves in 61 IP

990) Emilio Pagan - CIN, Setup, 33.11 - Cincy is a good spot to save chase, and while they have a lot of options if Diaz loses the job, Pagan will be one of them. He wasn't that good in 2024 with a 4.50 ERA and 27.8/7.0 K%/BB%, but everything more or less looks to be within career norms (career 3.78 ERA). He has the best combo of being a righty and strong track record out of the non Diaz options. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.90/1.28/65/5 saves in 60 IP

991) Gus Varland - CHW, Closer Committee, 28.5 - Varland doesn't have the whiff rates of Chicago's other options with a 24.5% whiff%, but he has the control edge with a 7% BB%, and maybe that ends up winning the day considering the volatility of the other options. He was solid in 2024 with a 3.42 ERA and 23.5% K% in 26.1 IP. Maybe he ends up the guy. Who knows. - 2025 Projection: 3/4.10/1.33/65/2 saves in 65 IP

992) Pierce Johnson - ATL, Setup, 33.11 - Johnson is likely next man up in Atlanta, and while he's not great, he has the strikeout upside to crack the list. He put up a 3.67 ERA with a 28.4/10.6 K%/BB% in 56.1 IP. He does it with an above average fastball/slider combo. If Atlanta had other better options, I might not have put him on, but they don't seem to right now. Maybe Hurston Waldrep emerges as their closer of the future though. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.88/1.32/72/6 saves in 60 IP

993) Derek Law - WSH, Setup, 34.7 - He put up a 2.60 ERA with a 20.8/6.6 K%/BB% in 90 IP. His walk rates have been below average throughout his career, so it's hard to trust that 6.6% BB%, and his K rates have always been below average. The 28.6% whiff% is actually good, and he's always gotten whiffs, but they don't translate to K's. The stuff is good with mid 90's heat, a bat missing slider, and a good cutter, so he very well could end up their most reliable guy. - 2025 Projection: 4/3.78/1.31/54/5 saves in 65 IP

994) Nathan Martorella - SDP, 1B, 24.1 - Italian Snack couldn't keep up his production in the upper minors with a 104 wRC+ in 127 games at Double-A, and with a 1B bat like this, that is basically a death knell for his prospect status. Your bat needs to be bulletproof. But he still displayed a solid hit/power combo with 18 homers and a 18.2/9.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, so he'll get the most out of his above average raw power, and there is opportunity in Miami. He's only a deep league option right now though. - 2025 Projection: 15/3/17/.243/.302/.381/1 Prime Projection: 38/10/41/.258/.320/.425/3

995) Hector Rodriguez - CIN, OF, 21.1 - Rodriguez generally hits everywhere he's been, and while he hit well again this year, it was a bit more underwhelming with a 106 wRC+, 12 homers, and 12 steals in 125 games at High-A. He's not a big guy at 5'10'', and while the 13.3% K% is excellent, the 4.8% BB% isn't. He's likely a utility player long term. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/10/51/.262/.313/.395/10

996) Gabriel Gonzalez - MIN, OF, 21.3 - Gonzalez had an underwhelming year in 2024, slashing .255/.326/.381 with 5 homers, 5 steals, and a 14.5/6.8 K%/BB% in 81 games at High-A. The contact rates were still good, but the power/speed numbers were very lackluster, and as a maxed out corner outfielder, it's not looking like a starting profile right now. He's hit for more power in the past, and he gets the bat on the ball, so I want to give him one more year before dropping him off this list. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 48/13/56/.257/.320/.417/4

997) Samuel Zavala - CHW, OF, 20.8 - Zavala was a straight disaster in 2024, slashing .187/.340/.301 with 8 homers, 14 steals, and a 22.3/17.8 K%/BB% in 111 games, but I don't want to write him off completely quite yet. He's always been very young for the level, and he continued to show the mature plate approach that was his bread and butter. He's 6'1'', 175 pounds, so there is room for him to tack on more muscle, and he doesn't have any issues lifting and pulling it. Simply getting stronger and playing against people his own age could go a long way. I'm giving him one more year. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 56/13/49/.248/.324/.412/9

998) Ching-Hsien Ko - LAD, OF, 18.7 - The Dodgers signed Ko mid-season like they did with Hyun-seok Jang the year before, which kept the hype in check, but they signed him for $750,000, so they obviously like him. He only played in the 9 games in the DSL, but he played well in those games with 1 homer, 1 steal, a 17.5/27.5 K%/BB%, and a 150 wRC+. He was a strong international performer as well in tournaments, so there is some history of production here. And he most certainly looks the part at 6'3'', 215 pounds. He profiles as a potentially big power hitter with a strong plate approach, but clearly he has a lot to prove. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 74/23/77/.255/.335/.445/7

999) Juan Sanchez - TOR, SS, 17.7 - Sanchez is another one I can't find video on (see Jose Pena above too), again probably because his name is just too common, but I will continue to keep my eye out and I'm sure I'll find some eventually. He definitely has the build and tools you are looking for though at 6'3'', 200 pounds with power and speed. That's a big boy with athleticism. When I find the video, I will add more. Not much more I can say until then. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 71/23/79/.245/.317/.448/10

1000) Larry Suero - COL, 2B/3B, 17.0 - Suero is 6'2'', 182 pounds with a sweet lefty swing, a good feel to hit, and good athleticism. Signing with Colorado is a double edged sword, as you get their ballpark at the end of the road, but you also get their poor development on the way to that. There isn't a ton of video out there on him, and he seems probably 14/15 years old in the video I have seen, but even the younger version of him had an athletic and sweet lefty swing, so it's not hard to envision legit offensive upside at 6'2''. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/22/79/.268/.334/.447/10

1001) Raymer Medina - TBR, SS, 17.5 - The thing that stands out about Medina to me is that the ball jumps off his bat from a very controlled and powerful swing from both sides of the plate. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but he's got the right kind of strength/thickness, and he definitely packs a punch with that swing. I think more power is coming, which he can combine with a good feel to hit and athleticism. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/20/77.255/.316/.433/12

1002) Warel Soriano - TBR, SS, 17.7 - Soriano has a vicious righty swing that is fast and made to do damage, which is what I love to see from these prospects, and he's also fast and projectable at a skinny 6'0'', 165 pounds. It's so hard to say how these kids are going to mature and end up physically, but there is definitely a path for him to develop a truly impact power/speed combo down the line. It's not like he's 6'3'', so I'm not going to say it's super high upside, but this is definitely an upside pick, and the hit tool is solid too. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 71/22/77.251/.314/.442/16

1003) Trey Snyder - NYM, SS, 19.6 - Selected 144th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for $1.32 million, the first thing that jumps out about Snyder is how much bat speed he can generate from such a simple swing, and at a solid 6'2'', 195 pounds, there is power behind it too. The swing is more geared for average than power right now, but he has plus speed too, so that profile can work even if he doesn't try to lift and pull more down the line. He made his pro debut in 2024, and while he didn't perform well with a 58 wRC+ in 6 games, he was thrown right into Single-A, and the 23.1/15.4 K%/BB% was actually pretty encouraging. He has the potential to be a solid across the board contributor. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 79/16/61/.264/.329/.416/18

1004) Ronny Cruz - CHC, SS, 18.8 - Selected 90th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft and signing for an under slot $620,000, Cruz is 6'1'', 170 pounds with a big righty swing that has power potential written all over it. The swing mechanics are still raw, there is hit tool risk, and he's not a burner, so I wouldn't necessarily circle him as a later round target right now, but he's young for the class, and the Cubs popped him relatively early, so they obviously like him even if part of the reason was the under slot bonus. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 71/23/78/.244/.317/.441/8

1005) Juan Cabata - CHC, SS, 16.11 - Luis Pena of the Brewers is what you hope that Cabata can duplicate in 2025. He has one of the best hit tools in the class with a very smooth, easy and fast lefty swing. He's not a big guy at 5'11'', 165 pounds, so power likely isn't going to be a big part of his game, but the hope is that it can get to average. And he's got some speed and base stealing ability. He could be one of the top hit/speed combo coming out of the DSL if things go right. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/14/59/.266/.325/.412/23

1006) Brayan Cortesia - WSH, SS, 17.4 - Cortesia hit a growth spurt of late, which yes, that is what boys do from the ages of 13 years old to 16 years old ha, growing to 6'1'', and those extra inches gives him that added boost of upside to combine with his good feel to hit, good glove, and plus speed. If the power really starts to come down the line, there is potential for him to be a complete prospect, and his righty swing definitely looks the part (quick, powerful, athletic, launch). - ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 79/18/69/.266/.326/.423/24

1007) Ramcell Medina - KCR, SS, 17.5 - Medina has a perfect combination of refinement, history of production, and now size/projection. He's grown to 6'2'', 180 pounds, and he looks pretty damn physical in the box already. He could end up with real power to go along with an advanced feel at the plate and solid athleticism. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 77/22/77/.262/.334/.434/7

1008) Juan Tomas - CHC, SS, 17.4 - Tomas has that prototypical build you are looking for at a projectable 6'3'', and he's a switch hitter with a quick and powerful swing from both sides of the dish. He has that Alonso Soriano type athleticism, and like Soriano, he has the potential for an impact power/speed combo if it all comes together. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/20/74/.250/.318/.436/20

1009) Darwin Ozuna - OAK, OF, 17.0 - Ozuna has big time power upside at a broad and still projectable 6'3'', 195 pounds with a powerful righty swing that already does damage. He's a good athlete but he's not a burner, and there are some hit tool questions, so it's a power first profile with some risk. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 68/23/77/.245/.317/.446/8

1010) Ian Seymour - TBR, LHP, 26.4 - Seymour is likely a back end arm with that classic plus changeup, low velocity profile, but Tampa is known to work magic, so he might have a chance to end up at the high end of this profile type. He put up a 2.35 ERA with a 28.1/7.1 K%/BB% in 145.1 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A (he dominated both levels equally). The fastball only sits 90.7 MPH, but it put up a 32.4% whiff% at Triple-A, and the changeup is at least plus with a 45% whiff%. The cutter and slider are useful pitches too which can induce weak contact. The control is solid, but it's been below average at points in his career, and you probably really have to count on plus control to maximize this profile. - 2025 Projection: Prime Projection: 10/4.19/130/149 in 160 IP

1011) Troy Melton - DET, RHP, 24.4 - Melton put up a 5.10 ERA in 100.2 IP at Double-A, but the 27.2/7.0 K%/BB% ad 3.14 xFIP is much more indicative of how he really pitched. He's a big guy at 6'4'', 210 pounds with a decently athletic delivery, a mid 90's fastball, and a starters pitch mix. It might not be the highest upside, but he's a rock solid pitching prospect who is definitely on the underrated side. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.11/1.28/134 in 145 IP

1012) Connelly Early - BOS, LHP, 23.0 - Early certainly looks the part at 6'3'', 195 pounds with an athletic lefty delivery, and he has the production to match with a 3.99 ERA and 30.8/8.7 K%/BB% in 103.2 IP split between High-A and Double-A. The stuff doesn't necessarily blow you away with a low to mid 90's fastball, but the changeup can be a legit plus pitch, and he also throws a slider and curve. He's already 23 years old, and it's likely a back end starter profile, but there is enough here to crack the list. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.21/1.30/136 in 145 IP

1013) Nestor German - BAL, RHP, 23.1 - German put up a 1.59 ERA with a 31.4/5.9 K%/BB% in 73.2 IP at Single-A and High-A. With numbers like that, it's not hard to see why he's getting a lot of sleeper buzz this off-season, but he's not really one of my guys. He's a big guy at 6'3'', 225 pounds, but the delivery really isn't all that athletic. It's definitely reliever=ish to me. The stuff is good, but it's not really great with an average to maybe above average traditional 4 pitch mix. And he's never shown this level of control on the college level. I'm just not too blown away when watching him, and it makes me not want to put too much weight on an advanced college arm who is fully physically mature beating up on lower minors hitters. It's not like he's all that expensive, and I respect a K/BB like that no matter what, so I get the love, but he's not one my guys. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 8/4.29/1.32/128 in 140 IP

1014) Josh Knoth – MIL, RHP, 19.8 - Knoth was a favorite of many last off-season in FYPD's (including me), and while he didn't have a particularly great year, his value held serve with a 4.48 ERA and 26.6/11.1 K%/BB% in 84.1 IP at Single-A. The mid 90's fastball is a potentially plus pitch and bat missing weapon, which he pairs with a potentially plus slider. He also mixes in a curve and change. There is obviously more refinement needed all round, but he's still only 19 years old, and Milwaukee is a good organization to trust for pitcher development. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 11/3.91/1.29/165 in 160 IP Update: Underwent Tommy John surgery which will keep him out for all of 2025

1015) Blaze Jordan - BOS, 3B/1B, 22.3 - I wasn't sure Jordan deserved to crack this list with his 2nd straight year of poor performance at Double-A (98 wRC+ in 89 games), but that 12.1% K% is still pretty impressive. He has good raw power despite hitting only 7 homers, and being 21 years old at Double-A is still on the slightly young side. He doesn't have much defensive value, but he can play a decent 3B, so it's not like he doesn't have any at all. I doubt he finds a role on the Red Sox, but I'll take a shot on his contact/power combo at this point in the rankings. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/18/76/.266/.315/.421/3

1016) Nick McLain - CHW, OF, 22.4 - How could I not put little Matty McLain's little brother, Nicky McLain, on this list. The McLain's are not big people (Nick is also 5'10''), but they are damn good baseball players. Nick was selected 78th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft coming off a very productive college career in the Pac 12. He slashed .342/.457/.663 with 12 homers, 6 steals, and a 11.7/14.4 K%/BB% in 48 games his junior year. He's not quite as good of an athlete as his brother with an average power/speed combo, and he's a corner outfielder, so if he wasn't a McLain, he might not have cracked this list. But plus bloodlines matter, and he has then. And he also has a good feel to hit. So I wouldn't bet against him becoming a solid all around baseball player, it just might come as a bench bat. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 65/14/59/.258/.319/.413/8

1017) Yasser Mercedes - MIN, OF, 20.5 - Mercedes destroyed stateside rookie ball with a 163 wRC+, but he was already 19 years old, and when he got to the age appropriate Single-A, he fell apart with a 37.5% K% and 41 wRC+ in 10 games. It's fair to give him more time to adjust to a new level regardless of age, and he's a toolsy prospect with power (6 homers in 61 games overall) and speed (21 steals) at 6'1'', 175 pounds. He's a mid 20's breakout type prospect. It's going to be a slow burn, but the upside is worth a spot at the back of the rankings.  ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 58/14/58/.234/.306/.418/16

1018) Casey Saucke - CHW, OF, 21.8 - Selected 107th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Saucke was a big time major conference performer his entire career, culminating in a junior year where he slashed .344/.407/.578 with 14 homers, 9 steals, and a 18.2/9.5 K%/BB% in 62 games in the ACC. He also  looks the part at a rock solid 6'3'', 210 pounds with a pretty athletic and controlled righty swing. He's a corner outfielder, and the bat probably isn't going to be good enough to clear that bar, which is why he lasted until 107th overall, but the size and production are there, so there is some potential here to become an impact fantasy bat if it all works out. He's also very young for the class, and he hit decently at the age appropriate High-A with a 110 wRC+, 2 homers, 2 steals, and a 26.3/6.1 K%/BB% in 24 games. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 41/12/46/.238/.301/.413/5

1019) Gage Miller - MIA, 3B/2B, 22.1 - Selected 92nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Miller was a standout Junior College player in his freshman and sophomore years, and then he transferred into the SEC and kept on raking, slashing .381/.474/.702 with 18 homers, 0 steals, and a 24/27 K/BB in 55 games. If he had a good pro debut, I could see liking him more, but his debut was rough, slashing .240/.305/.298 with 0 homers, 2 steals, and a 16.9/5.9 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. He's not a particularly toolsy guy and he's not particularly physical at 6'0'', 200 pounds. His strong amateur production and decent draft slot gets him on the list, but he's not a very interesting fantasy prospect right now. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 45/12/45/.253/.318/.402/4

1020) Eli Lovich - CHC, OF, 19.7 - Selected 332nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft but signing $650K, Lovich has the size (6'4''), projection (a skinny-ish 185 pounds), and athleticism (above average speed) you look for in an enticing fantasy prospect. He can already hit the ball hard, and while the swing isn't really all that smooth or pretty, it's definitely fast and powerful. There could be hit tool issues in here, but there is upside as well. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 62/16/66/.244/.315/.426/7

1021) JP Sears - OAK, LHP, 29.1 - Sears has plus control with a 6.5% BB%, and that is it. He doesn't miss bats, he doesn't induce weak contact, and none of his pitches are really standout. The 91.9 MPH fastball is solid I guess. I'm not sure he deserves to be on this list. - 2025 Projection: 10/4.33/1.28/140 in 170 IP

1022) Tyler Anderson - LAA, LHP, 35.3 - I was going back and forth on whether Anderson deserved to crack this list as a 35 year old coming off a season where he put up a 18.6/9.5 K%/BB% (albeit with a 3.81 ERA), but his excellent 27.8% whiff% convinced me to put him on. That is an impressive whiff% on the back of his changeup (39.6% whiff%). It still doesn't result in strikeouts, and he might not deserve to crack the list, but that's why he's on. - 2025 Projection: 9/4.21/1.30/130 in 160 IP

1023) Michael Lorenzen - KCR, RHP, 33.3 - Lorenzen put up a 3.31 ERA with a 1.24 WHIP in 130.1 IP in 2024, so I guess he deserves to crack this list, but I'm not buying at all with a 4.59 xERA and 18.1/11.0 K%/BB%. He's a back end arm and he's 33 years old. He's begrudgingly on the list. - 2025 Projection: 8/4.05/1.29/115 in 140 IP

1024) Kenta Maeda - DET, RHP, 37.0 - He's looking spry this spring and could win that 5th starter job, but the injury risk is high and he hasn't had an under 4.23 ERA since 2020. Just a low end option. 2025 Projection: 6/4.25/1.30/118 in 120 IP

1025) Griffin Canning - NYM, RHP, 28.11 - Here is what I wrote about Canning in the latest Dynasty Rundown, "3.2 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 5/0 K/BB vs. a 50/50 Cardinals lineup. The fastball only sat 92.6 MPH, but it was a whiff machine with a 44% whiff%. The changeup was dominant too with a 38% whiff% and 77.8 EV against. It led to a 35% whiff% overall. Canning was one of my favorite pitching targets in 2024, but he literally showed none of the things I liked about him. He's showing off those things this spring, and maybe this is a case where you are just a year late on the breakout, but I'm still struggling to truly buy in. He's still just a flier for me, but with the banged up Mets rotation, he's not the worst flier." 2025 Projection: 7/4.32/1.35/115 in 130 IP

1026) Jose Quintana - MIL, LHP, 36.2 - He found a starting job with Milwaukee. He has a career 3.74 ERA and he's coming off 3 seasons with sub 4 ERA's. The upside is low, but he can still be a solid pitcher. 2025 Projection: 7/4.05/1.30/100 in 130 IP

1027) Mitch Spence - OAK, RHP, 26.10 - Back end starter with above average control and that is about it. He showed a velocity increase in spring which could give him an upside boost that he desperately needs. 2025 Projection: 8/4.33/1.33/130 in 150 IP

1028) Jack Kochanowicz – LAA, RHP, 24.3 – Here is what I wrote about Jack in the latest Rundown: "The most boring pitcher alive keeps churning out good outings, going 4 IP with 0 hits, 0 ER, and a 2/0 K/BB vs a bad Reds lineup. He now has a 1.00 ERA with a 17.6/2.9 K%/BB% in 9 IP. The K% is at least much better than the 9.4% K% he put in the majors last year, but even that with that 9.4% K%, he still pitched well with a 3.99 ERA in 65.1 IP. It’s all sinker all the time, which is just quite boring, but it’s been undeniably effective for awhile now. He doesn’t seem to have a rotation spot, but I guess he’s not the worst guy to roster in deeper leagues." 2025 Projection: 5/4.18/1.25/70 in 100 IP

1029) Mike Tauchman - CHW, OF, 34.3 - Tauchman seems to have a starting job with Chicago, but he'll have some competition from minor leaguers as the season progresses, so he's far from locked into that job. He does have the hitting talent to hold those kids off though coming off his 2nd straight season putting up a pretty impressive xwOBA. He put up a .345 xwOBA in 2023 and a .330 xwOBA in 2024. The 20.0/13.4 K%/BB% is strong and he hits it pretty hard with a 89 MPH EV. Even in those years the fantasy upside was extremely limited with about a .250 BA, 15 homers, and 13 steals in 751 PA combined, so it's an extremely low end win now option, and he's going to be 34 years old. - 2025 Projection: 53/8/41/.247/.342/.370/6

1030) Zander Mueth - PIT, RHP, 19.9 - Mueth was a favorite of mine in the last off-season FYPD's as a funky righty, but his 2024 wasn't good enough to get too excited here. He put up a 2.31 ERA with a 23.8/15.1 K%/BB% in 74 IP split between rookie and Single-A. The 93.8 MPH sinker keeps the ball on the ground and the slider is a potentially plus bat missing weapon. The control/command was much worse than hoped though, and he needs to develop the changeup more as well. He needs to take steps forward in 2025 to remain on this list, because 2024 was pretty unexciting. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 8/4.27/1.32/133 in 150 IP

1031) Dylan Jordan - LAA, RHP, 19.6 - Selected 143 overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, but signing for $1.25 million, Jordan has prototypical size at 6'3'', 200 pounds, and he has that three quarters arm slot, funky righty delivery which I definitely love, similar to Zander Mueth. It hasn't worked out fully for Mueth so far, but he still has plenty of time. As for Jordan, the fastball currently sits low to mid 90's which he combines with a potentially plus slider, but he needs to improve his changeup and control/command. Back end starter/reliever might be the most likely outcome, but there is obviously so much development time to go. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 8/4.24/1.33/126 in 140 IP

1032) Carson Kelly - CHC, C, 30.8 - Kelly is an above average defensive catcher and he put up an about average offensive season in 2024, so it's possible he ends up the most used catcher in Chicago, even if he is best as a backup. He has above average plate skills with a career 20.4/9.7 K%/BB%, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough to truly be an impact offensive player with a career 6.1% Barrel% (not terrible, but below average). He's a low end option no matter what. - 2025 Projection: 37/9/40/.233/.309/.379/1

1033) Justin Turner - CHC, 1B, 40.4 - Turner has had a very slow and gentle decline, and I gave him a decent rank last year as a 39 year old at 354th overall, but I think this is the year where I'm not too interested even in win now mode. His BA dropped down to .259, and the .252 xBA backs that up. The power was way down too with 11 homers and a career low 87.1 MPH EV in 139 games. The 4.6% Barrel% was also a career low. He still put up a 117 wRC+, which is just a testament to how good he is, but at 40 years old, there is no guarantee he can even find a full time job. Even if he does land one, he's a very low end option. - 2025 Projection: 48/11/48/.265/.340/.430/2 Update: He landed with Chicago where he is likely a bench bat

1034) Juan Valera - BOS, RHP, 18.10 - Valera put up a 2.35 ERA with a 31.1/15.6 K%/BB% in 23 IP at Single-A as an 18 year old. He's already a thick 6'3'' with a mid 90's fastball and a potentially slider. There is a lot of reliever risk here and there is obviously a long way to go, but he has the size, stuff, age to level, and production to be firmly on your radar. He's a candidate to pop in 2025. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 8/4.14/1.32/145 in 140 IP

1035) Axiel Plaz - PIT, C, 19.8 - Plaz put himself on the map with an excellent season in the DSL in 2022, and after a down year in 2023 at stateside rookie, he once again made waves in 2024, this time in full season ball. He smashed 15 homers with a 89.5 MPH EV and 13% Barrel% in 76 games at Single-A. Those are super impressive marks. He's not a huge guy at 5'11'', but his righty swing is athletic and absolutely vicious. The 29.2/11.4 K%/BB% and .207 BA shows the very major batting average risk though. He's a very high risk prospect, but if he can improve the hit tool, that power will get his name spoken more and more in coming years. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 51/18/59/.227/.307/.428/1

1036) Cooper Ingle - CLE, C, 23.1 - Ingle was a low upside college bat who got selected in the 4th round in the 2023 Draft, and while he's still a low upside bat, he's now proven it in the upper minors, slashing .281/.379/.416 with 2 homers, 4 steals, and a 15.5/13.6 K%/BB% in 25 games. There isn't big power or speed and he's not a particularly good defensive catcher. He's likely a backup catcher long term, but if the defense ticks up, and if he can work his way into a starting job, the bat can be solid enough to be fantasy relevant. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 42/9/46/.262/.334/.410/4

1037) Kevin Bazzell - WAS, C, 22.0 - Selected 79th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Bazzell is a hit over power catcher who is new to the position. He played mostly 3B before his junior year, but his bat is only interesting as a catcher, so whether he can stick behind the dish will make or break his profile. His bat to ball skills are impressive, putting up a 10.1% K% in 49 games in the Big 12, and then putting up a 16.7/18.3 K%/BB% with a 148 wRC+ in 14 games at Single-A. He didn't hit a homer in pro ball with a 51.4% GB%, and he hit only 6 his junior year. There isn't big power upside in here, which makes him a safety over upside option. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 37/8/41/.268/.324/.392/3

1038) Stiven Martinez - BAL, OF, 17.8 - The 6'3'', 198 pound Martinez cracked my Top 1,000 last off-season on the back of his impressive power potential, and while there were some positives and negatives from his pro debut in the DSL, the 137 wRC+ is good enough to crack this list again in 2025. He slashed .278/.417/.466 with 4 homers, 2 steals, and a 30.4/16.7 K%/BB% in 41 games. The K rates is too high to go too crazy here, but he's still only 17 years old, and he's an impressive athlete. He's still a high upside lotto ticket. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 67/23/76/.241/.320/.433/8

1039) Robert Arias - CLE, OF, 18.6 - Arias' 102 wRC+ with 0 homers in 41 games in the DSL doesn't jump off the screen, but his double plus speed most certainly does with 29 steals, and so do the elite contact rates with a 8.3/13.9 K%/BB%. He's a projectable 6'1'' with the potential to reach average power at peak, so as the raw power grows naturally, he could end up one of the top contact/speed plays coming out of the DSL this year. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/13/58/.263/.327/.392/29

1040) Jose Anderson - MIL, OF, 18.4 - Anderson was one of the top DSL performers, slashing .283/.403/.512 with 8 homers, 14 steals, and a 18.9/14.4 K%/BB% in 46 games. It was good for a 143 wRC+. He wasn't a high priced international signing, but Milwaukee does absolutely elite work in this market, so you have to trust the organization there, and it's not like Anderson doesn't have talent. He can hit the ball hard, he can lift it, and he can pull it. He's also a good athlete who plays CF and can steal some bags. He's not one of those diminutive breakouts either at a solid 6'0'', 183 pounds. He's one to at least keep an eye on in 2025 as he comes stateside. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 71/18/68/.250/.320/.425/14

1041) Warren Calcano - KCR, SS, 17.6 - Calcano simply checks a lot of boxes as a switch hitting SS with projection (6'1'') and an ease about all aspects of his game. He looks like a natural at the dish and in the field with good athleticism. Nothing really sticks out too much in his profile, but he seems to have a high floor (relative to the international class), and there is definitely some upside in here too. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 78/15/63/.265/.335/.415/15

1042) Elian De La Cruz - ARI, OF, 17.6 - Cruz checks plenty of the international prospect boxes. He's projectable at 6'1'', 180 pounds, he has a quick righty swing, he has a good feel to hit, and he has speed. Nothing particularly stands out too much, but he definitely has the talent to pop with a strong showing in the DSL. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/17/67/.250/.320/.418/18

1043) Carlos Taveras - MIN, OF, 16.10 - Taveras has a smooth and controlled lefty swing that is geared for both power and average, and at 6'1'', 213 pounds, it's not hard to envision a potent hit/power combo at peak. He's also a good runner despite his size, so this is a good athlete too. The swing isn't super explosive and he's not quite as generally explosive as a lot of the other kids in this class, but he's a still a good one. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 81/20/76/.267/.333/.440/10

1044) Carlos Renzullo - COL, 2B/OF, 18.6 - Renzullo is one of the top hit/speed breakouts in the DSL, slashing .360/.455/.447 with 1 homer, 18 steals, and a 6.0%/14.0% K%/BB% in 50 games. There isn't big power here at 5'8'' with high groundball rates, and often with these types the hit tool will just keeping getting a bit worse at every level, leaving them with a pretty lackluster speed and not much else profile. But if you want to take a shot on a DSL contact/speed play, Renzullo is not a bad shot. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 72/9/55/.273/.328/.385/27

1045) Liberts Aponte - CIN, SS, 17.5 - You are hoping for a Starlyn Caba type rise for Aponte. He has a standout glove at SS, so if the contact rates are strong and he steals some bags, the real life hype can be the driver of his value. His BP is pretty unimpressive, but he's obviously young, so if he gets stronger and bigger as he ages, combined with his other skills, there can definitely be some hype coming down the line on the back of the glove. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 73/10/51/.262/.323/.365/21

1046) Kenly Hunter - STL, OF, 16.11 - Hunter has a history of production against international competition, he has a good feel to hit, he's got speed, and he's projectable at 6'0'', 160 pounds. I can't find video on him, but that seems to be a pretty good floor/upside combo, and one worthy of being on the radar. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/15/61/.268/.324/.409/21

1047) Ruben Castillo - NYY, OF, 17.3 - Castillo has a damn smooth and powerful lefty swing that is fun to watch, and while he's not a huge guy, there is definitely power projection at 6'0'', 165 pounds. He also has a good feel to hit and speed, giving him plenty of ingredients to be a quick performer in the DSL. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/18/71/.263/.323/.427/18

1048) Jacob Gonzalez - CHW, SS, 22.10 - Gonzalez cracks this list purely for pedigree (15th pick in the 2023 Draft), glove, and opportunity. Chicago actually isn't that weak in the infield anymore, but that is only theoretical as nobody is established, so Gonzalez should certainly get some opportunities to battle for playing time in the near future. When you take a guy 15th overall, you generally want to give him a look, no matter how mediocre the pro career has been, and it's been damn mediocre. He just put up a .225/.284/.321 triple slash with 5 homers, 10 steals, and a 14.0/6.9 K%/BB% in 94 games at Double-A. He gets the bat on the ball and he has a solid infield glove and that is about it. He's only relevant in probably like 30 teamers, but the opportunity I forsee him eventually getting is why he barely cracks the list. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/12/48/.252/.321/.392/10

1049) Shinnosuke Ogasawara - WSH, LHP, 27.6 - Ogasawara signed a 2 year, $3.5 million contact with Washington, which says it all. He's expected to be a swingman/long reliever in the bigs, but nobody knows for sure if his skills will fully translate or not, so on the chance they do, he cracks this list for mystery alone. He put up a 3.12 ERA with a 13.6/3.7 K%/BB% in 144.1 IP in Japan. He had a 20.2% K% in 2023, so he's capable of better in that department than he showed in 2024. It's a classic plus control, junk baller profile with a low 90's fastball and a multiple of secondaries. He might not have a rotation spot, and he might get bombed in the majors, but I think there is a chance the profile transfers, and he's only 27, so if he does, there could be multiple years of a solid starter. - 2025 Projection: 6/4.27/1.29/88 in 110 IP Update: He looks bad in spring

1050) Damiano Palmegiani - TOR, 3B/1B, 25.2 - Maybe Palmegiani doesn't deserve to crack this list with a 82 wRC+ in 123 games at Triple-A as a 24 year old, but the power upside is in here if he works his way into a shot, which would make him fantasy relevant. He hit 19 homers with an 89.3 MPH EV, 19.4 degree launch, and a 53.6% Pull%. The .210 BA and 28.1% K% is why the wRC+ was so low, and that probably does limit is reasonable upside projection to a bench bat. He's a righty that didn't hit righties that well either (.648 OPS), so it's also a short side of a platoon bench bat. First Base seems especially weak to me up and down the rankings, so he also cracks this list purely on 1B scarcity. - 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.218/.292/.400/0 Prime Projection: 36/12/42/.231/.316/.436/2

1051) Ivan Melendez - ARI, 3B/1B, 25.4 - Melendez' hit tool is not nearly good enough to be an MLB regular with a 30.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 107 games at Double-A, but there is zero doubt this guy will rip dingers if given the chance with 22 homers, a 36.1% GB%, and 51.5% Pull% at 6'1'', 225 pounds. It might come with a BA under the Gallo line, but if you hit dingers, you have the potential to be fantasy relevant. A power bench bat seems to be a good scenario outcome for him. Hitting 30+ homers in a foreign league is another good scenario outcome. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 28/12/34/.219/.299/.428/1
