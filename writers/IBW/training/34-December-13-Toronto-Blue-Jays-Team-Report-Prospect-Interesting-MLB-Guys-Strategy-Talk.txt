Hitters

Bo Bichette - TOR, SS, 27.1 - Bichette is very clearly going to bounce back from a horrendous 2024 where he put up a career worst by a mile .598 OPS. He has a career .798 OPS, he's never had an OPS below .802 before this season, and he's going to be 27 years old. There is no way that he isn't going to bounce back, the only question, is how high will the bounce be, and I don't think it will be high enough to warrant his still pretty high name value price. His 70.4 MPH swing is below average and so is his 27.3 ft/sec sprint. We really aren't talking about a truly electric athlete right now. The 19% K% is above average, but it's not off the charts or anything, the plate approach is bad with a 6% BB% and 37.1% Chase%, the launch is low at 7.2 degrees, and the pull is super low at 28.1%. All of those low marks have been consistent throughout his career (other than the bat speed which we don't have data on), so you can't write that stuff off due to the down season. He's only stolen 10 bags in his last 216 games, so you can't count on big contributions there either. The main thing he has going for him is that he hits the ball hard, but that bottomed out in 2024 with a 4.4% Barrel% and 92.3 MPH FB EV. Just based purely on track record and age, he almost has to bounce back, but I don't see the upside to really bet on it considering his current price (145 NFBC ADP). I'm not buying. - 2025 Projection: 76/18/79/.274/.318/.438/9

Joey Loperfido - TOR, OF, 25.11 - Toronto has a lot of interesting fringy players who are going to Battle Royale it out for playing time. And that battle is sure to go into the season, so predicting who will emerge is quite hard. In most leagues, you probably want to wait to see who emerges, and then try to jump on them quickly, rather than hold any of them, but in deeper leagues, you might not have that luxury. Loperfido is one of those players, and he seems to have the inside track on a large share of an OF role with his ability to play CF (he was an above average CF in his 20 games at the position). His MLB debut was rough due to a 36.3/5.0 K%/BB% that led to a 74 wRC+. He's almost 26 years old and he also had a 28% K% at Triple-A. I'm not saying he can't improve there, but expecting major improvement is probably a low probability outcome. What you are buying is the very real power/speed combo. He's 6'3'', 220 pounds with a 90.8 MPH EV at AAA and a 28.8 ft/sec sprint. It led to 13 homers and 9 steals in just 39 games at the level. It dropped off in the majors with an 88.3 MPH EV, leading to only 4 homers and 4 steals in 81 games, but if he can figure out the hit tool, we know the ability is in there to do much better than that. Considering his age and consistent hit tool issues, he profiles more as a 4th OF, but the fantasy friendly skillset is in here if he gets playing time and makes the necessary improvements. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/51/.226/.302/.412/11

Addison Barger - TOR, 3B/OF, 25.5 - Barger isn't a good defensive player (although he played a good RF last year), which makes it harder for a fringy type like him to get playing time, but out of all of Toronto's fringy players, I want to bet on his bat the most. I've always gushed over his swing, and seeing his near elite 74.3 MPH bat speed just backs up my visual evaluation. That level of bat speed is not to be trifled with, and while he's had some hit tool troubles throughout his career, he's shown improvement there in the upper minors over the last two years. He put up a very respectable 19.3/16.1 K%/BB% in 57 games at Triple-A this year, and he wasn't too bad in the majors either with a 27.6% whiff% and 26.7% K% (albeit with a .239 BABIP fueled .197 BA). As you know from that bat speed, he hits the ball hard with a 90.1 MPH EV at AAA and a 8.7% Barrel% in the majors. The MLB debut was rough with a 70 wRC+ in 69 games, but like I mentioned, some of that was bad luck, and seeing the contact rates not implode is encouraging. He doesn't run a ton, but a 28 ft/sec sprint shows he's a good athlete. He doesn't seem to have a spot right now, but I would hesitate to write him off with that type of bat speed. I'm side eying him. - 2025 Projection: 44/16/53/.238/.314/.428/4

Pitchers

Kevin Gausman - TOR, RHP, 34.3 - Gausman's season had bad news written all over it right when he got popped with a shoulder injury early in Spring. He just wasn't right all season (3.83 ERA with a 21.4/7.4 K%/BB% in 181 IP), and while he was better in the 2nd half (2.90 ERA in final 90 IP), the 19.6/8.6 K%/BB% was not nearly back to prime levels, so that 2nd half does not ease my mind. The velocity was a down a half tick and the elite splitter was more good than elite. You can talk yourself into him getting healthy with a full off-season to heal, but he's 34 years old, and injuries like this are often what prompt the decline phase. His name value and track record is going to keep his value high enough where I don't think he's going to fall into my target area. If your gut is saying that this is a buy low opportunity, I 100% see why you could think that, and don't let me stop you from acting on it. But my gut is saying to not spend the still decently high price on his decline years. Not the worst buy, but just not my guy. - 2025 Projection: 12/3.69/1.20/181 in 178 IP

Bowden Francis - TOR, RHP, 28.11 - Francis was a decently popular sleeper pick this off-season (not by me), and while I bet a lot of people gave up on him Parker Meadows style when he got off to a rough start, hurt his forearm, and then returned in a bullpen role, just like Parker Meadows, he totally redeemed himself by the end of the season. He got re-inserted into the rotation for good in August and put up a 1.53 ERA with a 26.5/3.3 K%/BB% in his final 59 IP. His season numbers were good too with a 3.30 ERA, 0.93 WHIP, and 22.5/5.4 K%/BB% in 103.2 IP. He threw his splitter, sinker, and particularly his slider more in the 2nd half, and threw the curve less if you are looking for real improvements that could make the 2nd half numbers stick. His slider put up a 43.6% whiff%, so smart move throwing that more. And he threw it 3.3 MPH slower than last year, so that could be a real weapon moving forward. His 92.9 MPH fastball doesn't miss a ton of bats or induce particularly weak contact, but it put up a +13 Run Value which was the 16th best in baseball. It was +6 in 2023 as well, so it might not be a fluke there. He doesn't miss a ton of bats in general with a 21.2% whiff%, and he doesn't really induce weak contact with a 8.7% Barrel%, so I'm a little hesitant to buy in too hard, but he made real changes in the 2nd half which could easily carry over into 2025. With a 206 NFBC ADP, it seems everyone is hedging a bit on Francis, and I'm probably in the same camp. His value seems right, and if I had to lean one way, I would lean a buy. - 2025 Projection: 10/3.63/1.18/146 in 150 IP

Toronto Blue Jays Top 10 Fantasy Dynasty Baseball Prospects

1) Orelvis Martinez - TOR, 2B/3B, 23.5 - Martinez got popped with an 80 game PED suspension in June, and I'm honestly struggling to figure out how much to dock him for that. I didn't dock Tatis much for his PED suspension, and that turned out to be a good move. But Tatis was an established MLB superstar already. I then followed suit by not docking Noelvi Marte much, and that looks like a mistake with him possibly being the worst player in MLB last year, dropping off everywhere you look. Martinez clearly fits better into the Noelvi mold than Tatis mold, but everyone is their own person, and I don't want Marte's season to influence Martinez' ranking too much for me. Martinez returned in September and he put up a .882 OPS with 1 homer in 11 games at Triple-A, so that is a good sign that the suspension won't impact him that much. And before the suspension, he was beasting the league with 17 homers, a 13.1% Barrel%, 46.1% Hard Hit%, 23.8/8.5 K%/BB%, and a 120 wRC+ in 74 games. His power is no joke with 30+ potential on the MLB level. Toronto traded for Gimenez, but 3B is still open for the taking, and it wouldn't be crazy to see Martinez win that role pretty quickly into 2025 (pending any off-season moves). I'm going to stay a bit restrained here because of the suspension, but I don't want to be overly scared off. This is a big time power bat who is knocking on the door of the bigs with opportunity. I'm cautiously buying. - 2025 Projection: 36/12/43/.229/.298/.422/1 Prime Projection:  76/28/87/.247/.323/.477/3

2) Arjun Nimmala - TOR, SS, 19.6 - Nimmala got off to a slow start in full season ball, which is completely understandable considering he was only 18 years old, but once he found his footing, he showed why he was one of the most hyped high school bats in his class. He slashed .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers, 5 steals, and a 29.7/6.4 K%/BB% in his last 53 games. He has one of the sweetest righty swings in the game that is tailored made to launch the ball to the moon with a 46.6% FB%. It's powerful too with a 89.1 MPH EV, and at a projectable 6'1'', there is only more power coming. He's also a good athlete who should contribute in steals even if he isn't a huge base stealer. The biggest issue is clearly the hit tool, but you have to give him some leeway for his age, and the upside is high enough to take on that extra risk. I have Nimmala grouped with Brandon Winokur and Eric Bitonti as tooled up power hitting beasts with hit tool risk in the back half of the Top 100 Prospects Rankings. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/28/89/.242/.321/.473/14

3) Ricky Tiedemann - TOR, LHP, 22.8 - Tiedemann underwent Tommy John surgery in late July which will likely wipeout his entire 2025 season. It's definitely a blow to his value, but honestly, with a young flamethrower like this, it should be completely expected. If you jump ship on every flamethrowing pitching prospect you own after undergoing major elbow surgery, you might as well not even draft them (which is a completely viable strategy, although I don't mind taking a shot on one or two). I already used Tiedemann as a trade piece last season in my 12 teamer, as even when I do own them, I don't hesitate to use them in win now deals. That deal netted me 2 years of Will Smith, who helped me secure 3rd place and my money back. Such a fitting lukewarm finish for the lukewarm fantasy player Smith has become. But back to Tiedemann, assuming full health, he has the potential for a plus to double plus fastball/slider combo, to go along with a pretty damn good changeup too. The control/command is below average, so along with the injury, there is certainly a lot of risk in the profile at the moment. Hopefully he can get back on the mound at the end of the season, or even in the AFL, to show the huge stuff is back and to get the hype going into the off-season. He's definitely still a Top 100 Prospect for me, and even that might be selling him too low. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection:  13/3.53/1.21/185 in 165 IP

4) Trey Yesavage - TOR, RHP, 21.8 - Selected 20th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'4'', 225 pound Yesavage has been beating up on inferior competition in the American Athletic Conference for 2 years now, putting up a 2.03 ERA with a 40.4%/8.9% K%/BB% in 93.1 IP in 2024. But he's not just the product of his competition with 3 potentially plus pitches in his mid 90's fastball, hard slider, and nasty splitter. He has weapons to get guys out from both sides of the plate and his control is solid. He likely slid to 20th in the draft because of a collapsed lung that he suffered in May, which I guess does add some unknown long term risk, but all signs seem to indicate that he is okay now. There is definitely potential for him to become an impact mid rotation fantasy starter. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.76/1.22/180 in 170

5) Charles McAdoo - TOR, 3B, 23.1 - McAdoo was a 13th round pick in 2023 who has done nothing but rake in pro ball, slashing .279/.364/.479 with 17 homers, 21 steals, and a 24.7/10.4 K%/BB% in 124 games split between High-A and Double-A. His production was much worse at Double-A than High-A with a .675 OPS in 63 games, which is a bad sign, but that drop off only happened after he was traded to Toronto, so I want to give him some leeway for a major life event (new city, new org, new coaches, etc ...). He's power over hit at a very strong 6'1'', 210 pounds with a powerful righty swing, and he lifts and pulls a ton. He's not a burner, but he's a good athlete. He's going to have to scratch and claw for playing time, and there is hit tool risk, but there is fantasy upside in here if he gets his shot. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.238/.309/.431/9

6) Kendry Rojas - TOR, LHP, 22.5 - Rojas got a decent amount of off-season love in 2024 that I wasn't buying into, and that proved to be a mistake as he leveled up this year at High-A. He had a 2.43 ERA with a 27.0/5.3 K%/BB% in 55.2 IP. He's 6'2'' with an athletic lefty delivery that certainly looks the part. The fastball has ticked up into the low to mid 90's this year which he combines with a plus changeup and good slider. He's a definite candidate to level up again in 2025 if he can stay healthy and build off this season. He has more risk, but I think he has more upside than Bloss, which is why I have him ranked over Bloss. In deeper leagues, I would have Bloss in this spot. - ETA 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.06/1.30/150 in 150 IP

7) Jake Bloss - TOR, RHP, 23.10 - Bloss is your classic likely back end starter with mid rotation upside. These guys are more valuable in real life than fantasy, but if they hit their ceiling, they have good fantasy value. His heavily used 93.4 MPH fastball has a good movement profile, and while it got destroyed in his 11.2 IP MLB debut, leading to a 6.94 ERA and 20.0/5.5 K%/BB%, it was an above average pitch at Triple-A. He throws a diverse 5 pitch mix, and his sweeper stands out the most as a bat missing weapon in both the majors (44.4% whiff%) and AAA (38.5% whiff%). None of his pitches are really standout though, and his control has been average to below average throughout his career. He wasn't all that great in the minors either with a 23.3/9.5 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP. He's just not a particularly enticing fantasy prospect right now. - 2025 Projection: 2/4.51/1.38/50 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.29/1.32/130 in 150 IP

8) Josh Kasevich - TOR, SS, 24.3 - Kasevich is a hit tool/defense play, which doesn't excite me for fantasy, but he hits the ball hard enough, and runs just enough to remain kinda interesting. And unlike some other fringy prospects on the Jays, his glove might actually get him on the field. The hit tool is damn good with a 11.8% K% and .296 BA in 128 games in the upper minors. He put up an 89.6 MPH EV at Triple-A, which is pretty good, and he was 13 for 14 on the bases with solid speed. The deeper the league, the more value he will have, but if the hit tool transfers to the majors, he could end up having value in most league sizes. 2025 Projection: 9/1/10/.259/.305/.357/2 Prime Projection: 73/9/58/.276/.323/.382/11

9) Jonatan Clase - TOR, OF, 22.10 - There were points where I really liked Clase, and only 22 years old, maybe I shouldn't be so quick to cool on him, but the warts in his profile are starting to take forefront in my mind. He doesn't hit the ball hard with an 85.8 MPH EV at AAA and 0 Barrels in his 66 PA MLB debut, and at a small 5'10'', it's hard to expect a lot more there. He's also had contact issues his entire career with a 26% K% at AAA and a 25.8% K% in the majors. And lastly, he has a below average 70.7 MPH swing which is even worse from the left side with a 69.3 MPH swing (the side he swings with more often). He's also not particularly great on defense. He has elite speed and base running ability, which makes him so fun for fantasy, but I think a bench OF is his most likely role. At only 22, maybe he can make improvements to the power, defense, and hit tool, which is why I don't want to write him off completely, but I'm just not too excited by him anymore. - 2025 Projection: 25/3/21/.228/.292/.360/9 Prime Projection: 63/10/41/.249/.319/.391/24

10) Will Wagner - TOR, 2B, 26.8 - Wagner is smack dab in the middle of Toronto's fringy young player clusterf*ck, and while his excellent plate approach and strong MLB debut could put him in the pole position for playing time, he just doesn't have the type of profile I like rostering. He put up a 125 wRC+ in his 24 game MLB debut, but it came with 2 homers and 0 steals. He swings a slow bat (68.9 MPH), he's slow himself (26.4 ft/sec sprint), and he doesn't hit the ball all that hard (88.1 MPH EV with a 4.4% Barrel% at Triple-A). He had a 90.6 MPH EV with a 9.1% Barrel% in the majors, but the AAA numbers were the bigger sample. The hit tool and approach are the calling card (10.4/16.6 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 18.6% K% and .305 BA in the majors), but as you guys already know well, this isn't my type of player. He's a fine 2B, so it's not like his glove is really going to force the issue either. He's a bench infielder long term, and even if he does get a full time job, the upside isn't worth it. 2025 Projection: 35/6/35/.275/.323/.407/3

11) Aaron Parker - TOR, C, 22.3 - Searching for pro debut breakouts coming out of the draft has been one of my favorite things to do since I started writing back in 2015/16. Back then, nobody else was really doing it, and now I'm happy to see the prospect hounds out there giving great pro debuts the respect they deserve. Harrison Bader and Willie Calhoun were two of my favorite players from this bucket way back in the day, and both still hold a warm place in my heart to this day. Alex Freeland, Luke Adams and Nacho Alverez were 3 guys I named targets in this bucket in their draft year. And just this past season, CJ Kayfus, Tre Morgan, and Jonathan Long were three guys who cracked my off-season rankings on the back of their excellent pro debuts. Now moving onto this season, Aaron Parker, who was selected 187th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, is someone that is demanding recognition for his pro debut. The dude absolutely smashed the ball with a 93.9 MPH EV, and it resulted in 5 homers and a 154 wRC+ in 24 games. The 27% K% is too high, but he's shown a good feel to hit throughout his amateur career, and it comes with a 17% BB%. He was a 6th round pick known for a good bat and decent catcher defense. Catcher definitely isn't my favorite position to stash for fantasy, but Morgan and Kayfus were 1B without huge power, which also isn't my favorite thing to stash, but look how that turned out. He's my favorite pro debut breakout in this year's class, and is a definite target later in first year player drafts. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 64/18/69/.246/.319/.427/1

12) Landen Maroudis - TOR, RHP, 20.3 - Maroudis was looking really good in his 10.2 IP pro debut at Single-A before going down with an elbow injury that required an internal brace surgery in May. The puts his likely return date at some point mid-season, which could be enough time to get the hype rolling again. He had a 0.84 ERA with a 31.6/10.5 K%/BB%. The fastball sat 93.6 MPH, the curve and change got whiffs, and the slider induced weak contact. He also throws a sinker. He's not the type I love taking the "Tommy John" discount on, but I think he's worth a shot this late in the rankings as he was on a clear upward trajectory before going down with the injury. If he returns to full health, I don't see why he can't pick up from where he left off. Major elbow surgery is just part of the pitching prospect journey. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 10/3.98/1.27/160 in 155 IP

13) Alan Roden - TOR, OF, 25.3 - Roden projects as a solid across the board corner outfielder, but he's already 25 years old, and with how high the offensive bar is for a corner outfielder, I'm not sure Roden's bat is quite good enough to clear that bar. Having said that, the guy has done nothing but rake in the minors, and he had another great year in 2024, slashing .293/.391/.475 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 14.2/12.1 K%/BB% in 125 games in the upper minors. He doesn't hit the ball particularly hard (87.6 MPH EV), he's not a burner, and he doesn't lift it a ton (7.4 degree launch). He's also going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.251/.312/.392/2 Prime Projection: 66/14/62/.269/.328/.414/10

14) Damiano Palmegiani - TOR, 3B/1B, 25.2 - Maybe Palmegiani doesn't deserve to crack this list with a 82 wRC+ in 123 games at Triple-A as a 24 year old, but the power upside is in here if he works his way into a shot, which would make him fantasy relevant. He hit 19 homers with an 89.3 MPH EV, 19.4 degree launch, and a 53.6% Pull%. The .210 BA and 28.1% K% is why the wRC+ was so low, and that probably does limit is reasonable upside projection to a bench bat. He's a righty that didn't hit righties that well either (.648 OPS), so it's also a short side of a platoon bench bat. First Base seems especially weak to me up and down the rankings, so he also cracks this list purely on scarcity. - 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.218/.292/.400/0 Prime Projection: 36/12/42/.231/.316/.436/2

Dynasty Baseball Thought/Strategy of the Day (which may or may not be related to the team I’m covering that day)

Another fun trade went down today that shook up the dynasty world. Milwaukee sent Devin Williams to the Yankees for Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin. Hello Luke Weaver, goodbye Luke Weaver. Owning closers in the off-season is a game of Russian Roulette ... except without the gun, or the threat of death, or really any of the stakes ... so I guess not like Russian Roulette at all. But you get my point. Weaver is now almost certainly out of a job, but when one door closes, another door opens. Hello, Trevor Megill, who now looks in the pole position for Milwaukee's closer job, and he has a chance to be in the upper echelon of closers with a 98.8 MPH fastball and a curve that put up a 55% whiff% in 2024. I don't love paying top price for the most hyped closers, so a guy like Megill could end up falling into my range depending on how high his price goes. He wasn't as good in August and September after returning from a back strain, so I guess there is some risk that he doesn't nail down the job, but I think he's the guy. As for Durbin, I knew that the Yanks had no interest in him as anything other than a utility infielder (or trade bait). Unfortunately, he's just a utility infielder on Milwaukee too, although their 3B job is currently open, so maybe he can get a real shot there. His value gets a small bump. Cortes is now locked into a rotation spot, and it clears up some of the logjam in NY for Schmidt to take hold of a job, but the Yanks still have 6 starters, so who knows. Maybe one goes to Houston for Kyle Tucker?
