3/11/25 Dynasty Baseball Rundown
New 3 days ago
*Updated Dynasty Rankings coming this week
Bo Bichette - TOR, SS, 27.1 - Bichette is doing everything he can this spring to prove the big bounce back season is coming. He hit an absolute daddy homer, and even he had to stop and stare at his work. He cracked it at 109.5 MPH and he now has 2 homers with a 150 wRC+ in 30 games. I was betting on a bounce back coming, but wasn't going all in on it. Maybe I should have went all in on it. He looks like a man on a mission.

Christian Yelich - MIL, OF, 33.4 - Yelich back check ... 2 for 3 with a dinger and now has 2 homers with a 161 wRC+ in 11 PA ... not bad, but I will say he definitely looked slightly on the stiff side on that homer, and he still has a 36.4/0.0 K%/BB%. It's good to see he will definitely still be productive, but I don't really think we are fully out of the woods here. I think prime Yelich is likely not walking through that door if I had to guess.

Keibert Ruiz - WAS, C, 26.8 - The power breakout might legitimately be here with Ruiz jacking out his 3rd spring homer in 26 PA. And it's not like he's always been a spring training slugger. He usually hits 0 homers in spring. He didn't exactly crush this one at 101.2 MPH, but he only needs a tick or two of more power to start getting all of those flyballs over the fence. I'm liking Ruiz more and more for 2025.

Drake Baldwin - ATL, C, 24.1 - 1 for 1 with a double and 2 walks. Baldwin now has a 175 wRC+ with a 4.0/24.0 K%/BB% in 25 PA. Murphy is only expected to be out until the middle of April (let's be honest, probably May), but that is enough time for Baldwin to establish that he deserves at least a chunk of this catcher job. Murphy isn't going anywhere, so it's still a problem for fantasy, and if Baldwin does hit well in the first month of the season, it's going to be a problem for Murphy too. This could easily be a timeshare to keep both healthy for deep playoff runs. Maybe one or both can carve out a big enough role to be a legit starting fantasy catcher, but I'm smelling fantasy hell here for both of them over the next few seasons. It's why I can't rank Baldwin higher than like a Top 100-ish prospect.

Joe Boyle - TBR, RHP, 25.8 - The walks are back, and really, they never left. Boyle went 3 IP with 2 hits, 2 ER, and a 4/2 K/BB vs. a nearly real Braves lineup. It was clearly wishful thinking that the Rays would fix him in like 2 seconds. It makes far more sense to start him in the bullpen and see if he can get the walks down in short outings before they even think about putting him in the rotation. Boyle in the rotation is more of a longer term type dream. First, he has to dominate in the bullpen.

Hye-seong Kim - LAD, 2B, 26.2 - 1 for 1 with a 103.4 MPH single. Kim has quietly been getting himself out of that disaster start to spring, and he's officially out of that horrific danger zone with a not horrific .656 OPS. Still not exactly blowing the doors off, but it's just nice to see the extreme struggles behind him.

Carson Williams - TBR, SS, 21.2 - 2 for 4 with a double and now has a 126 wRC+ with a 16.7% K% in 24 PA ... what strikeout problems? It's only spring, but better than like a 40% K% right now. Williams' bat might be ready quicker than we think.

Addison Barger - TOR, 3B/OF, 25.5 - I know Rodon is everyone's guy, and that clearly looks like a good call, but at least show Barger some love too. You don't even need Statcast to see how utterly special this guy's bat can be. Just watch this absolute nuke Barger hit yesterday. His bat speed is double plus and his power is legit. That thing was rocketed at 113.7 MPH and he now has a 192 wRC+ in 23 PA. The glove is an issue, but I'm going to keep on betting on a bat this special.

Triston McKenzie - CLE, RHP, 27.9 - 3.2 IP, 7 hits, 2 ER, 0 HR, 3/0 K/BB vs. a Quad-A Cubs lineup. The velocity is still up with a 93.6 MPH fastball, and the whiffs are still coming with a 38% whiff%. He didn't pitch all that well, and the competition wasn't all that great, but McKenzie continues to be an arrow up player this spring. I still don't fully trust him, but he's clearly going to bounce back from a disaster last couple of years.

Hayden Birdsong - SFG, RHP, 23.7 - 3 IP, 0 hits, 0 ER, 4/0 K/BB. Birdsong has done everything he could to prove he deserves a rotation spot with a 1.29 ERA and 38.5/0.0 K%/BB% in 7 IP. Not one single walk. The fastball sat 96 MPH in this one and notched a 38% whiff%, while the curve notched a 50% whiff%. I don't know if he's going to crack the rotation, but he clearly deserves to. You already know he's one of my favorite targets.

Braxton Ashcraft - PIT, RHP, 25.6 - 2 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 2/0 K/BB. The fastball sat 96 MPH and he used a 5 pitch, putting up a decent 23% whiff% overall. I'm just pumped to see Ashcraft fully healthy with how he ended 2024, and he's definitely moving back up my rankings. He doesn't seem to have a rotation spot right now, and he's probably more of a mid-rotation starter than a true top of the rotation guy, but he's definitely underrated.

Griffin Canning - NYM, RHP, 28.10 - 3.2 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 5/0 K/BB vs. a 50/50 Cardinals lineup. The fastball only sat 92.6 MPH, but it was a whiff machine with a 44% whiff%. The changeup was dominant too with a 38% whiff% and 77.8 EV against. It led to a 35% whiff% overall. Canning was one of my favorite pitching targets in 2024, but he literally showed none of the things I liked about him. He's showing off those things this spring, and maybe this is a case where you are just a year late on the breakout, but I'm still struggling to truly buy in. He's still just a flier for me, but with the banged up Mets rotation, he's not the worst flier.

Kyle Teel - CHW, C, 23.2 - 3 for 5 with a double and a homer and now has a 234 wRC+ in 15 PA. I already assumed Teel was the new catcher of the future for Chicago after the trade, and while it's only spring, his beastly spring performance kinda nails that home for me. Chicago has such a dearth of talent, that maybe Quero gets enough run anyway, but this trade really hurt Quero the most.

Samuel Basallo - BAL, C/1B, 20.7 - Basallo is all dressed up with nowhere to go. He obliterated a 111.3 MPH bomb yesterday for his 2nd homer in 19 PA. He now has a 141 wRC+, but none of it seems to matter, as he has absolutely no where to play this year. He's only 20, so I don't think Baltimore feels any pressure at all, but he might look mighty ready by the 2nd half of this season. It will be interesting to see if he ends up passing Mayo on the depth chart when the time comes ...

Coby Mayo - BAL, 3B, 23.3 - Speaking of Mayo ... 0 for 2 with 2 K's and now has a negative 37 wRC+ with a 33.3% K% ... oh boy

Chandler Simpson - TBR, OF, 24.5 - 0 for 4 and now has a .572 OPS with a 4.8% K% and .286 BA. These super duper light power hitters are really a relic of the past. They don't really exist in the modern game and they don't hold down starting jobs for that long. Simpson is super fun, and I hope he can buck the trend, but I'm just worried the hitting will be way too light to really be a full time starter. Not saying he can't be, but it's why I'm hedging my bets with him as more of a Top 500 dynasty asset.

Shinnosuke Ogasawara - WSH, LHP, 27.6 - 3.2 IP, 7 hits, 3 ER, 2/3 K/BB vs. a bad Marlins lineup. He now has a 7.56 ERA with a 13.0/10.9 K%/BB% in 8.1 IP ... me thinks this is a long reliever, and that is being generous

Jac Caglianone - KCR, 1B, 22.2  - 0 for 1 with a K ... so he's human after all ...
