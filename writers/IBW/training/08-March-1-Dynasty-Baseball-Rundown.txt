3/1/25 Dynasty Baseball Rundown

New
March 1

Jackson Holliday - BAL, 2B, 21.4 - Holliday took that monkey off his back and flung it 378 feet over the right field wall. He tacked on another single for a 2 for 3 day. He's now officially dominating Spring with a 174 wRC+! We never doubted you! ;) ... this is only spring, and while the Bottom of the Rundown guys are mostly tongue in cheek, it's a good reminder to not overreact when the actual season starts. Because it's even easier to overreact to a good or bad couple weeks, or even couple months during the regular season. It's fun to overreact, but you also gotta keep your head when making actual decisions for your squad.

Jordan Walker - STL, OF, 22.10 - 0 for 3 with 3 K's and now has a 63.6% K% with a 11 wRC+ in 11 PA ... Panic! ;)

Joe Boyle - TBR, RHP, 25.8 - 2 IP, 1 hit, 0 ER, 4/0 K/BB vs Pit. So stupid. The Rays fixed him in one outing hah ... The fastball sat 100.3 MPH!!! He also mixed in a cutter, changeup and slider. He put up a 53% whiff% overall. I mean, if he literally turns into an ace on the Rays, how dumb is that. This outing could be good enough for me to take some more fliers on him. In the Rays we trust.

Kris Bubic - KCR, LHP, 27.7 - Don't you just hate when your favorite targets play too well in the spring. Bubic is pitching too damn well, going 2 IP with 2 hits, 0 ER, and a 4/0 K/BB vs. an almost real Arizona lineup. The fastball velocity is hanging in there at 93.3 MPH, and it keeps on dominating legit competition with a 56% whiff% and 77.3 MPH EV against. The changeup and cutter missed some bats too, and he threw a 5 pitch mix. You already know he is one of my favorite targets, but like Clay Holmes, if he keeps pitching this well, the value will just continue to evaporate. That is just how it goes.

Braxton Ashcraft - PIT, RHP, 25.6 - 1.2 IP, 4 hits, 2 ER, 2/0 K/BB vs. Tampa. Ashcraft ended 2024 injured with his stuff down, so it was huge to see this performance where his fastball was back up to 96.4 MPH. The slider, change, and curve all missed bats too, leading to a 32% whiff% overall. I was all in on Ashcraft at points in 2024, but was slightly scared off by the injuries. And he's still a big injury risk, but this outing was a big first step. He's back on the rise for me.

Jesus Luzardo - PHI, LHP, 27.6 - One of my favorite targets did exactly what you would want to see in his first spring outing, going 2 perfect innings with 2 K's. He looked completely healthy, throwing gas with the fastball back up to 96.6 MPH. The changeup was lights out too, going 4 for 4 on whiffs, leading a 50% whiff% overall. There is a reason why I put in a long shot bet on him leading the league in strikeouts. This first outing only emboldened my bounce back take on Luzardo.

Shay Whitcomb - HOU, 3B, 26.6 - Whitcomb keeps on proving his hit tool gains were real, as he's rocking a 12.5%/12.5% K%/BB% in 8 PA this spring, and the power is damn real too as he homered to left center for his first of the spring. He now has a 246 wRC+. If only he had a spot in the lineup, I would love him. Keep an eye out during the year when injuries hit, because he could be a difference making mid season pick up.

Zebby Matthews - MIN, RHP, 24.10 - 3 IP, 2 hits, 0 ER, 5/0 K/BB vs a mostly B Team Orioles lineup. The fastball sat 95.8 MPH and the slider was a whiff machine with 5 of 6 whiffs, leading to a 35% whiff% overall. It's only spring and it's not against A level competition, but he's competing for a rotation spot, so a big spring is important for him. There is no guarantee he wins a spot even if he continues to dominate, but it's all he can do to keep the pressure on. Seeing the elite control while also getting whiffs is encouraging regardless as well.

Dylan Beavers - BAL, OF, 23.7 - The underrated Dylan Beavers isn't going to be underrated for long, and he started that hype ascent yesterday, cracking a 102.2 MPH dinger with a 32 degree launch. He now has a 330 wRC+ in 7 PA. He's not facing the best competition, but this dude is a launch king, and he's big, and he's a great athlete. The biggest issue is that he played RF in this one, and it seems he's likely a corner outfielder. I wish he was better in CF, because then I would feel comfortable calling him their future CF, but I'm leaning Bradfield's way for that. If Bradfield's bat goes all Victor Scott when he eventually gets his shot though, maybe Baltimore does decide to take the defense hit for better offense. Path to playing time isn't easy for Beavers, but he can truly be a fantasy beast.

Carson DeMartini - PHI, 3B/SS, 22.3 - The good pro debut is striking again, as DeMartini is keeping it up in spring, ripping his first dinger 396 feet at 106.8 MPH. He looked so locked in at the dish there. Never doubt a good pro debut. DeMartini's rise feels inevitable.

Sandy Alcantara - MIA, RHP, 29.7 - 2 IP, 2 hits, 0 ER, 3/0 K/BB vs a very bad Braves lineup. It's only been two short spring outs, but it sure looks like Alcantara is completely healthy with a 99.1 MPH fastball and good control. I was hesitant to buy the Tommy John discount here because he was never a big strikeout guy and I was always a hair lower on Alcantara for fantasy, but he definitely seems to be back. I guess he still has to prove he can do it for longer outings and stay healthy, but his value is definitely on the rise for me.

Gage Workman - CHC, SS/3B, 25.5 - Another big day for Workman as he demolished a 110.8 MPH bomb off Jack Leiter for his 2nd of the spring. You can see how quickly that thing left the bat. This dude has no joke tools, and the 26.3% K% is staying in a reasonable range right now in 19 PA. He's just a back up plan for Chicago, but we know back up plans have a way of getting into the lineup during a long season, and if Workman does, he has the skillset to make a major fantasy impact.

Caleb Durbin - MIL, 2B/3B, 25.1 - The little man is on the board with that classic little man lift and pull homer for his first of the spring. He only has a 48 wRC+ with a 23.5% K% in 17 PA, so that isn't exactly going to lock down that open starting job, but this dinger is a start. This is a competition that is almost surely going to go into the regular season. I like Durbin. He's not necessarily one of my targets, but I see the fantasy appeal for sure.

Curtis Mead - TBR, 2B/3B, 24.5 - 2 for 3 with a 100.1 MPH single and is now 10 for 12 on the spring. 10 for 12 would be an impressive free throw shooting percentage, let alone a batting average off professional pitchers. I've never seen someone so locked in.

Shohei Ohtani - LAD, RHP/DH, 30.9 - Ohtani shoulder check in his spring debut ... 1 for 3 with a 107 MPH homer of Kikuchi ... he's still good, shockingly

Jo Adell - LAA, OF, 26.0 - 1 for 3 with a 109.2 MPH bomb off Dustin May ... hell yea, let's find that groove Adell ...

Hye-seong Kim - LAD, 2B, 26.2 - 0 for 2 with 2 K's ... he hasn't found bottom yet ...

Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.3 - 0 for 4 with 4 K's and is now 0 for 11 with 7 K's ... don't you dare do this to us Campbell ...
