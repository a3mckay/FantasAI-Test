Top 260 Outfielders: 2025 Deep Dynasty Baseball Positional Rankings

New
January 25

1) Juan Soto - NYM, OF, 26.5 - Soto didn't give the Yanks even the slightest bit of deference, going to the highest bidder in the New York Mets, signing for 15 years and $765 million (the Yanks reportedly offered 16 years for $760 million). He's just a subway ride away from his new digs ... or more accurately, just a chauffeured ride away ... or probably even more accurately, just a helicopter ride away. For a super elite hitter like Soto, ballpark doesn't really matter, but the most interesting part of this move is how much he changed his hitting profile for Yankee Stadium's short porch.  He put up a career high by far 45.1% Pull% (38.9% in 2023), and it led to a career high 41 homers. The Yanks were the 3rd best park for lefty homers last year, while the Mets were 10th worst. Will Soto continue to pull the ball that much? Or will he decide to go back to his career norms? My guess is that he keeps on pulling it, because he actually hit one more homer on the road than he did at home. It seems Yankee Stadium gave him the push to unlock more homer power regardless of ballpark, and I don't see why he would want to go back. His 19.7% Barrel%, 94.2 MPH EV, and 57% Hard Hit% were all career highs. His Statcast expected homer totals were 46 for Yankee Stadium and the exact same 46 for Citi Field, again underscoring that he is ballpark proof. The only thing he doesn't do is steal bases with only 7 steals, and that is what keeps him just a smidge behind Witt, Elly and Gunnar. 2025 Projection: 118/35/105/.289/.418/.539/9

2) Corbin Carroll - ARI, OF, 24.7 - Back when Carroll was in the throes of his awful start, I made a decree by Fantasy Law to not sell low in one of my Dynasty Baseball Rundowns, writing, "'The captain goes down with the ship.' That’s just Maritime Law. Now, I’m no sailor, but as the world’s foremost expert on Fantasy Law, there are some players that you are required to go down with the ship for, and Corbin Carroll is most certainly one of those players. I’ve seen a ton of panic and sell low offers for Carroll, but all of the warning signs could be flashing red, the sirens could be blaring, and you are still legally obligated to not sell low on an established elite dynasty asset like Carroll." He continued to struggle for a bit after writing that, but before long, he did indeed turn that ship around, slashing .258/.351/.577 with 20 homers, 20 steals, and a 10.6/11.3 K%/BB% in his final 71 games. He smashed the ball with a 91.3 MPH EV and 14.6 degree launch over that time. I would say any lingering concern over his shoulder injury can be put to rest, cementing Carroll as a truly elite dynasty asset with standout contact, approach, power, and speed. He's the total package. Don't be scared off by the poor first half. - 2025 Projection: 119/28/84/.270/.357/.519/42

3) Kyle Tucker - CHC, OF, 28.2 - A fractured shin knocked Tucker out for half the season, but he put up a 1.041 OPS in 18 games after returning, so there is zero concern about the injury long term. I guess the one area of his game where maybe you can get a little nervous about is stolen bases. He only stole one bag in those 18 games, and he put up a career low 26.0 ft/sec sprint, which is in the bottom 18% of the league. He's never been fast but he's always been an excellent base stealer, so I'm not sure I'm extra worried about it, but he does kinda feel like the type of player who may not steal as much as he gets into his 30's. He's not there yet at only 28, but it might be something to keep in mind. Steals aside, he does feel like the type of player who will rake deep into his 30's. He only played in 78 games, but it was the best year of his career with a 180 wRC+ that came on the back of a career high by far 16.5% BB% (11.9% in 2023). He also hit 23 homers with 11 steals, and if you double that over a full season pace, that is 46 homers with 22 steals if my math is correct ... carry the 1. He's been one of the most consistently great players of his generation. Almost too consistent as he semes to get taken for granted. - 2025 Projection: 102/34/109/.285/.378/.533/24

4) Aaron Judge - NYY, OF, 32.11 - In pure win now mode, I can see ranking Judge 2nd overall, but with him turning 33 years old just one month into the 2025 season, age starts to move a little more to the forefront of my mind. 33 years old is generally the number for me when I maybe start to explore sell opportunities if I want to rebuild or retool, so while I'm not saying to sell Judge, it's the reason why he isn't ranked even higher coming off his massive season. His 218 wRC+ was the best in baseball by a massive margin. The only players to put up a higher wRC+ in a season are Barry Bonds (3x), Babe Ruth (3x), Ted Williams (2x), and Roger Hornsby (1x). I mean, do I need to say more? No. No I don't. - 2025 Projection: 112/50/128/.293/.422/.661/10

5) Fernando Tatis Jr. - SDP, OF, 26.3 - Tatis proved without a shadow of a doubt that he is not going to fade into mediocrity after his relatively down 2023 season coming off the PED suspension and multiple surgeries (not that I had much doubt, ranking him 6th overall last off-season). He demolished the ball with a 93.5 MPH EV, 14.5% Barrel%, .393 xwOBA, and a 55.1% Hard Hit% which was in the top 1% of baseball. Not only were his power metrics in prime form, but his 21.9% K% was a career best. He missed over two months with a stress reaction in his leg, which I guess you can add to his "injury risk" pile, but he was fine when he returned in September, and he went nuclear in the playoffs too with 4 homers in 7 games. It all resulted in 25 homers with a .280 BA in 109 games (including the playoffs). That is about a 35 homer pace over a full season. The one area where the injuries did seem to take their toll was on the bases. He only stole 11 bases on 14 attempts and his sprint speed tanked to 28.4 ft/sec (29.3 in 2023). Maybe you can blame the leg injury, but he wasn't running much before that injury, and I'm not sure how you can blame the wrist/shoulder injuries for him getting slower, especially since he was fine in 2023. How much he's going to run in the future is the wild card in this profile, and that question, along with some continued injury risk, is enough to nudge him just outside of the of that Top 5-ish area into the Top 10 area. - 2025 Projection: 96/33/89/.283/.348/.529/18

6) Ronald Acuna Jr. - ATL, OF, 27.3 - Acuna tore his right ACL in 2021 and now he's torn his left ACL in 2024. Since that first torn ACL, he's been in the process of slowing down with a 29.4 ft/sec sprint in 2021, a 28.5 ft/sec sprint in 2022, a 28.0 ft/sec sprint in 2023 and finally a 27.7 ft/sec sprint in 2024. And now coming off this 2nd ACL tear, I don't think there is any question at all that Acuna is not going to be the athlete he was in his prime. Even with the lowest sprint speed of his career, he still stole 16 bases in 49 games, which is about a 48 steal pace, so I don't think he is all of a sudden going to stop running, but let's see how he looks coming off this 2nd major knee injury. He was also in the midst of the worst season of his career before going down with the injury. He hit only 4 homers with a .716 OPS. He was definitely getting unlucky as he was crushing the ball with a 92.2 MPH EV, but even his .348 xwOBA was a career low by far. He wasn't able to maintain any of the contact gains from 2023 with his K% jumping back up to 23.9% (11.4% in 2023). After the first ACL tear, Acuna's first year back wasn't particularly great with 15 homers and a 115 wRC+ in 119 games in 2022, so keep that in mind for 2025. He had a historic season in 2023 of course, so the hope is that he can do the same eventually after this one, but this one will be his 2nd, and it's hard for me to completely ignore it. He's also expected to miss about a third of the season in 2025. Acuna is the type of talent you want to keep betting on no matter what the circumstances are, but I'm definitely a little concerned. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/63/.272/.363/.524/20

7) Julio Rodriguez - SEA, OF, 24.3 - The Slow Start King is going to give his dynasty owners a massive coronary event if he gets off to yet another slow start in 2025. He seriously needs to figure something out this off-season. Treat Spring Training like it's the regular season? Ramp up earlier? I don't know the answer because I don't know what his off-season routine is, but he needs to do something differently. He put up a .616 OPS in his first 87 games before exploding after that, slashing .318/.371/.543 with 13 homers, 7 steals, and a 23.3/6.5 K%/BB% in his final 56 games. He's far too talented to be too scared off by the slow starts. His 76.3 MPH swing is the 9th fastest in baseball. He crushes the ball with a 91.7 MPH EV and he has elite speed with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint. The one area of his game which is preventing him from joining the true elites, especially as a real life hitter, are his plate skills. It's yet to improve at all in his 3 years in the majors with a 30.9% whiff% and 37.4% Chase% (25.4/6.2 K%/BB%). He can thrive in fantasy especially even without that improving at all, but if that can take a step forward, we may not have seen the best of Julio yet. - 2025 Projection: 100/31/100/.281/.342/.490/32

8) James Wood - WAS, OF, 22.7 - I don't need to do any deep victory lap philosophizing when it comes to if James Wood is a hit for me (see the Washington Nationals Dynasty Team Report for more thoughts on victory lapping in dynasty), because I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I can victory lap the hell out of James Wood. I named him a major First Year Player Draft Target in his draft year, and then I ranked him all the way up at 68th overall in the 2024 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings. I couldn't help but buy into that beastly power/speed combo from a 6'7'' frame, and the swing was always short enough to bet on the hit tool ending up good enough. And that is exactly how it played out in his rookie year with an elite 92.8/96.9 MPH AVG/FB EV, a plus 28.7 ft/sec sprint, a well above average 21% Chase%, and a not in the true danger zone 29.6% whiff%. It resulted in 9 homers, 14 steals, a .264 BA and a 120 wRC+ in 79 games. The 2.4 degree launch subdued the homer power a bit, but he hits the ball so hard that he's launch proof, and that number is certainly coming up in the future. He's basically Elly De La Cruz with better plate skills and half as many steals. Do not even think about valuing Wood as anything but a near elite dynasty asset this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 89/24/87/.251/.346/.474/26 Prime Projection: 105/32/105/.268/.364/.518/28

9) Jackson Chourio - MIL, OF, 21.1 - I spent most of my waking hours last off-season agonizing over who to place as the #1 prospect in baseball between Chourio, Holliday and Langford. And honestly, it wasn't only waking hours, I was dreaming of a Chourio 20/20 rookie season in my sleep. I trusted the voices I was getting from the baseball gods, placing Chourio first overall on my prospect rankings, and projecting his 2024 stat line for 21 homers, 22 steals, 75 RBI, a .320 OBP and a .469 SLG in my 2024 Top 1,000 Rankings. And as we know, he ended up outdoing Langford by a solid amount and Holliday by a city mile, hitting 21 homers with 25 steals, 79 RBI, a .327 OBP and a .464 SLG. Damn, it's almost like I really did see his future stat line in my dreams (and yes, I'm not mentioning batting average or runs because I didn't nail those ha). He hit the ball very hard with a 89.7 MPH EV, he had elite speed with a 29.7 ft/sec sprint, and he had a slightly above average 21.1% K%. And all of those numbers include his rough first 2 months of the season. If you just look at his last 4 months, which is reasonable considering he was a 20 year old rookie just finding his MLB sea legs, his numbers get even more impressive, slashing .305/.360/.527 with 16 homers, 15 steals, and a 18.4/7.3 K%/BB% in his final 97 games. There is some room for improvement with his plate approach (below average 31.9% Chase%) and launch (7.6 degrees), but neither of those are too bad to begin with, and he has the profile to make that work even if he can't improve it. But he'll barely be 21 years old next season, so I don't see why we wouldn't expect all areas of his game to improve. Wood vs. Chourio is a coin flip for me, but I gave the edge to Wood because he hits the ball harder and chases less. - 2025 Projection: 93/26/89/.285/.339/.488/28

10) Wyatt Langford - TEX, OF, 23.5 - Langford's surface stats don't jump off the page with a .253 BA, .740 OPS, 16 homers, and 19 steals in 134 games, but his underlying skills were jumping off the page all season, and it finally showed in September. He went bonkos to close out the season, slashing .289/.372/.579 with 9 homers, 7 steals, and a 19.0/10.2 K%/BB% in his final 32 games. Even if you pull it back to June 3rd, he had a .804 OPS with 15 homers and 18 steals in his final 98 games. And like I mentioned, the underlying skills are super impressive. He hits the ball very hard with a 9.3% Barrel% and 89.6 MPH EV (91.3 MPH EV in those final 32 games). He lifts it with a 16.6 degree launch, he has elite speed with a 29.8 ft/sec sprint, he has above average contact rates (22.9% whiff% and 20.6% K%), and he has an above average plate approach (23% Chase% with a 9.2% BB%). The cherry on top is that his 74.5 MPH swing is nearly elite, and it's a short swing too with 7 foot length. That swing speed/length combo is special. Only Heliot Ramos swings a faster bat with a shorter swing. He's going to explode in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 89/26/93/.274/.352/.481/24

11) Jackson Merrill - SDP, OF, 21.11 - Merrill's ability to raise his launch angle considerably, while not losing even a smidge of contact prowess, is nothing short of incredible. He went from putting up a 59.9% GB% with a 19.2% K% at Single-A in 2022 to putting up a 35.9% GB% with a 17% K% in the majors in 2024. Justin Crawford better be blowing up his celly round the clock to get some pointers on how he did it. It resulted in Merrill having one of, if the not the best rookie season in baseball, slashing .292/.326/.500 with 24 homers, 16 steals, and a 17.0/4.9 K%/BB% in 156 games. The underlying numbers back it all up with a 11.3% Barrel%, 90.4 MPH EV, and a .376 xwOBA. The only area of his game to quibble with is that he's never walked a ton, and he chased a lot with a 34.4% Chase%. He's also never been a huge base stealer in his career, but I don't think him stealing 20+ bags is out of the question at all. He's an easy elite dynasty asset, and he's in a tier with James Wood, Jackson Chourio, Paul Skenes, and Wyatt Langford as the top rookies in the game. - 2025 Projection: 86/25/92/.288/.336/.492/19

12) Yordan Alvarez - HOU, OF, 27.9 - Yordan had to go ahead and put his surgically repaired knees back in our mind right at the end of 2024, tweaking his knee after sliding into 2nd base on September 22nd, which ended his regular season. He returned for the playoffs, so it's not a big deal, but any knee injury is going to have our minds racing, thinking about if they are going to become a concern as he starts to age. The good news is that he's only 27 years old, so I wouldn't worry about it quite yet. He's as consistent as they come with beastly season after beastly season. He slashed .308/.392/.567 with 35 homers, a career high 6 steals, and a 15.0/10.9 K%/BB% in 147 games. There are zero concerns about him over the short term, but I do think the knees are something to at least keep in the back of your mind down the line. - 2025 Projection: 91/35/100/.303/.405/.579/3

13) Mookie Betts - LAD, 2B/OF, 32.6 - Betts is the leader of the Slow Bat Speed Kings with a 69 MPH swing that is 442nd "best" in baseball (minimum 50 swings). But he proves swinging an electric bat isn't the only path to success. He had another great season which was only interrupted by a fractured hand in mid June, slashing .289/.372/.491 with 19 homers, 16 steals, and a 11.0/11.8 K%/BB% in 116 games. He has 4 dingers in 11 post season games and counting. The 11% K% tied a career best, and his 16 steals tied for a 6 year best. The 26.7 ft/sec sprint was a career low and in the bottom 30% of the league, so while there certainly seems to be some physical decline, it hasn't impacted his stats quite yet. Like I've been saying with elite players like this, 33 years old is when I start to think about selling, so I'm running it back in 2025 with Mookie. 2025 Projection: 110/32/100/.290/.370/.525/18

14) Jarren Duran - BOS, OF, 28.7 - Duran's hit tool and plate approach have improved every year of his 4 year career, and considering how electric of a player he is, that is all he need to go nuclear. He slashed .285/.342/.492 with 21 homers, 34 steals and a 21.8/7.3 K%/BB% in 160 games. He has elite speed with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint, he hits the ball very hard with a 90.8 MPH EV, and he has plus bat speed with a 73.6 MPH swing. There is absolutely nothing in the underlying numbers to say this year was a fluke, and with how he's improved every year of his career (48 wRC+ in 2021, 77 wRC+ in 2022, 120 wRC+ in 2023, 129 wRC+ in 2024), who is to say he can't do it again in 2025. I'm all in. 2025 Projection: 101/23/83/.280/.341/.476/33

15) Oneil Cruz - PIT, OF/SS, 26.6 - Saying that Cruz' 95.5 MPH EV is elite would be an understatement. It is in all time great territory, trailing only Judge and Ohtani, two all time greats. His 78.6 MPH swing speed is also super elite, trailing only Giancarlo Stanton's 81.2 MPH swing (Stanton laps the field, with nobody even close to him). And he also has double plus speed with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint speed. This is an extremely special talent. Yes, there is hit tool risk with a 34.1% whiff% and 30.1% K%, but I really don't think it's as risky at it seems. He hit .259 this year with a .266 xBA, and in 1,009 career PA he has a .250 BA. He can clearly thrive with the elevated swing and miss. He put together a strong year in 2024 with 21 homers and 22 steals in 23 attempts in 146 games, but he is merely just scratching the surface of what he's capable of. He was a major target coming into the year, and he turned into an elite dynasty asset. Make sure you treat him like one this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/92/.255/.328/.474/26

16) Jazz Chisholm - NYY, 3B/OF, 27.2 - I ranked Jazz 34th overall on the 2024 Top 1,000, absolutely refusing to fade a player with such a beastly power/speed combo, and named him a major target, writing, "Buy the injury discount. His proven upside is way way way too high to let your fear control you. He was on a 30/30 pace this year. The hit tool isn't great, but he has 1,193 PA with a .245 BA. That is a large enough sample where I'm not too worried about the bottom falling out. If you want to shy away from mediocre talents due to injury concern, that is fine with me. Even shying away from good talents is reasonable. But you don't shy away from near elite talents like Chisholm." And what he just did in 2024 is why you don't fade this kind of talent. He slashed .256/.324/.436 with 24 homers, 40 steals, and a 24.5/8.5 K%/BB% in 147 games. He was playing well with the Marlins, but he exploded when he got the Yanks with 11 homers, 18 steals and a 132 wRC+ in 46 games. It's not even that he hit particularly well at Yankee Stadium, it just seemed to light a fire under him, but for sure it's also a big home field upgrade for him. And the most important thing of all is that he stayed healthy. Health is the main reason why people faded him, and unfortunately, it still has to be taken into account in his price. Staying healthy one season is good, but he needs to go back to back healthy seasons for me to take "injury risk" off his resume, or at least have it downplayed. We saw Robert stay basically healthy in 2023, only to again miss a large chunk of the season in 2024. Jazz could easily follow that same path. If not for injury risk, Jazz has an argument for Top 15 status, so this ranking does factor in a bit of risk. - 2025 Projection: 87/25/84/.252/.323/.455/33

17) Luis Robert - CHW, OF, 27.8 - Robert is in super juicy buy low territory right now. This one feels like it's served up on a silver platter. He had a down year in 2024 with a career worst 33.2% K% and .224 BA, but he has a 1,944 career PA track record with a 27% K% and .267 BA. He's smack dab in the middle of his prime at 27 years old, and he has near elite bat speed with a 74.5 MPH swing. His 28.8 ft/sec sprint speed was a 4 year high, and he hit the ball very hard with a 90.1 MPH EV. There is no physical decline, and there is a huge track record which says this was simply a down year. And even in a down year he hit 14 homers with 23 steals in 100 games (about a 21/35 pace). It's as easy as could be to buy the bounce back in 2025, but the one real area of concern is injuries. He once again missed a large chunk of the season with a hip injury. He's played in over 100 games just once in his career (2023), and even that year his season ended with a sprained MCL which would have kept him out for a couple months had it not been the end of the season. The White Sox are also terrible, which can't help the motivation, let alone Runs and RBI. Those reasons are why he can't really be in elite or near elite asset territory, but there is easy 30/30 upside in here if he does stay healthy, and that is worth trying to acquire on a discount this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 82/23/72/.254/.312/.470/28

18) Riley Greene - DET, OF, 24.6 - With how volatile development can be, it's always nice when a talented prospect has a nice and smooth upward trajectory. Greene put up a 98 wRC+ in 2022, a 121 wRC+ in 2023 and finally a 135 wRC+ in 2024. He raised his launch (12.2 degrees), improved his whiff% (26.8%) and improved his Chase% (23.1%). That is all he needed to explode with how hard he hit the ball already (13.4% Barrel% with a 91.3 MPH EV) and how fast he swung the bat (elite 74.5 MPH swing). He slashed .262/.348/.479 with 24 homers, 4 steals, and a 26.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 137 games. Even if this is where he tops out, that would be a very good player, but I think he has at least one more level in him. I would be surprised if he can't get that strikeout rate down into the low 20's at true peak, resulting in several seasons of plus to double plus hit/power production.. - 2025 Projection: 86/28/92/.276/.359/.498/7

19) Michael Harris - ATL, OF, 24.1 - It's an absolutely no brainer to stay (almost) fully in on Harris. I say almost because his stolen bases and speed dropped off considerably in 2024 with 10 steals and a 28.3 ft/sec sprint in 110 games. He had a 29.4 ft/sec sprint in 2022. Some of it could be blamed on a hamstring injury that knocked him out for 2 months, but not all of it could be blamed on that. It seems like the reasonable hope is for him to get to around 20+ rather than 30+, which is still very valuable. And steals can be extremely hard to predict because it often is just a choice of how much a player wants to run, so I wouldn't rule anything out. His plate approach also hasn't improved at all in his 3 years in the bigs with a 39.6% Chase%, and finally he hasn't improved his launch at all with a 7.5 degree launch. Honestly after writing that all out, even I'm questioning if maybe I shouldn't still be all the way in, but when I look at his elite 74.7 MPH swing, 10% Barrel%, 90.5/95.3 MPH AVG/FB EV, 47% Hard Hit%, and 20% K%, I realize there is no way I'm betting against this guy. That just screams electric player, and keep in mind all of those above stats were accumulated in his age 21-23 year old seasons. I don't think we've seen his prime yet, and just a few incremental improvements in a few area could result in absolutely beastly seasons. His development hasn't gone exactly like planned, which is why I wouldn't consider him in that Top 20 ish dynasty asset area, but he's easily still a Top 50 guy. - 2025 Projection: 88/23/77/.282/.328/.467/23

20) Lawrence Butler - OAK, OF, 24.9 - Butler put all of his faithful followers loyalty to the test when he got sent down to the minors after putting up a .555 OPS in his first 41 games of the season. He pulled the dynasty baseball version of "if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best." I'm not gonna lie, after naming him a target this off-season, I did drop him in one league after he got sent back down, but I never let him leave my mind, and when he got called back up and hit a dinger or two, I spent large amounts of FAAB because I simply couldn't bear to watch him breakout on someone else's team, and that proved prudent as he was a beast the rest of the way. He slashed .291/.330/.565 with 20 homers, a perfect 15 for 15 on the bases, and a 21.8/6.1 K%/BB% in his final 84 games. The reason I was so quick to stick my neck out to pick him back up (and shouldn't have dropped him in the first place) is that the underlying numbers were screaming that he was getting unlucky earlier in the season, and the underlying numbers don't lie (well, sometimes they lie, but not in this case). He smashes the ball with an 11% Barrel% and 91.1 MPH EV, he's an excellent athlete, and his hit tool has continually improved throughout his career, with the improvements sticking in the majors with a respectable 26.8% whiff% and 27.3% chase%. And to top it all off, he's about to get a major ballpark upgrade in 2025 and beyond. He had a .866 OPS on the road vs. a .753 OPS at home this year. I've been super high on him, and I'll continue to be super high on him. Even this ranking might be too low. - 2025 Projection: 84/28/82/.255/.326/.487/20

21) Dylan Crews - WAS, OF, 23.1 - Crews' dynasty value/hype has seen some fluctuations since being drafted, but the thing that was quietly flying under the radar, was how good he was on the bases, and for fantasy, that has a major impact on his value. He stole 25 bases in 100 games in the upper minors, and then he stole 12 bags with a double plus 29.3 ft/sec sprint in his 31 game MLB debut. He only stole 6 bases in 71 games his junior year of college, and then went 3 for 7 in his pro debut, so I can't blame anyone for not expecting it, but it's clearly a real skill he has, and it makes Crews insanely exciting for fantasy again. He combines the speed with above average contact rates (19.7% K%), above average chase rates (26.6%), and plus power (94.7 MPH FB/LD EV in the majors and a 90.2 MPH EV in the minors). The only quibble in his profile is the low launch (8.8 degrees), but he has the skillset to make that work, and he only needs to raise it a bit higher to be in a completely fine range, which I'm betting he will. The Langford vs. Crews debate might not end up as easy as we thought, and with Crews not really being considered in that lofty tier anymore, there could be a buy window here this off-season. If you can buy off the relatively subdued hype and .641 MLB OPS, I would be all over it. He's a Top 50 dynasty asset in my book. - 2025 Projection: 81/21/76/.259/.334/.448/26 Prime Projection: 94/27/97/.278/.359/.481/28

22) Jasson Dominguez - NYY, OF, 22.2 - The Yankees didn't want to unleash Dominguez in the majors this year, and his .617 OPS in the 67 PA he did receive isn't super impressive, but make no mistake, Dominguez is still on the superstar path. His 75.4 MPH swing is straight elite, which proves right there that his talent really wasn't that overhyped as an international prospect. His 23.4% whiff% was comfortably above average, which is pretty huge to see, and his 28.1% Chase% was slightly above average. Tack on plus speed, and Dominguez' beastly potential was even able to shine through despite the Yanks refusing to unleash him. And oh yea, he destroyed the upper minors immediately after returning from Tommy John surgery in mid May with a 135 wRC+, 11 homers, 16 steals (in 17 attempts) and a 20.0/8.8 K%/BB% in 58 games. Is he really 22 years old and not 26 years old? Beats me. But I don't care when it comes to a talent this huge (I gave my thoughts on MLB cracking down on players' lying about their ages in the Philadelphia Phillies Dynasty Team Report). I see no reason why the Yanks won't unleash him immediately in 2025, and he could be on a beeline for elite dynasty asset status in short order. Go after him. - 2025 Projection: 83/21/76/.246/.323/.434/26 Prime Projection: 109/28/91/.266/.351/.487/34

23) Spencer Steer - CIN, 1B/OF, 27.4 - Good luck trying to predict stolen bases. Steer was quite bad at stealing bases in the minors, and barely ran. He went 0 for 1 in his 28 game MLB debut in 2022. And then over the last two year he's become one of the better base stealers in the majors. He went 15 for 18 in 2023 and then 25 for 28 in 2024. His 28.2 ft/sec sprint speed is definitely plenty fast enough to steal bags if you are good at it, and it seems Steer has been putting in the work on that part of his game. It's a big deal for his fantasy value, because he already had a strong plate approach and above average game power. He had a 20.9%/11.0% K%/BB% with an 88 MPH EV, 17.4 degree launch, and a 44.4% Pull%. With the newfound stolen bases, that should make him a perennial .250/20+/20+ guy for the next several years. And if he can find just a hair more raw power in his late 20's, there could be a big career year or two mixed in there. Defense is his biggest problem as he isn't good anywhere on the field, but he has versatility (he can play every position but CF), and he's not terrible at any of them either. I'm not really concerned about his playing time at all. I've been high on Steer since his breakout in the upper minors in 2022, and I'll continue to be high on him. - 2025 Projection: 81/25/90/.253/.339/.456/21

24) Brenton Doyle - COL, OF, 26.11 - Doyle lowered his strikeout rate from 35% in 2023 to 25.4% in 2024, which has to be one of the biggest improvements of strikeout rate in a single year of all time. That is really unbelievable considering his strikeout rates were over 30% his entire minor league career too other than in rookie ball. If this were a case where the K rate was back over 30% in the 2nd half, I would be less likely to believe, but he put up a 26.1% K% post all break in 57 games, and a 20.8% K% in 19 games in September. It's prudent to factor in some regression, but it's pretty clear he took a big step forward with his hit tool, and that is all he needed to let his big power/speed combo shine. He hit 23 homers with 30 steals, and the underlying numbers back it up with a 10.5% Barrel% and 29.3 ft/sec sprint. If he didn't have such a terrible history of hit tool issues, he would likely rank even higher than this, so even this high ranking takes into account some added risk there. I'm 100% buying into Doyle. - 2025 Projection: 86/26/82/.248/.315/.447/29

25) Brent Rooker - OAK, OF/DH, 30.5 - I remember when Rooker was a fun FYPD "sleeper" pick back in 2017/18 after he destroyed pro ball in his pro debut with 18 homers in 62 games in the lower minors that same year he got drafted (just another reminder to not underrate great pro debuts). He then went on to rip dingers every year since, culminating in this monster career year in 2024. I guess what I'm saying is, maybe this monster year shouldn't have been as surprising at it seemed. He crushed 39 homers with a 164 wRC+ in 145 games, and the .383 xwOBA, which was top 4% in baseball, backed up the surface stats. It wasn't only the homers though, he also hit .293 and stole 11 bags. The reason why I called it a "career year," is that for one, it just smells of a career year the same way Matt Olson's 2023 smelled of a career year to me, and for two, the underlying numbers don't back up the hit tool. He had a 28.8% K% with a 34.1% whiff%, which tells me the BA is definitely coming way down in 2025. Regardless, there is zero doubt that Rooker is a legit elite power hitter with a 96.9 MPH FB/LD EV and 18.9 degree launch, so even if the BA comes way down, there is plenty of value to be had, and like every other hitter in Oakland, the ballpark upgrade will only help him. - 2025 Projection: 78/33/93/.260/.334/.510/8

26) Pete Crow-Armstrong - CHC, OF, 23.0 - Pete Crow Armstrong’s power has been underrated from the time he was drafted. He was my #1 target in his 2020/21 FYPD class after getting drafted a ridiculous 19th overall, writing in his FYPD blurb, “Armstrong stands out for his plus speed, plus defense, and strong track record of hitting. Power hasn’t been a big part of his game, but he has recently added muscle onto his projectable 6’1” frame, and a 99 MPH exit velocity mark at a 2019 Perfect Game event is damn good. Armstrong is my favorite target in first year player drafts relative to consensus.” I’ve basically named him a target every 3 months since then, even ranking him within my Top 100 overall this off-season at #99. And in 2024, especially the 2nd half of 2024, we started to see the first buds of a breakout that could absolutely explode in 2025. For starters, he put up a 88.9/94.0 MPH AVG/FB EV on the season, which shows that power potential I saw 4 years ago wasn't a mirage. And when it comes with a 17.2 degree launch, an elite 30.0 ft/sec sprint speed, and elite CF defense, you have the makings of an extremely exciting fantasy player. We saw that player in his final 65 games, slashing .267/.317/.457 with 9 homers, 11 steals, and a 21.8/6.9 K%/BB%. The reason why he isn't ranked even higher is because he still does have some deficiencies in his game. His 70.6 MPH swing is below average, his 41.4% Chase% is extreme, and his 29.9% whiff% is well below average. That isn't exactly my favorite trifecta of skills, but he's still so young, I foresee all of those numbers improving. And focusing on what he doesn't do well is silly when what he does do well is so insanely exciting. Put some respect on this man’s name. His name is Pete Crow Armstrong, not Pete Crow Armweak. - 2025 Projection: 82/18/71/.244/.312/.425/31 Prime Projection: 93/24/74/.259/.331/.446/44

27) Kristian Campbell - BOS, 2B/OF, 22.3 - Campbell possesses one of the most visually disgusting swings I have ever seen, and I mean that in the best way possible. It looks like he literally unhinges his shoulder to turn his body into a cannon, absolutely unfurling on the baseball. Here is what I wrote about a homer Campbell hit in early September in the in-season Dynasty Baseball Rundowns: "on his latest homer, I think he dislocated his shoulder with one of the most bad intentions swings I've seen."  Underscoring my visual evaluation of that explosive shoulder movement is that shortly after that homer he hit the IL with a lat strain, which is right under the shoulder blades. Campbell underwent a well documented swing change and bat speed training to unlock more power last off-season, which was obviously successful beyond anybody's wildest imagination, so let's just hope that it's not going to cause more injuries. That is the only small thing that is even rattling around in my brain as a negative, because the season he just had was nothing short or spectacular. He slashed .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers, 24 steals, and a 19.9/14.3 K%/BB% in 115 games spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He was just as dominant in the upper minors as he was at High-A with across the board domination. He hits it hard, he has a good feel to hit, he has a good approach, he has size (6'3'', 191 pounds), he has bat speed, he can lift it, and he has speed. You can be hesitant to fully buy in because it feels like he came out of nowhere, but he put up a 1.033 OPS in 45 games in the ACC in 2023, a .932 OPS in 58 games in 2022 in the Northwoods League, and then a .911 OPS in 22 games at mostly High-A in his pro debut, so it's not his fault that everyone underrated him. He always had a good feel to hit and good approach, and he always had the frame and athleticism to tack on more power, so I'm not going to hold it against him that he wasn't more hyped (4th round pick in 2023). He still didn't lift and pull the ball a ton with an under 40% Pull% and under 30% FB%, but he knew when to pick his spots (as you saw with that homer video above), and he has the type of profile that can thrive without an extreme lift and pull profile. I'm all in on Campbell. He's an elite prospect who has a chance to break camp in the bigs. 2025 Projection: 68/16/61/.252/.324/.423/19 Prime Projection: 98/26/89/.277/.356/.478/26

28) Roman Anthony - BOS, OF, 20.11 - Because the rule of prospecting is that if you are even the smallest, tiniest, tiny bit lower on a prospect than other prospectors (most to all have Anthony over Campbell, while I have it the other way around), you must bash that prospect with an overly critical lens, let me start with the negatives here. For one, Anthony isn't the best base stealer with a career 38 steals in 52 attempts (he was 21 for 28 last year), so there is risk that he doesn't run as much in the majors as we hope. Secondly, he hits the ball on the ground a lot with an around 50% GB% in 2024, which could limit his homer upside. And lastly, there is some hit tool risk with a 23.5% K%. Now that we got that out of the way, let me just say that I obviously love Anthony, he's a legit 50/50 coin flip with Campbell, and he's a no doubt elite prospect. He started the season as a 19 year old in the upper minors and obliterated both Double-A and Triple-A, slashing .291/.396/.498 with 18 homers, 21 steals, and a 23.5/14.6 K%/BB% in 119 games. He crushes the ball, he has speed, he has size, he has elite age to level production, and he hit both lefties and righties well in 2024. He's as close to a Gunnar Henderson clone as there is, and if you wanted to put him even as the #1 prospect in baseball, I wouldn't argue with you. He's going to be a beast. 2025 Projection: 51/14/46/.251/.328/.422/9 Prime Projection: 92/31/98/.272/.363/.493/18

29) Walker Jenkins - MIN, OF, 20.1 - My Kyle Tucker comp for Jenkins last off-season turned out to be eerily accurate, at least for what they each did in their first full year of pro ball as 19 year old's. Tucker had 9 homers with 32 steals and a 16.3/10.1 K%/BB% in 117 games in the lower minors, while Jenkins had 6 homers with 17 steals and a 12.8/15.2 K%/BB% in 82 games. Like Jenkins, Tucker also wasn't a burner, and nobody really expected the steal totals to stick in the majors, but they did. And like Jenkins, the only thing that hadn't fully developed yet was the power, but Tucker had a monster power explosion the very next season, hitting 25 homers in 120 games split between High-A and Double-A. I see no reason why Jenkins can't have that same power explosion at 6'3'', 210 pounds with one of the sweetest lefty swings this game has ever seen. He doesn't hit the ball on the ground too much and he can pull it, so while his hard hit numbers weren't too impressive, they weren't too bad either, and it would be pretty shocking if he didn't develop impact power. He's on a beeline for elite dynasty asset, and he's among the favorites to be the #1 prospect in baseball by the middle of 2025. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 103/27/96/.282/.365/.504/18

30) Teoscar Hernandez - LAD, OF, 32.6 - Teoscar's numbers tanked in 2023 playing in Seattle, one of the worst hitter's parks in the league, and it just makes you think what Julio could be capable of if he played in a better park. But back to Teoscar, not only did he bounce back with LA in 2024, he arguably had the best season of his career, slashing .272/.339/.501 with 33 homers, 12 steals, and a 28.8/8.1 K%/BB% in 154 games. As always he smashed the ball with plus bat speed and plus foot speed. He swings and misses a lot with a 34% whiff%, but he's been sitting there his entire career and he still has a career .263 BA in 3,861 PA, so I wouldn't be worried about that. Returning to the Dodgers (4th best park for righty homers in 2024) was the best case scenario for him. - 2025 Projection: 80/28/93/.261/.328/.490/9

31) Seiya Suzuki - CHC, OF, 30.8 - Seiya has a collection of skills that seems on the brink of absolutely exploding. He put up an 11.5% Barrel%, 91.7 MPH EV, 16.2 degree launch, 24.5% whiff%, 20.7% Chase%, 28.3 ft/sec sprint and a 73 MPH swing. He already did kinda quietly blow up in 2024 with a 138 wRC+, and while the power/speed numbers weren't off the charts with 21 homers and 16 steals in 132 games, both of those were career highs too. He's 30 years old, so it's hard to say I'm really expecting a true blow up, but at the same time, he only came stateside in 2022, so maybe there is more upside in here than your typical 30 year old. The floor is very high, and I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a special season or two here coming up. I like Suzuki a lot. 2025 Projection: 85/25/85/.270/.348/.478/14

32) Anthony Santander - TOR, OF, 30.6 - Santander hit a career high by far 44 homers, and it's pretty clearly a career year. All of his underlying numbers were in line with career norms, and his .345 wOBA was much better than his .324 xwOBA. That's not to say he isn't a power hitting beast, because he is with an 11.7% Barrel%, 94.6 MPH FB/LD, 22.7 degree launch, and 19.4% K%. He's going to rip homers no matter where he lands (the Blue Jays have an above average park for righty homers and a below average park for lefty homers), but it's going to come with a mediocre BA and OBP (hit hit .235 with a .308 OBP even in this career year), so I would shy away from overpaying based on the career year. 2025 Projection: 83/34/95/.249/.318/.480/3

33) Bryan Reynolds - PIT, OF, 30.2 - Just another year of putting in Yeoman's Work for Reynolds with a .275 BA, 24 homers and 10 steals in 156 games. It's not flashy but it was good enough to be a Top 50 dynasty player in 2024 (45th overall). He's so consistently boring with more or less these exact same numbers for the last 4 years. He put up a 118 wRC+ this year and he has a career 120 wRC+. He put up a .350 xwOBA this year and he has a career .354 xwOBA. Safe to say, I think you know what you are getting from Reynolds. 2025 Projection: 83/24/85/.271/.342/.454/10

34) Evan Carter - TEX, OF, 22.7 - Sometimes (or more like the vast majority of the time), general dynasty value and/or general dynasty rankings just isn't a great tool for how you should value players for your actual team. Take Evan Carter, who is certainly moving down rankings after an injured and down season, but if you were banking on him to be a core member of your future lineup, it doesn't make any sense at all to sell low right now. Even if there are real reasons to be worried, like having a bad back. His season ended on May 26th with a stress reaction in his back. It's his 2nd major back injury of his career as he suffered a stress fracture in his back in 2021 which kept him out for most of that season as well. He also didn't hit the ball nearly as hard in 2024 as he did in 2023 with a 86 MPH EV in 45 games. At a projectable 6'2'', 190 pounds, the hope was for him to add more power naturally as he got older, but the constant back injuries complicate that. Is he really going to want to add considerably more weight with a bad back? He also only attempted 2 steals in those 45 games, and again, with the bad back, is is possible he isn't really going to run a ton now? He deserves to take a tumble down the rankings, but back to my original point, it still doesn't make sense to sell low assuming you don't already have a stacked young hitting core. The back might fully heal, and at a still young 22 years old, he is in his prime healing age, so maybe that should be the expectation. The plate approach was still excellent even with the down year with an above average 23.4% whiff% and 18.5% Chase%. Maybe he ends up as more of a solid across the board type than truly impact across the board, but his trade value took such a big hit this year, that even if he doesn't hit his ceiling, you aren't going to get a fair return this year. Carter is a clear hold for me. 2025 Projection: 76/16/67/.249/.335/.410/15 Prime Projection: 91/22/72/.273/.361/.448/20

35) Emmanuel Rodriguez - MIN, OF, 22.1 - You can't talk about Rodriguez without talking about the fact that the guy is rarely on the field. He played in only 47 games this year due to a nagging thumb injury, and he played in only 47 games in 2022 due to a meniscus tear (knee). He did get in a mostly full season in 2023 though (he missed a few weeks with an abdominal strain), and he got in a full rookie ball season in 2021, so I'm hesitant to officially slap the injury prone label on him. It's something to take into account to break a tie, but his upside is way too high to meaningfully move him down the rankings because of it. He's a power/speed/OBP beast with 9 homers, 9 steals, and a .459 OBP at mostly Double-A in 47 games. It was good for a 203 wRC+ at the level. He crushes the ball, he lifts it, and he's an excellent athlete who plays CF. Injuries aren't the only concern though, he also has strikeout problems with a 29.7% K%. Some of it is because of how patient he is, but definitely not all of it. I wouldn't say Minnesota's OF is wide open, but Jeff Zimmerman's latest article just talked about how they want to limit Buxton to like 100-110 games next year, and while they have solid options for their corner spots, they are far from locked down. If Rodriguez is healthy and producing at Triple-A, it might not be long before he gets the call to the majors, and there is potential for monster fantasy impact, especially in an OBP league. - 2025 Projection: 36/10/31/.224/.310/435/8 Prime Projection: 92/29/89/.248/.342/.490/24

36) Josue De Paula - LAD, OF, 19.10 - De Paula doesn't truly get the hype that Walker Jenkins, Sebastian Walcott and Leo De Vries gets, but he deserves every little bit of it. He might have the best hit/approach/power combo of all of them, putting up a 19.8/17.5 K%/BB% with a 130 wRC+ in 107 games split between Single-A and High-A. His game power still hasn't exploded, but it ticked up from 2023 with 10 homers (2 homers in 2023), and he hits the ball so hard at 6'3'' that there is little doubt about his power potential. He doesn't sell out for power, and his groundball and pull rates are fine, so he has the potential to be one of those special monster triple-slash middle of the order mashers. He's not a burner, but he went 27 for 30 on the bases, so the guy is obviously a good athlete who knows how to steal a base. He's not a good defensive player, but with his potentially elite bat, I'm not scared off by that. He won't get ranked as highly on real life lists as those aforementioned teenagers, but don't let you think that Josue isn't on that level. He's an elite  lower minors prospect. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 92/26/94/.276/.364/.482/14

37) Max Clark - DET, OF, 20.3 - Clark was the 3rd overall pick in a stacked 2023 draft class, and he played exactly as advertised in his first full season of pro ball, slashing .279/.372/.421 with 9 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.2/12.4 K%/BB% in 107 games split between Single-A (134 wRC+) and High-A (119 wRC+). He's an absolutely electric player when you watch him with a vicious lefty swing and plus speed. He's already one of the more exciting top of the order prospects in the lower minors, and when gains more power naturally, and starts lifting the ball a bit more (48% GB%), he can explode into a truly elite prospect. His hype has actually been relatively subdued considering how much pre draft hype he got, but make no mistake, Clark can be special. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 96/20/69/.277/.351/.443/30

38) Cody Bellinger - NYY, OF/1B, 29.9 - When you have a 90.6 MPH FB/LD EV with a 17.4 degree launch, you are going to be highly dependent on how juicy the baseballs are in any given season (I talked a lot about this last year, and I think nobody really knows how each season's baseballs are going to play exactly, including MLB executives, until they roll them out and see), and with the baseballs not being as juicy in 2024 as they were in 2023, Bellinger's homer totals dropped from 26 in 130 games in 2023 to 18 in 130 games in 2024. His Barrel% and FB EV were very close to identical, so it was as perfect of an example of the balls as can be. The good news is that his much improved contact rates from 2023 transferred completely with a 15.6% K%, so that helps both his BA and homer power play up. He didn't run much last year with only 9 steals in 11 attempts, but he's still fast with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint, so that is on the low end of expectations. And the best news of all is that he got traded to a ballpark that is perfect for his profile. He needs that Yankee Stadium short porch more than anyone. After such an insane start to his career, it is a bit underwhelming to see him settle in as a solid across the board contributor in his "prime" years, but with that short porch, it gives just a glimmer of hope that a big year could be in the cards if things fall right. 2025 Projection: 79/24/86/.266/.325/.450/14

39) Mike Trout - LAA, OF, 33.8 - Trout's season ended on April 29th with a meniscus tear which required surgery. He tried to return later in the season, suffered a setback, and then underwent another meniscus surgery. It's unfortunately par for the course as Trout just can't stay healthy with calf, back, wrist and now the knee knocking him out for huge chunks of time over the last 4 years. The good news is that the Angels are finally going to move him off CF, using him in a corner or as a DH in an attempt to keep him healthy. Who knows if it will work, but at least it's something to hang your hat on. And most importantly, he keeps producing when he is on the field. He was the fastest player to 10 homers in 2024, and he even started running again with 6 steals in 29 games. His 17.1% Barrel%, 28.9 ft/sec sprint, .405 xwOBA and 21.4 K% are all right in line with his prime levels. And the clear indicator that he is still a beast is a 75.7 MPH swing that is truly elite. He's not likely to put up the BA and OBP he put up in his prime, but it sure seems like this guy could hit 40 homers in his sleep, assuming he can actually stay healthy. I think just about any name value has been squeezed out of Trout's value due to the constant injuries, so I see him as a fairly priced veteran power bat with injury risk. - 2025 Projection: 76/32/78/.268/.359/.515/5

40) Josh Lowe - TBR, OF, 27.2 - Lowe couldn't back up his 2023 breakout in 2024 with a .693 OPS in 106 games, but everything we loved coming into the season is still there. He put up a 90.8/94.3 MPH AVG/FB EV with a 16.9 degree launch, so hitting only 10 homers seems like the very, very bottom of his true talent level, and now moving into Steinbrenner Field (which supposedly has the same dimensions as Yankee Stadium), he's going to get a ballpark boost too. He's also an excellent base runner with 25 steals in 26 attempts. That is a special power/speed combo that is not easy to find. The hit tool is the problem of course, and while his K% jumped from 24.8% to 31.8%, his 31.8% whiff% basically remained the same, so I think he should settle somewhere in between those two numbers going forward. And he struggles vs lefties (.547 OPS), but he hit better against them in 2023, and even in some kind of platoon, his upside is high enough to not be too scared off by that. He's not without his flaws, but Lowe's power/speed combo is too special to sell low, and he's in fact a buy low for me this off-season. There is "league winning" (we all know one player can't win you your league) upside in here, and that is something I'm going after. - 2025 Projection: 77/21/74/.249/.313/.436/31

41) Heliot Ramos - SFG, OF, 25.7 - When you dive into the bat tracking data, Ramos is one of the true standouts, if not the very top standout. Both his 75.2 MPH swing speed and 6.9 foot swing length are truly elite. Nobody is even close to as good at him in swing speed/length combo. The ones who are closest are Bobby Witt Jr., Wyatt Langford, Corbin Carroll, Colton Cowser, Lawrence Butler, and Brent Rooker. Not bad company, but again, he tops all of them. My point is, Ramos has a truly special bat. And his 2024 rookie year backed up that evaluation with a 120 wRC+, 14.5% Barrel% and 22 homers in 121 games. The sad part is, that isn't half as good as what he could have done if he didn't have San Francisco's horrific ballpark to deal with. He cracked 14 homers in 58 games on the road vs. only 8 homers in 63 games at home. If he played nearly anywhere else, I might have messed around and put him nearly in my Top 100. But he doesn't play anywhere else, and along with the ballpark, there are hit tool issues with a 26.1/7.7 K%/BB%. He also only stole 6 bags, but he has some speed with a 27.9 ft/sec sprint, he ran a bit more in his minor league career, and he only got caught stealing once, so I wouldn't rule out maybe some 15 steal seasons. Even with SF to contend with, I just can't overlook how special of a talent Ramos is. I'm targeting him despite the park. - 2025 Projection: 76/27/91/.264/.329/.473/11

42) Colton Cowser - BAL, OF, 25.0 - I wish Cowser ran more and/or was a better base stealer (9 for 13 on the bases in 153 games), because then I would really love his profile. He didn't run all that much in the upper minors either, and it doesn't seem like we can count on much more than the 10 steals range. The reason I want to see more steals is because he also doesn't have a good enough hit tool to be a positive contributor in that category. He hit .242 with a 30.7% K% and he had a pretty significantly high K% throughout his minor league career too. The last negative is that he doesn't hit lefties well, and while I don't think he's going to be a platoon player as he's good on defense and he should only improve against them, it's definitely something to note. But the trifecta of what he does well is a very powerful trifecta. He crushes the ball with a 13.6% Barrel%, 90.5/95.6 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13 degree launch, and 46.1% Hard Hit%. It led to 24 homers. He gets on base with a strong plate approach, putting up a 9.3% BB% and 25% Chase%. And he has well above average speed with a 28.2 ft/sec sprint. He's going to do damage, and if it came with more steals (or a better BA), you could really fall in love here, but because it doesn't, it caps his upside enough to not get too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 84/27/82/.253/.338/.472/11

43) Chase DeLauter - CLE, OF, 23.6 - I don't know if DeLauter needs to stop missing leg day at the gym, or by looking at the size of those trunks, maybe he needs to skip more leg days, but he has to figure out a way to keep the gams healthy. He broke his foot pre draft in 2022 which required surgery, and then he broke that same foot this year while running the bases. This one didn't require surgery and wasn't as serious, but at 6'3'', 235 pounds, those feet are going to continue to take a beating. He was able to return from the 2nd broken foot only to have a hamstring strain end his regular season about one month later. He's in the AFL now, so that also wasn't serious, but the injuries are starting to get concerning. They seemed to have stopped him from running at all this year with only 1 steal in 45 total games. The injuries haven't stopped him from raking though. The hit tool and plate approach look truly elite with a 13.4/11.6 K%/BB%, and he has big power with 7 homers in 36 upper minors games. One of those homers was an inside the park job, which showed off his athleticism. He's a special talent with above average to plus across the board skills, but he has to stay healthy, and staying healthy looks like it might entail not stealing a ton of bases, which does hurt the fantasy value a bit. - 2025 Projection: 66/19/72/.256/.320/.439/6 Prime Projection: 90/27/88/.278/.351/.484/10

44) Jordan Walker - STL, OF, 22.10 - Walker is still just 22 years old. The Cards called him up so quickly it feels like he should be in his mid 20's by now, but I just want to reiterate how young he still is. And I want to reiterate that, because I now want to iterate what an insanely tremendous athlete he is. His 77.3 MPH swing is in truly rarified air. Elite of the elite. His 28.4 ft/sec sprint is firmly plus. He's 6'6'', 250 pounds. In no world am I giving up on this man when he is still just 22 years old. and not only that, he has an above average 104 wRC+ in 168 MLB games. Even with his terrible 2024, he smashed the ball with a 91.2 MPH EV and 9.5% Barrel%. He has some hit tool issues, but they really aren't all that bad as he's had respectable K rates basically his entire career being young for every level. There are some launch issues too, but like the K issues, they really aren't that bad with a 10 degree launch in the majors. This is an insane talent and his two biggest weaknesses aren't even that bad. And he's still 22 years old. St. Louis also announced they are going to give him a full leash in 2024 to figure it out. No way I'm giving up on him right now. Strong hold at the least, and buy at the best. 2025 Projection: 73/22/79/.246/.313/.431/9 Prime Projection: 84/28/89/.263/.332/.471/12

45) Justin Crawford - PHI, OF, 21.3 - Crawford is just raw talenting his way through the minor leagues with elite bloodlines and elite talent an uber athletic 6'2'', 188 pounds. He slashed .313/.360/.444 with 9 homers, 42 steals, and an 18.7/6.4 K%/BB% in 110 games split between High-A and Double-A. He was even better at Double-A than he was at High-A with a 140 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed, he hits the ball hard, and he has a good feel to hit. It's pure talent baby, but if he doesn't start to refine his game, it will eventually catch up to him. He has an extreme 61% GB% and he chases a ton. Good defense and good pitchers, which he will find in the majors, are better able to take advantage of that than minor leaguers. But if he can start to refine his game, and at only 21 years old, I don't see why he wouldn't, watch the hell out. The upside is a legit elite dynasty asset, and while I wouldn't bet on him reaching that lofty ceiling, he can be a game changing fantasy player with even a moderately good outcome. I think there is too much focus on his deficiencies, and not enough focus on what he does well. I love him. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 86/17/64/.273/.322/.420/39

46) Jaison Chourio - CLE, OF, 19.10 - Chourio gets plenty of love, but I'm not sure it's nearly enough. A lot of his love gets couched in "but he's not as good as his brother," which isn't quite fair, because I think there is near elite prospect upside in here, and he took steps towards that in 2024. His power didn't explode (yet), but it did tick up with 5 homers in 98 games at Single-A (1 homer was his previous career high). He's a still projectable 6'1'' with an explosive swing, so as he gains more raw power, and as he raises his launch (49.3% GB%), there could be a real power breakout coming down the line. And he has the elite plate skills (16.0/`19.9 K%/BB%) and speed (44 steals) to do the rest. He's yet to put up less than a 140 wRC+ at any stop of his career. This is easily a Top 30 fantasy prospect for me, and even that could be underselling him. If he gets lukewarm love in off-season prospect drafts where he's available, you need to jump all over that. Now is the time to target him aggressively. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 98/18/68/.276/.355/.433/34

47) Steven Kwan - CLE, OF, 27.7 - Kwan's season perfectly encapsulated why I don't like going after hit tool first guys. He had a .389 BA in the first 50 games of the season, and then put up a .220 BA in his final 72 games. You are just way too much at the mercy of the BABIP gods. And the BABIP gods are fickle B's. He hit a career high 14 homers, and that is semi backed up by a career high 2.6% Barrel% and 14.9 degree launch, but that number is at the top end of his ability. And worst of all, he stole only 12 bases in 17 attempts. Everyone and their grandmother is running like wild these days, so you can't even count on him to be a true impact contributor in steals. It's not that I don't see the appeal of a profile like this, it's just that I'm never even close to the high guy on it, so I never roster these players in dynasty. - 2025 Projection: 90/11/50/.289/.365/.408/18

48) Garrett Mitchell - MIL, OF, 26.7 - The new Statcast Bat Tracking data has been such a fun and valuable tool to dive into, and one of the top names to jump out on that list is Garrett Mitchell. He swings an electric bat with a 75.7 MPH swing that is 27th fastest in baseball, and that is with players that have swung the bat even a single time. Bump the threshold up to 100 swings and he ranks 22nd. He combines the elite bat speed with an elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed which is in the top 5% of baseball. He's simply one of the most electric players in the game, and it unsurprisingly resulted in a very good season. He slashed .255/.342/.469 with 8 homers, 11 steals, and a 31.7/11.2 K%/BB% in 69 games. It was good for a 126 wRC+. Like many players who swing that fast, he misses a lot too with a 34.3% whiff%, but that has been headed in the right direction in his career, and he has a career 19.8% K% in 40 games at Triple-A, so I do think there is potential for that to continue to improve. He's also hitting .264 in 365 career MLB PA, so I don't think the hit tool is as risky as it seems. He hits the ball on the ground too much with a career 4.9 degree launch, but with his speed and hard hit ability, he can easily make that profile work (as he has been). I named him a major target at mid-season before he got called up to the majors, and I'll be naming him a target again this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 81/18/72/.248/.330/.447/26

49) Parker Meadows - DET, OF, 25.5 - If you would have told me that Meadows would put up a 111 wRC+ last off-season when I named him a major target, I would have assumed he was going to be a major hit for me, but we all know it wasn't quite that easy. He struggled hard in his first 32 games with a .096 BA, which resulted in him getting banished back to the minors. Depending on the league, many people probably dropped him or sold low by that time, and I sure as hell already given all my mea culpas and my bads on naming him a target. But he didn't hang his head when he got sent down, putting up a 130 wRC+ in 51 games, and then he carried that over when he got called back up to the majors, slashing .300/.344/.513 with 7 homers, 6 steals, and a 20.7/6.6 K%/BB% in his final 50 games (plus a 131 wRC+ with 3 steals and 1 homer in 7 playoff games). The same profile I loved last off-season is still present with a 18.6 degree launch, 29.3 ft/sec sprint, 27% whiff%, and 25.8% Chase%. He's also a plus CF. The one problem is that he doesn't hit the ball very hard. He had a 87/91.6 MPH AVG/LD EV with a 37.3% Hard Hit%. Even during his hot 2nd half he wasn't hitting the ball all that hard. It's a recipe for a low batting average, but the homer/steal combo has enough upside to make up for it. While it doesn't feel right to say Meadows was a hit in 2024, it also doesn't feel right to say he was a miss. I'll call it a draw, and we'll let 2025 break the tie, because I'm definitely still in on him. Let's run it back ... - 2025 Projection: 82/20/71/.248/.320/.432/23

50) Kerry Carpenter - DET, OF, 27.7 - Carpenter was a major target for me last off-season, writing, "Carpenter has a pretty rare, very hard to find profile that can usually only be found at the top of drafts, but he gets valued like a boring afterthought. He had a 10.2% Barrel%, 90.1/95.1 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.1 degree launch, 28.1 ft/sec sprint, and 27% whiff%. I promise you, those are not easy numbers to find." ...  I knew that collection of skills was special, and then he went out and proved it in 2024 with a .385 xwOBA, .932 OPS, and 18 homers in 87 games. And the underlying numbers looked even better this year with a 17.7% Barrel%, 90.5/94.9 MPH AVG/FB EV, 17.6 degree launch, 27.7 ft/sec sprint, and 30.3% whiff%. That whiff% is higher than optimal, he was atrocious vs. lefties (.408 OPS in only 32 PA, meaning he was platooning), and he's not a good defensive player, so he has his warts, but I'll say it again, this is a very impressive hitting profile. Even in a platoon role, he could very easily hit 30+ bombs next year, and I'm not so sure his bat is going to get relegated to a strict platoon role. - 2025 Projection: 76/30/91/.262/.320/.506/5

51) Konnor Griffin - PIT, OF, 18.11 - Selected 9th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Griffin has the highest pure upside in this entire draft. He's 6'4'', 215 pounds and has the look of a #1 overall pick in the NFL Draft as a QB. He has the neck of a football player too. He also has the athleticism of a football player with legit potential to put up 30/30 seasons with a plus to double plus power/speed combo. He's shown a good feel to hit with a good plate approach in his high school career, but like I mentioned back in February 2024 when I did a very early Top 10 FYPD Ranking, the swing isn't necessarily the smoothest thing in the world, although it actually looks much better to me now than it did then. Plus you can tack on electric bat speed and bank on continued refinement considering how young he is for the class. Pitt obviously wasn't worried enough about the hit tool to let him slip by them at #9, and for fantasy especially, I wouldn't let it scare you off him either. This is legit elite dynasty asset potential. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 89/25/92/.261/.337/.470/33

52) Adolis Garcia - TEX, OF, 32.1 - I'm getting a lot of questions from teams that are shopping Garcia this off-season, and the trade offers are in the toilet. If you own Garcia, you have probably identified him as someone you could move this off-season, but it makes zero sense to move him coming off this down season. He still hit the ball tremendously hard with a 91.0/95.5 MPH AVG/FB EV, and while the plate approach wasn't good with a 27.8/7.1 K%/BB%, it's never been good, so that is just part of his game. I definitely get wanting to sell him, because there are signs of real physical decline (his speed has declined for the 4th straight year with a now below average 26.8 ft/sec sprint), but it makes much more sense to wait for when he's (hopefully) raking during the season. He's "only" 32, and with how hard he hits the ball, he shouldn't fall off a cliff in 2025, so the smarter bet would be to wait to deal him, because the offers you are getting now are probably trash. - 2025 Projection: 79/30/93/.240/.306/.464/11

53) Randy Arozarena - SEA, OF, 30.1 - Seattle is where hitters go to die, and while Arozarena's 122 wRC+ with Seattle was actually better than the 109 wRC+ he put up with Tampa, the power/speed combo wasn't nearly as good with 5 homers and 4 steals in 54 games. You can't count on him for BA (.219 BA with a 26.1% K% in 2024), so with the game power upside now subdued in Seattle, it puts a cap on his upside. He's also a bad base stealer (20 for 30 in 2024) and is entering his 30's, so there is potential for that to fall off a cliff as well if he starts running less. He still hits the ball very hard with a 90.4 MPH EV and he gets on base with a 11.3% BB%, so he should still be a good fantasy player, but I'm starting to see more downside than upside. I wouldn't call him a sell, especially coming off the mediocre year, but I still think his perceived value is a bit higher than how I would value right now. 2025 Projection: 81/20/70/.247/.344/.429/19

54) Tyler O’Neill - BAL, OF, 29.9 - O'Neill signed a 3 year, $49.5 million contract with Baltimore, and while his power could conquer any ballpark, those LF walls coming back in will only help. I thought Baltimore would prioritize pitching in free agency with how stacked their offensive minor league system is, but I can't argue with adding a bat like O'Neill, and it could open things up for them in the pitching trade market as well. Kjerstad must be sitting there and saying what do I have to do to get a shot. This signing definitely hurts Kjerstad's value right now, but you have to think he is prime trade bait, so I don't want to overreact. As for O'Neill, the man is going to hit dingers with 31 homers, a 17.3% Barrel%, 90.9/96.5 MPH AVG/FB EV, and a 20.2 degree launch in 113 games. His days of running seems to be over with only 4 steals, he's not going to hit for a high BA with a 33.6% K%, and he's been banged up his entire career, so games played are a concern as well. 2025 Projection: 75/30/81/.237/.321/.479/6

55) Lane Thomas - CLE, OF, 29.7 - The biggest question with Thomas is how much Cleveland is going to let him run. He stole 28 bags in 77 games with Washington and only 4 bags in 53 games with Cleveland. He's not the best base stealer in the world, he's alright at best, so that pretty stark contrast in steals is concerning for fantasy. And his hit tool, approach, and power are not quite good enough to really make up for that. He's average-ish in all of those areas give or take. I still like his collection of underlying skills with contact (23.3% whiff%), lack of Chase (22.9%), speed (29.3 ft/sec sprint), launch (17 degree launch), and hard hit (40.6%), so I think he's capable of some monster fantasy seasons (28/20 in 2023 and 15/32 in 2024), but if Cleveland doesn't let him run as much, the profile starts to look lacking, and he'll turn 30 during the 2025 season. - 2025 Projection: 76/20/76/.247/.313/.425/20

56) Ian Happ - CHC, OF, 30.8 - Happ raised his launch to a 5 year high of 15.1 degrees, and it resulted in a career high 25 homers. He's always hit the ball very hard, so that bump in launch was just what the doctored ordered to give him that little bit of upside edge that he needed. He raised his launch every year over the last 5 years, so that gives hope this isn't a one year glitch. OBP leagues are where he really shines with a .341 OPB and 12.2% BB%, so in OBP leagues this is a damn good all category contributor, and easily a Top 100 dynasty asset, if not higher. The .243 BA and 25.6% K% holds his upside down a bit in 5x5 BA, but he's still really good in that format as well. 2025 Projection: 85/23/81/.251/.348/.443/11

57) Christian Yelich - MIL, OF, 33.4 - Just when we thought we were out of the woods, the damn back got Yelich again, undergoing season ending back surgery in August which put an end to a great season. He put up a 153 wRC+ with 11 homers and 22 steals in just 73 games. The .373 xwOBA and 28.5 ft/sec sprint backed up the surface stats. If not for the back injury, he was looking like a near elite win now piece, but I gotta say I'm scared off by the surgery. He's 33 years old and he's been dealing with a bad back for years now. I think his name value and great 2024 is going to keep his price very high, and in dynasty, I'm just not willing to pay that price with the back risk. 2025 Projection: 83/16/69/.274/.366/.439/20

58) Michael Toglia - COL, 1B/OF, 26.8 - Tyler Soderstrom is my 2024 version of Mark Vientos, because Vientos "came out of nowhere" and Soderstrom fits that a bit better, but Toglia is most definitely one of my top power bat targets for 2025. He put up a 17.3% Barrel% in 116 games. I mean, I could honestly end the blurb right there. Go get this man ... but I'll continue. His 92.1/95.7 MPH AVG/FB EV is beastly, which he combines with a 15.1 degree launch. He swings a quick bat with a 73.2 MPH swing, and it's not very long either at 7.5 feet. The hit tool is definitely an issue with a 32.1% K%, 34.9% whiff%, and .218 BA, but Coors Field will give him all the help he can get there, and his .244 xBA isn't bat at all. The hit tool risk is also fully factored into his current price, and I would argue overly factored in. He also stole 10 bags in 11 attempts (in only 116 games), which is an nice little bonus to offset the low BA. And in OBP leagues he's an even bigger target with an 11.8% BB%. I'm willing to take on the batting average risk when the power upside is so high. I'm going after Toglia. 2025 Projection: 77/31/89/.232/.320/.475/9

59) Brandon Nimmo - NYM, OF, 32.0 - Nimmo stole a career high by far 15 bags in 151 games out of nowhere. He stole 3 in 2023 and 2022. He was also a perfect 15 for 15, and he was a terrible base stealer every other year of his career. It's almost like some players didn't prepare for the new rules in 2023, saw everyone else run wild, and then they were like, hey, I can do that too. And with a 28 ft/sec sprint, maybe he can keep up at least a large portion of the gains. He also backed up his power uptick from 2023 with a 9.1% Barrel%, 91.9 MPH EV, and 11.2 degree launch. A BABIP induced .224 BA was the only issue with his season, and without poor luck, he would have easily had yet another season of around a 130 wRC+. Nimmo has a career 128 wRC+ in 911 games. Come to think of it, is he the most underappreciated hitter of this generation? He's been consistently great his entire career, but this level up in power seems legit, and he finally learned how to steal bags. I actually don't think a monster season is out of the question this year. And add two stars in OBP leagues as a lot of the career wRC+ is due to double plus walk rates. - 2025 Projection: 91/23/86/.258/.349/.451/9

60) Jorge Soler - LAA, OF, 33.1 - Soler got traded out of San Francisco, and magically the power returned with 9 homers in 49 games with Atlanta and only 12 homers in 93 games with SF (and only 4 homers in 49 games at SF-Oracle Park). This is why I like Conforto so much. Bad ballparks can simply crush power hitters. Soler signed with the Angels this off-season (Top 10 ballpark for righty homers), so he landed in a great spot. He absolutely crushes the ball with a 12.6% Barrel%, 90.5 MPH EV, and an elite 75.4 MPH swing, he lifts it with a 17.9 degree launch, and his contact rates have stabilized for a while now with a 24.6/11.8 K%/BB%. I'm looking at the Angels lineup right now, and I actually like it a ton if things breaking right. Trout can't stay healthy and Neto already might not be ready for the start of the season, so banking on things breaking right might not be a good bet, but I'm just saying. Christian Moore is waiting in the wings too, and Mathew Lugo ain't chopped liver either. They signed Kikuchi, Soriano is a favorite of mine, and they have pretty damn good rotation depth in the minors. It's not a high end rotation, but it's kinda deep. I gotta say, with a Win O/U at 71.5, that could be my favorite O/U on the slate. I can't in good conscious recommend you follow in my footsteps, but I'm in on that (and you know I'm crazy enough I'll pop that WS long shot bet on them too ha). - 2025 Projection: 80/28/80/.242/.330/.471/1

61) Michael Conforto - LAD, OF, 32.1 - If you missed out on Teoscar Hernandez' monster bounce back season, the universe is giving you another chance this off-season to rectify that mistake. It is nearly an exact replica of the Teoscar situation with Conforto this off-season. The Dodgers signed Conforto to a 1 year, $17 million contract, and it's almost like nobody else in baseball understands how ballpark factors work. I'm starting to think the Dodgers are so "smart" only relative to how dumb everyone else is. Conforto goes from the 28th worst park for lefty homers (SF) to the 6th best. He hit 3 homers at home vs. 17 on the road. I mean, come on. Could it get anymore obvious? Yes. Yes it can. He had a 11.8% Barrel%, a 90.2/95.4 MPH AVG/LD EV, 14.8 degree launch, a 74.1 MPH swing, and 24.2/8.6 K%/BB%. And he actually hit lefties better than righties last year, so there isn't that much platoon risk. There was no team out there willing to give him a 2 or 3 year deal? You let the Dodgers just do it again? He's a major win now buy target going for a song of a price (still only 280th overall NFBC ADP over the last month). 2025 Projection: 77/25/84/.250/.338/.468/2

62) Matt Wallner - MIN, OF, 27.3 - Wallner has 580 PA in his 3 year career and is slashing .251/.366/.500 with 29 homers, 6 steals, and a 34.5/10.0 K%/BB%. It's good for a 144 wRC+. I mean, that is no joke. His 77.2 MPH swing is in the elite of the elite, and he utterly smashes the ball with a 17.5% Barrel% and 92.8 MPH EV. Yea, the strikeout rate is high, and yea, he doesn't hit lefties well, but this is an absolutely extraordinary power hitter. Even in a platoon role, I almost don't see how he wouldn't crack 30 homers, and while the counterargument is that you have to make contact in order to hit homers, he has a career .251 BA in a not that small of a sample. I see the negatives, but I don't know, that upside is too high for me to focus on them. I'm in on Wallner. - 2025 Projection: 72/30/83/.241/.348/.491/5

63) Jo Adell - LAA, OF, 26.0 - I feel crazy for even saying this, but I think Jo Adell is a target for me this off-season. I know, I know, even saying it out loud sounds downright silly, but hear me out. He just put up a .312 xwOBA in 130 games, which is nearly average, and he massively improved his contact rates with a 29.8% whiff% (38.5% in 2023) and 27.9% K% (40.3% in 2023). Nobody doubts his humongous talent, but just in case you need a reminder, his 76.7 MPH swing is 5th best in all of baseball. The names around him on that leaderboard are Stanton, Oneil Cruz, Schwarber, Judge, Chapman, Yordan, Ohtani, Julio, and Gunnar. The only qualified hitter in that area who wasn't good was Christopher Morel. If you lower the minimum qualification you will get more hit tool busts like Adell, but point being it shows off legit monster talent. And he has the EV to back it up with a 89.8/96.4 MPH AVG/FB EV. That FB EV is near elite. He also has plus speed with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint. He only hit .207 with a 90 wRC+ on the season, but he slashed .253/.341/.440 with 6 homers, 5 steals, and a 25.3/10.0 K%/BB% in his final 46 games before his season ended with an oblique injury. It can often take uber athletes into their mid to late 20's to figure out the hit tool, but when they do, it can pay off huge. It sure seems like Adell took a big step forward there in 2024. I know I'm going to end up regretting this, hah, but boy do I like Adell a lot right now relative to his perceived value. - 2025 Projection: 72/26/81/.237/.310/.449/15

64) Nolan Jones - COL, OF, 26.10 - Jones had a bad back basically the entire season, and he played like a guy who had a bad back. You can see the underlying skills were still there and still solid, but the impact and explosion was completely non existent. The Barrel% tanked from 15.7% to 5.9%, despite a still solid 88.2/93.3 MPH AVG/FB EV. The steals dropped from 20 in 106 games to 5 in 79 games, despite a still solid 28.1 ft/sec sprint. And as we've seen with Yelich's bad back, he struggled to keep the launch up, with it dropping from 9.8 degrees to 7.8 degrees. The skills were in there, but the explosion was gone. The one positive takeaway from his season is that despite still striking out 30.6% of the time, he brought his whiff% way down to 25.6% (31.9% in 2023). That does take some of the edge off the hit tool downside, even though it's obviously still a risk. And his plate approach remained excellent with a 23.1% Chase% and 12.1% BB%. If the back is completely healthy, and that explosion returns, the huge season we were expecting out of Jones in 2024 can easily still happen in 2025. The problem is that we know back injuries can linger, and it's no guarantee he's completely healthy. Jones is a strong hold for me. I can't say I'm particularly going after him, but I would really want to give him one more year before making any drastic decisions. - 2025 Projection: 76/20/76/.245/.342/.433/14

65) Dalton Rushing - LAD, C/OF, 24.1 - It seems that LA is set on keeping Rushing at catcher, which I completely understand for real life value, but for fantasy, I don't think it's great. Will Smith is signed until 2034, meaning Rushing looks ticketed for some kind of hybrid C/1B/OF/DH role, and with how hard it is to crack the Dodgers full time lineup (and with how little leash they give their prospects due to unlimited resources and strong organizational depth), it seems like Rushing is going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. They are not rolling out the red carpet for him at all, and I do think it hurts his fantasy value a bit. Putting defense aside for now, as a pure hitter, there is so much to like. He proved himself in the upper minors in 2024, slashing .271/.385/.512 with 26 homers, 2 steals, and a 20.5/12.7 K%/BB% in 114 games split between Double-A (149 wRC+) and Triple-A (128 wRC+). He has easy plus power with a 90.8 MPH EV, he has a launch made for both power and average, and he has a plus plate approach. The hit tool is solid, but I can see that dipping to below average against major league pitching, and like I mentioned earlier, we have seen LA be very quick with the hook if young players aren't producing. I like the bat a ton, but defense, path to playing time, and the slight hit tool questions are enough to make me hesitant to really value him at a premium right now. - 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.242/.310/.428/1 Prime Projection: 78/24/83/.262/.339/.465/2

66) Zyhir Hope - LAD, OF, 20.2 - And this is why "In the Dodgers We Trust" is a dynasty motto that should be burned into our retinas. They take Hope, and turn it into reality. Hope was a high risk, high reward upside pick by the Cubs in 2023 who struck out 30.2% of the time in rookie ball in his pro debut. He got traded to the Dodgers in the off-season in the Michael Busch trade, and of course the Dodgers immediately drastically improved his only weakness, bringing the strikeout rate all the way down to 22.8% at mostly Single-A. There is still hit tool risk (he hit .228 with a 24.3% K% in 23 games in the AFL), but low to mid 20's hit tool risk is in an entirely other bucket than hovering around 30% hit tool risk. And the hit tool improved without impacting any other areas of his game, slashing .290/.419/.484 with 9 homers, 9 steals, a 22.8/15.1 K%/BB% and a 144 wRC+ in 61 games. The reasons he's not ranked even higher than this are because the ground ball rates are on the high side (45.1%), there is still hit tool risk, and his speed/stolen base skills seem to be more in the above average than truly great area. So a guy who swings and misses a lot, hits the ball on the ground, and doesn't run quite as much as we would like isn't necessarily a slam dunk. I'm saying this just as much to myself as I am to you, because it's hard not to fall head over heels for him. He hits the ball very hard, he's a great athlete, he's in a great organization, and he's done nothing but produce. I do feel some caution is warranted before really putting him into that near elite to elite prospect tier, but he's not too far off from that already. I'm thinking something like Randy Arozarena could be a good ceiling comp. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/22/81/.255/.338/.445/19

67) Lazaro Montes - SEA, OF, 20.5 - Montes has three big negatives that prevent me from ranking him even higher than this. The first is that the hit tool is a real concern with a 26.1% K% in his 1,067 PA career in the lower minors. The 2nd is that Seattle is simply an awful ballpark to hit in. And the third is that he's a very bad defensive player, and could end up DH only. That puts a ton of pressure on the bat, and as a lefty who hits righties much better than lefties, a strong side of a platoon power bat seems well within the range of outcomes. I do find it interesting that Bryce Eldridge has a nearly identical profile, and Eldridge is the darling of the prospect world while people seem lukewarm on Montes these days. I also prefer Eldridge, because the hit tool seems a bit safer, he's a true unicorn at 6'7'', and he at least seems to have found a defensive home at 1B, but Montes is right there with him. He has beastly power at 6'3'', 210 pounds with 21 homers in 116 games, he's an on base machine with a 14.4% BB%, and while the K% spiked to 29.6% when he got the call to High-A, it was starting to come down towards the end of the season, and seeing the 19.1% K% he put up at Single-A shows hope that he can improve that skill over time. He's one of the premier lower minors power hitting prospects in the game, and his hype deserves to be damn close, if not equal to Eldridge's, but the prospect world can be a fickle place. Even my ranking has a disparity between them, Maybe it's just the nature of rankings. They are imperfect. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/33/95/.246/.333/.490/4

68) Jacob Melton - HOU, OF, 24.7 - Houston's OF is nothing but opportunity right now, with not a single locked in OF starter on the roster, which means Melton is going to get all of the opportunity he can handle in the coming years. And considering how great of an athlete he is, I love the leash he is almost certain to get. He's 6'2'', 208 pounds with plus speed and above average power. He cracked 15 homers with 30 steals in 105 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The reason why I'm so excited by the opportunity and leash, is that he might need it as the hit tool and plate approach are below average with a 23.5/7.0 K%/BB%. He's also not a huge lift and pull guy, which isn't the worst thing for his type of profile (speed and hard hit ability), and it doesn't go extreme in the way direction either, so I'm not too worried about that. Is it possible he ends up a kinda fringy major leaguer who shows flashes but just doesn't have the hit/plate approach to thrive? For sure that is a very realistic outcome. But I lean upside for fantasy, which Melton has plenty of, and when you combine it with proximity and opportunity, that is a profile I want on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 21/6/24/.228/.292/.402/8 Prime Projection: 77/19/75/.248/.319/.438/24

69) Byron Buxton - MIN, OF, 31.4 - It was announced that the Twins want to limit Buxton to about 100 games in order to keep him healthy, and since that seems to be just about as many as he could play anyway, I guess that makes sense. Either way, due to choice or injuries, the limited amount of games we can back on Buxton playing holds back his fantasy value majorly. This man could have been a fantasy beast with full health, because he crushes the ball (13.2% Barrel%) in the air (19.8 degree launch) with elite speed (29.7 ft/sec sprint). The below average hit tool is his only other demerit with a 25.5/5.2 K%/BB% and 32.1% whiff%, but that is good enough to let an elite power/speed combo shine. And the injuries have prevented him from running as much as he should with just 7 steals in 102 games. Those 102 games were a 7 year high by the way. A low BA slugger with a handful steals playing in 100 games can only get ranked so high, no matter how high the upside feels. - 2025 Projection: 70/24/70/.248/.314/.491/10

70) Heston Kjerstad - BAL, 1B/OF, 26.1 - Baltimore just doesn't seem interested in the slightest to give Kjerstad a real shot. He's once again blocked after the Tyler O'Neill signing. It seems obvious they want to use him as trade bait, but I guess nobody has bitten so far (that could change as they are still on the hunt for pitching). It's a shame, because he's clearly overdo for his shot. He smoked Triple-A with 16 homers, a 26.0/12.4 K%/BB%, and a 152 wRC+ in 56 games. It came with a 90.7 MPH EV and 16.8 degree launch. And then he was really good in the majors with 4 homers, a 116 wRC+ and 90.2 MPH EV in 114 PA. The swing and miss was on the high side with a 31.3% whiff% and 28.9% K%, but neither of those are too bad, and he also chased a lot with a 35% Chase%, so he needs to refine the plate skills, but that is to be expected with such little MLB experience. He's not a great defensive player, so he's definitely going to have to rake to hold down a job, but if he doesn't rake, it doesn't matter for us anyway. I love betting on the pedigree (2nd overall pick in the draft), history of production, and hard hit ability, but without opportunity, none of it matters. - 2025 Projection: 71/23/77/.250/.328/.440/3 (this assumes he gets traded to a situation where he can compete for a full time job. If he doesn't, you can half these projections at least)

71) Kevin Alcantara - CHC, OF, 22.8 - The Forgotten Unicorn continues to fly just low enough under the radar to not have the hype explode, while continuing to perform very well and show off his truly special tools. He's a still projectable 6'6'', 188 pounds with a double plus raw power/speed combo. He put up a 91 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 29.2 ft/sec sprint in the majors. And it's not like he's struggled in the minors at all, He's actually been extremely good his entire career, never putting up a wRC+ under 123 at any stop other than when he was a 16 year old in rookie ball. This year he did it in the upper minors all season as a 21/22 year old, slashing .278/.353/.428 with 14 homers, 14 steals, and a 26.0/9.9 K%/BB% in 111 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. The cherry on top is that he's a good CF, which could make a potent OF with PCA in center and Alcantara in a corner down the line. He's not a finished product with hit tool risk and too many groundballs, but his hype should be so much higher than it is. Alcantara makes for a great upside target. 2025 Projection: 22/7/29/.229/.294/.407/6 Prime Projection: 79/23/78/.251/.328/.449/18

72) Charlie Condon - COL, 3B/1B/OF, 21.11 - Let me just start by saying that I've been valuing pro debuts extremely high from the second I started writing back in 2015/16, and it has served me extremely well in both directions (moving guys both up and down). It was back before any other outlet would even consider changing their evaluation or ranking of a player based on their pro debut. When asked, they would just hand wave it away and say something like "small sample," even though the sample was often actually bigger in pro ball than it was in their Junior year of college (back when the draft was in early June). It made no sense to me why the pro debut with wood bats and more advanced pitching wouldn't be weighed more heavily. And now, you see basically every outlet change their ranking at least somewhat based on the pro debuts, which is the right move. That brings us to Charlie Condon, who just had the type of pro debut you have nightmares over. Despite all of his pre draft hype, he did have some hit tool questions at 6'6'' with relatively high K rates throughout his college career. And the hit tool immediately didn't transfer to pro ball with a .180 BA and 31.2/3.7 K%/BB% in 25 games. That isn't just bad, that is atrocious. Completely lost. It's not great that the only question he had coming out of the draft was immediately answered, and not in a good way. This was a 21 year old in the lower minors (High-A). You need a high FYPD college bat to dominate in the majors by like 23 years old, let alone High-A. Jacob Berry and Chase Davis were the last two hyped college bats to have poor pro debuts, and neither of their values are anywhere close to where you wanted them to be. Condon is a better prospect than both of those guys, and I'm not dropping him as far down as those guys at all, but I do believe he does deserve a real drop. This draft class was already really tightly packed at the top with a lot of really, really good college talent, but no one true standout. So based on Condon's poor debut, I don't see how it doesn't make complete sense to drop him under those guys. He has a clear carrying tool in his power, and of course I do factor in that the pro debut was at the end of a long season, draft process, new team, new coach, new everything etc ..., so he's still a Top 10 FYPD pick for me. I still like him as a power bat who will get to hit in Coors (but also gets their developmental team, and it looks like he still needs development). I just wouldn't be able to pull the trigger on him until the other similarly talented college players with better debuts (or who didn't debut yet) were off the board first. I feel like that's reasonable. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 77/31/89/.241/.322/.478/8

73) Braden Montgomery - CHW, OF, 22.0 - Selected 12th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, there was a lot of talk about Montgomery dropping his righty swing to hit exclusively lefty. That doesn't really seem like what you want to hear from a highly drafted college bat, but the lefty swing is so smooth and powerful I get why it doesn't seem like that big of a deal overall. He also had a 20% K% which is substantially higher than the college bats drafted before him. Maybe that is partly why he slipped a bit to 12th overall, and also why Boston was willing to include him in the Crochet trade. The broken ankle which he suffered pre draft on June 8th was also likely a major reason for the drop. So he certainly has some risk with hit tool, platooning and injury, but he also has very major power upside. He's 6'2'', 220 pounds and he smashed 27 homers with a 1.187 OPS in 61 games in the SEC. He's been smashing homers his entire career with 62 homers in 187 games split between the Pac 12 and SEC. He absolutely destroys the baseball with huge exit velocities. That gives him a no doubt carrying tool that will make him a fantasy force. As for the trade, it really doesn't change his value at all. The path to playing time is clearer, but it's an organization downgrade and a future lineup downgrade. It's also a ballpark downgrade. If anything, it makes me like him slightly less, but again, this really shouldn't change his value. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 83/28/91/.252/.333/.480/6

74) Jett Williams - NYM, SS/OF, 21.5 - Jett's season was a straight disaster. He underwent surgery on his right wrist just 11 games into the season and he didn't return until the end of the August. Wrist injuries are known killers for hitters, so it's not surprising to see he wasn't great after returning from the injury either with 0 homers and a .656 OPS in 33 games on the season. I would call it a completely lost year, but if there is one small silver lining to take out of it, it's that he was actually really good in his final 6 games at Triple-A. He had a 192 wRC+ with a 89.6 MPH EV. I know it's just 6 games, but it shows how the 5'6'' Jett can truly pack a punch. He also proved the GB rates (around a 32% GB%) and the plate approach (23.6/14.9 K%/BB%) won't fall apart in the upper minors. Also keep in mind he was just 20 years old this year. Lift, speed, plate approach, and sneaky pop is a potent fantasy combination, and with Williams' injury induced down year, I'm sensing some major buy low opportunities this winter. This is an electric player, size be damned. - 2025 Projection: 16/2/10/.238/.305/.385/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/66/.264/.345/.438/32

75) Jonny Farmelo - SEA, OF, 20.7 - Farmelo was on his way to becoming a legitimate possibility for Top 20 prospect status by this off-season, but he tore his ACL on June 11th after just 46 games. It was a non contact injury while tracking a line drive to centerfield. A lot of the excitement around him was due to his double plus speed and elite athleticism, so a torn knee kinda takes a shot directly to that strength. We've also seen guys tear their knee, and then keep tearing their knee again (or tear their other knee), like Kyle Lewis, Royce Lewis, and Ronald Acuna. On the flip side, we see NFL running backs return from torn ACL's and get their explosion back, so at only 20 years old, I'm expecting Farmelo to retain most of his elite athleticism, but it's certainly not good. And the injury is also expected to keep him out until mid-season 2025. So it could be hard for him to truly get the hype fully rolling again until 2026. Even with all that, I remain high on him because his upside is no joke. He slashed .264/.398/.421 with 4 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.5/16.3 K%/BB% in 46 games at Single-A. He's 6'2'', 205 pounds with a powerful lefty swing and low groundball rates (34.1% GB%). He was thought to be on the raw side coming out of the draft, and while there is still hit tool risk, he showed a good feel to hit with an excellent approach in his debut. Assuming full health, he could be a beast, and even with the injury risk (and also the general risk of being a 19 year old in the lower minors), he should be considered a pretty sought after dynasty prospect. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 86/20/74/.256/.332/.439/30

76) Tommy Edman - LAD, OF, 29.11 - Edman is certainly not a profile I would be looking to age with on my fantasy team, but his value really isn't all that high, so I can't really call him a sell. I see him as a mostly fairly valued hit/speed combo for a win now team. He didn't debut until late August due to a wrist injury that turned into an ankle injury, and you could see the rust in multiple areas with a career worst Barrel% (3.6%), sprint speed (27.9 ft/sec), and whiff% (24%). The surface stats were still solid with 6 homers, 6 steals, and a .237 BA in only 37 games, and with a full off-season to get healthy, I don't see why he wouldn't mostly perform to career norms. Career norms is mid teens homers, upper 20's steals, and a .260 BA. Not bad. He might be a part time player in a couple years, but until that happens, I feel his profile is pretty stable. - 2025 Projection: 77/14/63/.255/.309/.405/25

77) Taylor Ward - LAA, OF, 31.4 - Ward's surface stats feel more underwhelming than they should based on the underlying numbers, but then you see his below average 69.8 MPH swing, and it all comes together. That's not to say that he's not a really good hitter, because he is a really good hitter, but that is to say just don't expect a monster season based on the 13% Barrel%, 90.9 MPH EV, and 17.4 degree launch. In 2024 it resulted in 25 homers with a .246 BA in 156 games, and while the underlying numbers said he got unlucky, I'm not so sure he actually did. - 2025 Projection: 77/24/79/.250/.327/.440/5

78) George Springer - TOR, OF, 35.6 - Springer definitely got unlucky in 2024 with a .298 wOBA vs. a .322 xwOBA, but in order the truly act on that, you would have to ignore two majors reasons to stay away. Which are that his underlying numbers are in a clear 4 year decline, and he's 35 years old. He obviously still has the potential to be put up some solid seasons as the 9.3% Barrel%, 28.1 ft/sec sprint, and 18.7% K% are all well above average, but at his age, you have to factor in the possibility of continued decline, and you also have to lower the best case outcome scenario. He's a decent win now piece, but I wouldn't consider him anything more than that. - 2025 Projection: 78/21/70/.251/.328/.429/14

79) TJ Friedl - CIN, OF, 29.7 - Friedl outperformed his underlying numbers for the 4th year in a row, which isn't surprising because the Statcast blind spot of contact/lift/pull is well known at this point, but he was only barely able to outperform them this year with a .309 wOBA vs. .292 xwOBA. It may be a Statcast blind spot, but it sure feels more precarious of a profile than the guys whose underlying numbers do match the surface stats. He was also majorly banged up all season, so that also could be to blame for the career worst 88 wRC+. He started the year with a wrist injury, he then picked up a broken thumb, and then he tacked on a hamstring injury. His speed tanked almost 2 ft/sec to a well below average 26.5 ft/sec, resulting in only 9 steals, and the BA tanked to .226 which was backed up by the .228 xBA. He still jacked out 13 homers despite a 86 MPH EV, because he has that contact (15.2% K%), lift (16.7 degree launch), pull (48.2% Pull%) profile down pat, but everything else dropped off. With a full off-season to get healthy, and a seemingly pretty good lock on a full time job (he hits both lefties and righties), Friedl could mess around and put up a 20/20 season, or something very close to it. I didn't think I was going to like him when I started this blurb, but I'm kinda liking him right now. And he's not very expensive. - 2025 Projection: 76/18/68/.252/.328/.424/22

80) Brandon Marsh - PHI, OF, 27.4 - Marsh is a platoon bat who you wouldn't want to play against lefties anyway (.552 OPS in 90 PA), and he's never posted a better than 30% K% (32.4% K% in 2024), so it's really hard to call him even the slightest bit of a true target, but he still has a really fun collection skills that I want to bet on. He crushes the ball (10% Barrel% with a 91.6 MPH EV), he's fast (28.2 ft/sec sprint), he has a great plate approach (23.7% Chase% with a 10.5% BB%), and his whiff rates really aren't that bat at all (27.5% whiff%). That's exciting. But I can't ignore that all it added up to was 16 homers, 19 steals, 55 runs and 60 RBI. That just isn't good enough to really go out of your way for. Philly isn't that deep, so Marsh's path to improvement is to get much better lefties, and if he can, the playing time should be there. - 2025 Projection: 66/18/71/.250/.330/.327/20

81) Wilyer Abreu - BOS, OF, 25.9 - Back on August 3rd, 2023, literally mere moments before Abreu went on a crazy run at Triple-A that ended up with him raking in the majors, I got this feeling about him that I just couldn't shake, naming him a target and writing, "there is something I really love about Abreu that I just can’t shake. And that something is probably his sweet, sweet lefty swing." ... and now that we have bat tracking data, I see why I just couldn't shake how much I loved his swing, and it's because not only is it smooth, but it's lightning fast with a near elite 74.6 MPH bat speed. It's no wonder he's kept on raking in the bigs right through 2024 with a 114 wRC+ in 132 games. He uses that swing to absolutely crush the ball with a 50.5% Hard Hit%, 11.1% Barrel%, 91.6 MPH EV,  and a 19.2 degree launch. It only resulted in 15 homers in 132 games, but that is so clearly on the very low end of his true talent, and he racked up 33 doubles. With that swing and batted ball data, there is zero doubt his bat is legit, but there are reasons to remain cautious. For one, he was horrible vs. lefties (.532 OPS in 67 PA), and especially with how deep Boston is, he looks like a strict platoon bat. The other big issue is the hit tool as he had a 28% K% and .229 xBA (.253 BA). The 29.6% whiff% isn't too bad, so I'm not concerned the hit tool is going to tank or anything, but it's clearly below average. He likes to run a bit with 8 steals, which isn't huge, but it's a nice little boost, and he's a really good right fielder, so his glove will certainly help keep him on the field. I would be absolutely all over him if he could hit lefties or if he was in a situation where he would get the leash to get better against them, but I don't see that in Boston. That leaves him as solid dynasty asset (Top 200-250 range), rather than a truly coveted one. 2025 Projection: 69/20/71/.251/.325/.465/9

82) Jesus Sanchez - MIA, OF, 27.5 - Sanchez has absolutely electric bat speed with a 75.2 MPH swing, and it's a short swing with a 7.1 foot length. That swing helps him demolish the ball with a 92.5 MPH EV, but unfortunately, that is just about all he does well. The 7.7 degree launch isn't high enough to take advantage of the hard hit ability, the plate approach is terrible with a 36.1% Chase% and 31.2% whiff%, he has below average speed, and he's terrible vs lefties (.485 OPS). Miami doesn't have many options, so they may play him against lefties anyway, but that's not necessarily a good thing for you. He managed to steal a career high by far 16 bases in 2024, and while that is an outlier he might not be able to keep up, at least it gives him a little added something, because without that, I would like him even less. You know I want to bet on electric bat speed and hard hit ability, but if that is literally all you do, I can't just ignore everything else. - 2025 Projection: 67/22/74/.251/.317/.438/9

83) Jung Hoo Lee - SFG, OF, 26.7 - Lee underwent season ending shoulder surgery for a torn labrum after just 37 games into his MLB career, and while he's expected to be 100% going into 2025, it definitely adds in a healthy dose of risk. And he wasn't fully established yet on the MLB level either with a 83 wRC+. So there is a lot of risk here, and on the flip side, there isn't high upside either. He didn't have a big homer/steal combo in Korea, and he only hit 2 homers with 2 steals before the injury. High risk and low ceiling isn't exactly my favorite combo, ha, but this blurb started off more negative than I intended, because there were plenty of positives from his debut. The elite contact rates fully transferred with a 8.2% K%, he hit the ball hard with an 89.1 MPH EV, and he had plus speed with a 28.4 ft/sec sprint. Good things tend to happen on a baseball field when you have those 3 skills, so I have little doubt that Lee will eventually be a very good MLB hitter. The question is just if it will come in 2025 coming off the surgery, and also how much fantasy upside it will come with. - 2025 Projection: 84/13/58/.278/.337/.392/15

84) Ceddanne Rafaela - BOS, SS/OF, 24.7 - Rafaela put up a 79 wRC+ with a .273 xwOBA (bottom 5% of baseball) in 152 games. Boston has a sea of studs on the way too. I'm starting the blurb out with that moreso as just a reminder to myself to not get too crazy here as much as I want to love Rafaela. He's a whiff and chase machine with a 33% whiff% and 46.4% Chase%. That is really, really bad. His 70.1 MPH bat speed is below average and so is his 86.6 MPH EV. He wasn't great on the bases either, going 19 for 29. Again, I'm saying this as much to myself as I am to you, but there is a very real chance, maybe a good chance, that he is just not a very good hitter. Now having said that, the power/speed combo is super fun for fantasy with an above average 7.5% Barrel%, 14.9 degree launch, and 28.8 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in 15 homers and 19 steals. He also has defensive versality, so even as a super utility player/next man up at several positions type player, that can still equal basically full time at bats over the course of the season. And he has a possibly elite CF glove, so even if they have other players that can play center, they can't play it nearly as well as Rafaela. The bat needs to take a step forward though, and I'm not so sure it's such a sure bet that it's going to happen. It might be a super utility profile on the MLB level when it's all said and done, but he's still young, and that definitely isn't the ceiling. - 2025 Projection: 71/17/74/.244/.295/.402/24

85) Andy Pages - LAD, OF, 24.4 - The Dodgers Giveth and The Dodgers Taketh Away. They giveth us these beautiful, ready made prospects who are perfectly developed and capable of making an immediate impact on our fantasy team ... and then they taketh them right out of the lineup and stick them on their bench, or at Triple-A. We saw it with Michael Busch. We're seeing it now with Andy Pages. And Dalton Rushing is on double deck to get the same treatment, which is why I'm maybe a hair lighter on Rushing than others. But let the record show, I was the first guy hyping Rushing based off his pro debut. You know a good pro debut doesn't slip by me ;). And while we're at it, here is a fun tweet from November 2019 where I name Andy Pages my favorite "No One Else Is On" player. Actually Jordan Rosenblum was the only other one on him (as mentioned in the tweet), and that was back before Jordan was the man behind the man of like every projection based system on the internet, hah. I even identify the prospect writer/analyst sleepers before they hit big! But enough back patting (life is short, let me celebrate my hits, will ya), let's get back to Pages' dynasty value. He set a rock solid foundation to build on in his rookie year with a 10.7% Barrel%, 88.6 MPH EV, 20.8 degree launch, 28.3 ft/sec sprint, 73.1 MPH swing, .321 xwOBA, and a 26.1% whiff% in 116 games. That is a damn good collection of skills, and not very easy to find at all. If he had a full time job, I would be all over him, but it's hard to hype a guy up who simply doesn't have a job. And even if injuries hit, he has competition to be next man up. The cream generally rises to the top, and players generally get their shot one way or another at some point, so for dynasty, I wouldn't be overly concerned about it, but I don't see how you can't factor it in. If you want to ignore playing time, Pages would be a Top 200 dynasty asset easy for me, but with the playing time concerns, I can't rank him quite that high. Close though. - 2025 Projection: 48/15/44/.244/.318/.435/3 Prime Projection: 79/26/82/.252/.333/.465/7

86) Spencer Jones - NYY, OF, 23.11 - Extremely high strikeout rate hitters often straddle that imaginary line between "he'll hit enough for the huge talent to blow up" and "he can't hit, making the huge talent worthless." It often results in a very black or white ranking, because if you think they will hit enough, they get ranked extremely high, and if you don't think they will hit enough, you might erase them completely from your rankings. I like to live in the Grey (not Grey as in Razzball Grey, that would just be odd, but Grey as in the Queen's English of gray), so while I'm obviously less than enthused with Jones' 36.8% K% in 122 games at Double-A, I don't want to just banish him to purgatory. His talent is just too huge to do that at 6'6'', 235 pounds with an at least plus power/speed combo. And even with all of the strikeouts, he still showed out in the upper minors with 17 homers, 25 steals, and a 124 wRC+. He doesn't have to bring the K rate down to like the mid 20's, he can survive in the low 30's. Jones isn't Elly, but we saw the season Elly just put up with a 31.3% K%. The extremely high K rate rate definitely hurts his value (at least he's no Elijah Green and his 44% K%), but I don't think it means you should write him off. The upside is too high, and I don't think the hit tool is hopeless. He's still a Top 75 Prospect for me. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.217/.290/.399/4 Prime Projection: 75/21/79/.238/.317/.436/21

87) Owen Caissie - CHC, OF, 22.9 - Caissie is a super easy evaluation as a low BA, high OBP slugger, but he really doesn't hit as many homers as you would think with 19 homers in 127 games at Triple-A. His 33.4% FB% is on the low side for a slugger, which is what is holding down the homer totals. It's helping his BA, hitting .278, but with a 28.4% K% (which is a career best), he's not going to hit for a high BA in the majors regardless. There could be a scenario where the strikeout rate is hovering around 30% in the majors with a launch that really isn't all that high, which could result is some pretty mediocre numbers. I mainly bring this up because it's the most interesting thing about projecting his future value, but when you pan out for the big picture, he's a powerful and athletic 6'3'', 190 pounds with current plus power and possibly more coming down the line. He'll also chip in with steals, nabbing 11 bags. And add two stars in OBP leagues with a 12.9% BB%. I don't want to lose the forest through the trees by slicing and dicing the numbers too much, so I'm still projecting his as a low BA, high OBP slugger no matter how you slice it. There is a short term logjam for playing time, but long term I don't see many roadblocks. 2025 Projection: 19/6/25/.227/.303/.420/2 Prime Projection: 78/28/91/.246/.335/.480/7

88) Luke Keaschall - MIN, 2B/OF, 22.8 - Keaschall's season ended on August 8th with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery, but we all know by now that you don't need elbows to hit. Ohtani just went 54/59 while rehabbing from internal brace or whatever super secret surgery he underwent. Keaschall ain't Ohtani, but point being, I don't think the surgery should ding his value too much. And his value was starting to get pretty exciting with him proving the profile will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .281/.393/.439 with 8 homers, 9 steals, and a 19.1/12.0 K%/BB% in 58 games at Double-A. He doesn't have huge raw power, but he hits the ball fairly hard, and can definitely lift and pull it with a 35.3% GB% and 50.3% Pull%. He's got speed, he gets the bat on the ball, and he has a good approach. It's possible the good but not great tools will play down a bit on the major league level, and he's also not a particularly good defensive player, so he's going to have to hit. But a lift, speed, contact, approach profile is a lot of boxes to check, and the profile is fantasy friendly. - 2025 Projection: 18/4/12/.247/.304/.399/5 Prime Projection: 82/19/72/.266/.334/.436/19

89) Colby Thomas - OAK, OF, 24.2 - Colby Thomas comes to the plate with one thing in mind and one thing only ... well, maybe two things ... and those things are lifting it and pulling it. He has a relatively open batting stance that telegraphs his intentions, and he executes his plan with a 33% GB% and 54.5% Pull% at Triple-A which led to 17 homers in 73 games (31 homers in 132 games on the season). He's not necessarily a raw power beast at 5'10'', but he's pretty thick and he definitely has more than enough power to make his profile work. He's also a good athlete who stole 15 bases this season and 25 bags in 2023, which gives him that added upside bump to make him a very enticing proximity stash headed into 2025. The thing that can tank him is that the hit tool is very shaky with a 30.3/7.3 K%/BB% at Triple-A, and there is something about the batting stance which feels like it could get a bit exposed in the majors. The profile is actually very similar to Connor Norby, except Thomas has more raw power and runs more, while I trust Norby's hit tool more. Don't overextend yourself here, but he's definitely someone to put a star next to their name if you want to take an upside shot on someone who could very well break camp with the club. - 2025 Projection: 48/13/46/.229/.294/.420/10 Prime Projection: 75/23/78/.252/.318/.452/15

90) Denzel Clarke - OAK, OF, 24.11 - Back in 2023, I literally had Lawrence Butler and Denzel Clarke ranked back to back in my 2023 Top 1,000 Dynasty Baseball Rankings and #744 and #745. They both had extremely similar profiles. They are the same age, they are almost the same size, they are both excellent athletes with plus power/speed combos, they are both Oakland prospects, they are both outfielders, and they both had major swing and miss problems with strikeout rates north of 30% at High-A. But that is where their paths started to split, as Butler made extreme improvements to his strikeout rate, putting up a sub 20% K% in the upper minors in 2023 and 2024 (and obviously holding enough of those gains in the majors), while Clarke's strikeout rate remained in the 30%+ area ... that is until the 2nd half of this season. From June 12th on, Clarke slashed .317/.387/.524 with 9 homers, 30 steals and a 23.5/8.6 K%/BB% in 73 games at Double-A. Granted, he did it two years after Butler, so age to level isn't as impressive, and he also had to lower his launch to do it with a 50.5% GB%, but that is still a major improvement to see, because like Butler, he has the type of power/speed combo to make a major fantasy impact. Even with the lower launch, he has the power and speed to make that type of profile work. I've been heavily debating Colby Thomas vs. Clarke, and while I gave the nod to Thomas because I trust his hit tool and launch more, I think Clarke has the upside nod. He's a definite target this off-season. - 2025 Projection: 28/7/32/.220/.289/.397/9 Prime Projection: 76/20/74/.244/.318/.430/25

91) Nick Castellanos - PHI, OF, 33.1 - Castellanos basically has the recipe for a guy you don't want to buy the decline years on. He chases a ton with a 37.8% Chase% and he whiffs a ton with a 30.1% whiff%. We've actually already seen the decline once he hit 30 years old, putting up a 95, 109, and 105 wRC+ over the last 3 years. He was a 120+ guy in his prime more or less. And his bat speed is only slightly above average at 71.9 MPH, so you can't even fall back on electric bat speed. Following a normal decline curve, it seems to me he can level down yet again in his age 33+ seasons, and considering he's a terrible defensive player, he's just not a guy I'm looking to own in his mid 30's. Having said that, the skills haven't fallen off a cliff yet with a .333 xOBA, so I do think he can be a solid hitter in 2025. - 2025 Projection: 76/24/83/.258/.311/.448/6

92) Brendan Donovan - STL, 2B/OF, 28.3 - All the hubbub over Donovan's 2023 Spring Training power surge turned out to be real (I thought it was real at the time as well), but 14 homers in 153 games is still lackluster, especially when it comes with only 5 steals. The plate skills are elite with a 12.4/7.2 K%/BB%, and it's led to a career 119 wRC+, but a 123 overall finish on the Razzball Player Rater in 2024 shows it's not a fantasy friendly profile. He's pretty close to an empty BA play, which are not my types of players. I want to like Donovan more than I actually do. - 2025 Projection: 76/16/68/.280/.352/.419/6

93) Lars Nootbaar - STL, OF, 27.5 - Nootbaar stole only 7 bags in 10 attempts in 109 games, which just isn't enough for his type of profile, because he also doesn't hit for a high average (.244 BA in 2024 and .246 in his career), or hit enough homers (12 homers in 2024). He hits the ball very hard with a 91.8 MPH EV, but his launch has actually gone in the wrong direction, declining every year of his career with a 6 degree launch in 2024. His speed has also declined every single year of his career, bottoming out to a below average 27 ft/sec. Maybe you can blame injuries for that, but he's never played in more than 117 games, so not sure injuries would be a point in his favor. Plate approach of course is his best asset with a 19.5/12.8 K%/BB%, so add two stars in an OBP league, but in a 5x5 BA league, it seems his ceiling is just solid. - 2025 Projection: 74/15/71/.260/.352/.425/11

94) Joc Pederson - TEX, OF, 32.11 - Pederson has been the best platoon bat in baseball over the last 3 years, putting up xwOBA's in the top 5-10% of baseball in each year. It resulted in a career best 151 wRC+ in 449 PA in 2024. The lack of PA seriously cuts down his upside in fantasy though as he only had 62 Runs and 64 RBI. He's hard to roster in weekly lineup leagues, and while he's obviously valuable in daily lineup leagues, even in many of those leagues it's not that comfortable rostering a platoon bat. He's also basically 33 years old already. You feel the pull to rank a guy higher who just put up a .902 OPS with beastly underlying numbers, but the lack of PA and age prevent me from getting too crazy. - 2025 Projection: 66/25/71/.257/.345/.470/5

95) Giancarlo Stanton - NYY, OF, 35.4 - Stanton is the Bat Speed King, absolutely lapping the field with a 81.3 MPH swing. Oneil Cruz is 2nd at 78.6 MPH. On the flip side, it's also the longest swing in baseball with a very worst 8.6 degree length (Javier Baez is tied for last with him). And both of those were with a 1 swing qualification, so there is no sample size funny business going on there. The dude swings hard (the hardest), and he swings long (the longest). And while we didn't need anymore evidence to know exactly who Giancarlo Stanton was (a low BA slugger, or should I say, THE low BA slugger), we now have that clear evidence. He also gets hurt all the time and likely won't play in much more than 120 games at best. You know what you are getting. He's a fairly priced win now piece. 2025 Projection: 61/29/81/.230/.304/.470/0

96) Jurickson Profar - ATL, OF, 33.1 - By golly, it took 14 years, but Profar finally had that superstar breakout we all thought was possible back when he was an elite prospect (and #1 overall like everywhere in 2013). If you took him in your 2010 First Year Player Draft, you must be pretty damn happy right now. It finally paid off ;). He had that classic year 32 power breakout with a career high by a mile 91.1 MPH EV (87.3 MPH was his previous career high). Just how we drew it up. The plus contact and plus approach didn't take a step back at all either, so it was a full on blow up season, and he kept it up all year with 24 homers, 10 steals, 94 Runs, 84 RBI and a .280/.380 BA/OBP. The 139 wRC+ was elite. I'm not in the business of paying up for career years at 32 years old, so there is just no way I can see myself paying up for Profar, but it's not like anything he did was lucky. He just got magically INSANELY stronger 12 years into his career. And he did it during an off-season where he was a free agent and nobody really wanted him. His career was almost over. He had nothing to lose. Totally normal. - 2025 Projection: 82/18/69/.266/.339/.430/8

97) Cedric Mullins - BAL, OF, 30.6 - Mullins is terrible vs lefties (.506 OPS in 101 PA), and he's only an average CF at best, so he's basically in a pretty strict platoon role at this point. And with a speed first profile entering his 30's, this is a train you want to jump off of. He was limited to just 499 PA in 147 games in 2024, and it resulted in only 69 runs and 54 RBI. The fun power/speed combo is still there with 18 homers (21.5 degree launch), and 32 steals (28.2 ft/sec sprint), but the launch is so extreme, it kills his BA too (.234 BA). He really seems like he's entering the part time player part of his career, and while he can maybe stave that off for another season, it's not going to be for much longer. - 2025 Projection: 67/16/61/.240/.310/.408/28

98) Pavin Smith - ARI, 1B/OF, 29.2 - Even with Arizona trading for Naylor, Arizona still has openings at DH and in the OF, and with the year Smith just had in 2024, I'm betting on him winning a job. He was a straight beast in 60 MLB games with a 142 wRC+, 14.7% Barrel%, 13.1 degree launch, 90.2/96.2 MPH AVG/FB EV, and a 19.6/11.4 K%/BB%. It resulted in an elite .395 xwOBA. He always had an excellent plate approach, but we were waiting on the game power to tick up, and boy did it tick up this year. He looks like a great candidate for a late career breakout, and is a no doubt target. - 2025 Projection: 76/24/82/.268/.342/.457/2

99) Jhonkensy Noel - CLE, OF, 23.8 - If you've been loving diving into the new bat speed data like I have, the first thing that smacks you right in the face is how elite Noel's bat speed is. Only Giancarlo Stanton and Oneil Cruz top his 78.1 MPH bat, and it's not a particularly long swing either. It's not short, but it's not in the territory to be concerned. And at 6'3'', 250 pounds, with that fast of a swing, bad things happen when he makes contact, smashing 13 homers with a 14.5% Barrel% and 19.3 degree launch in 67 MLB games. The flip side of swinging that hard and fast, is that it comes with a lot of missing the ball too with a 34.2% whiff% and 31.8% K%. He also seems to mostly close his eyes and just swing at anything with a 45% Chase%. He's bad on defense, and while he was good vs righties in the minors, he didn't hit them well in the majors (.683 OPS). He's big and he swings hard and that is about it, but we know that is all you need to make a big fantasy impact if your bat is in the lineup everyday. That last part isn't guaranteed though with Cleveland being pretty deep in corner/DH power bats. Why play Noel against a righty when you can play Kyle Manzardo? Or Will Brennan? or Chase DeLauter? Or George Valera? I wouldn't be overly concerned about it because if he mashes he will give them no choice, but he wasn't playing everyday down the stretch, and you have to at least have playing time problems in the back of your mind. - 2025 Projection: 71/27/83/.238/.311/.482/2

100) Ryan Clifford - NYM, 1B/OF, 21.8 - After hitting only 1 homer in 31 games in New York's tough High-A ballpark (although he didn't hit any homers on the road either), Clifford got the call to Double-A as a still 20 year old and lived up to his big power profile. He jacked out 18 homers with a 133 wRC+ and 28.9/15.6 K%/BB% in 98 games. Even at High-A he put up a 124 wRC+, which is the sign of a good player who can still produce when the homers aren't coming (or it's a sign that High-A pitchers just didn't want to pitch to him with a 23.5% BB%). Clifford was one of my favorite targets in his first year player draft class because he looked like a sure bet to become an exciting power hitting prospect, and that is exactly what he's become. The strikeouts are too high to really put him into that elite tier, but I wouldn't rule out him improving there at a still young 21 years old. Even if he can't, the power will play on any level. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/31/90/.239/.324/.491/4

101) Zac Veen - COL, OF, 23.4 - Long gone are the days where Veen is a major prospect target for me. The book is far from written on him, but I think it's more than fair to say he is one of my biggest misses in terms of ranking him as a near elite prospect a couple years ago. The development simply hasn't happened like I thought it could, and him being a Rockies prospect, yea, maybe I should have seen that coming. But just because he hasn't blown up, doesn't mean he's still not a pretty enticing fantasy prospect. As I expected, he bounced back from an injury induced down year in 2023, slashing .259/.346/.459 with 11 homers, 21 steals in 25 attempts, and a 24.8/11.1 K%/BB% in 65 games at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. We saw a power uptick that we were waiting for, but it was more of a moderate power uptick than a true explosion. And once again, his year was marred by injuries with a back and thumb injury, which once again sapped some power when he returned. I don't know whether to think the constant injuries are hiding that upside that made me fall in love originally, or if he's simply injury prone and it's something that should be a demerit on his profile. Maybe a little of both. What makes him so exciting for fantasy is his speed and base running ability, which are at least plus, and he also has a good glove in the OF, which could get him on the field. The strikeout rates are elevated and the power looks like it might only end up average at best, so while I still see so much upside at a still projectable 6'3'', 190 pounds, I can't rank him any higher than this. 2025 Projection: 29/6/26/.229/.292/.371/11 Prime Projection: 78/18/68/.248/.319/.418/25

102) Dylan Beavers - BAL, OF, 23.7 - Beavers doesn't have a clear path to a full time job right now, but beyond their starting lineup, and pending what they do this off-season, they really aren't that deep organizationally long term. Even short term there are bench jobs available for Beavers to force his way into the lineup at some point during 2025, and we all know injuries happen. He can play all 3 OF spots and is a pretty good defensive player. There is a reason Baltimore didn't use him as trade bait (yet). I think they like him a lot. There is going to be opportunity eventually, and he has the type of fantasy friendly skillset to go after. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 206 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that hits the ball hard and hits the ball in the air (15 homers with a 49.1% FB% in 119 games at Double-A). He's also fast with 31 steals. The hit tool isn't great with a .241 BA and 22.6/13.2 K%/BB%, but the high walk rates mitigate some of that, and he has the type of power/speed combo to survive a low BA. Beavers looks like a very enticing, not hyped to death fantasy target right now. He's a Top 100 prospect for me at the least, and just might crack my Top 75. - 2025 Projection: 17/5/21/.228/.297/.391/5 Prime Projection: 81/20/75/.247/.326/.430/24

103) Brandon Winokur - MIN, SS/OF, 20.5 - Winokur is one of my favorite prospect targets right now relative to perceived value. 6'6'', 210 pound athletes like this don't grow on trees, and I think he deserves to rise to true unicorn status. His big time power is obvious, and it resulted in 14 homers with a 89.6 MPH EV in 94 games at Single-A. The area of his game that gets considerably underrated, is how good of an athlete he is. He put up plus run times in high school, and then he went out and stole 23 bags in 29 attempts this year. He played both SS and CF this year. This is not some lumbering corner bat. This is a unicorn with real defensive value. The problem, of course, is the hit tool. He put up a 28.0/8.3 K%/BB% and he swings and misses a lot. There is no denying there is very real risk here, but that is why he isn't like a Top 50 prospect. As is, I believe he is a top 100 fantasy prospect, and he won't be valued anywhere close to that in off-season prospect drafts. He's a major target. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/26/83/.246/.317/.471/15

104) Aidan Smith - TBR, OF, 20.8 - The Rays targeted Smith in the Randy Arozarena trade (along with Brody Hopkins, ranked 10th below), which is good news for Smith, because he goes from a ballpark that is terrible for his profile, to one that is perfect for him. Isaac Paredes proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the righty lift and pull profile can thrive in Tampa, and that is Smith's game with a 35.7% GB% and 54.4% Pull% (11 homers in 97 games at Single-A). He combines that with projectable power at 6'2'', 190 pounds, plus speed with 41 steals in 47 attempts, and a strong plate approach with a 23.2/14.4 K%/BB%. The hit tool is still on the risky side, but if he gains meaningful raw power as he enters his 20's, he has true explosion potential. He's really exciting. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/76/.250/.338/.443/25

105) Robert Calaz - COL, OF, 19.5 - The 6'2'', 202 pound Calaz is a straight power hitting beast. He cracked 7 homers in 43 games in the DSL in 2023, he smoked 10 homers in 49 games in stateside rookie in 2024, and then he chipped in 2 homers in 13 games at Single-A to close out the season. He crushes the ball with plus to double plus raw power, and his batted ball profile is conducive to both power and average. He slashed .327/.386/.571 at Single-A as an 18 year old, and has a career .336/.436/.603 triple-slash in 105 career games. He's done nothing but obliterate every level of pro ball that's been put in front of him. He doesn't exactly have my favorite batting stance, but the swing is quick and powerful, and I'm not going to get too caught up in that. The biggest risk is the contact rates, as the strikeout rate has been high at every level (career 23.4% K%, which is quite high for rookie ball levels), culminating with a 28.1% K% at Single-A. We have to trust Colorado to develop him, which isn't great, and then we have to trust Colorado to actually play him and give him leash, which also isn't great. Combined with the hit tool risk, it prevents me from going higher than this, but he has one of the top 19 year old power bats in the minors. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/28/88/.247/.324/.471/7

106) Eduardo Quintero - LAD, OF, 19.7 - Quintero was one of, if not the top DSL breakout in 2023, and he mostly backed it up in stateside rookie ball in 2024, slashing .330/.459/.449 with 3 homers, 29 steals, and a 19.3/17.6 K%/BB% in 56 games. It was good for a 142 wRC+. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 77 wRC+ in 27 games, but it came with a 19.6/16.1 K%/BB%, so it's not like he was completely overmatched or anything. You have to give these kids time to adjust to a new level. He's an excellent athlete at 6'0'', 175 pounds with plus speed, hard hit ability, a good feel to hit, and a plus plate approach. The launch is geared for both power and average, and he has a good glove in the OF. This guy basically does everything well on a baseball field, and while there is still plenty of development left to go (being more aggressive at the dish, getting stronger, unlocking more game power, proving it at higher levels), you have to trust the Dodgers to get the most out of him. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 86/19/74/.273/.341/.430/26

107) Braylon Payne - MIL, OF, 18.8 - When a smart franchise sticks their neck out and selects a high school bat higher than expected, you should take notice. I took notice when it happened with Xavier Isaac and Tampa, and then Ralphy Velazquez with Cleveland. I ranked both very high and named them targets. And now I'm going to do the same with Payne after the Brewers selected him 17th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft. The book on the 6'2'', 186 pound Payne coming into the draft was that he had big time talent and upside, but was still on the raw side. Which is why it was so exciting to see his electric pro debut where he slashed .438/.526/.625 with 0 homers, 4 steals, and a 15.8/15.8 K%/BB% in 4 games at Single-A. It's only 4 games, and the swing isn't geared towards power right now, but there is definitely raw power in there with a 110 MPH shot already to his name, and he has game breaking speed. He's also young for the class and will be 18 years old for most of 2025. Payne is the type of target you stick your neck out for in off-season prospect drafts. He already ranked 20th overall on my Top 56 2025 First Year Player Draft Rankings (Patreon), and I might just mess around and place him in my Top 15 when I release the full Top 100+ FYPD Rankings this off-season. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 89/18/63/.267/.334/.436/38

108) Alec Burleson - STL, OF, 26.4 - The Cards are committed to letting the kids play in 2025, so I wouldn't say I'm overly concerned with Burleson's playing time, but he actually has a lot going against him. He's a terrible defensive player, he's terrible vs lefties (.514 OPS in 142 PA), he's slow as dirt with a 25.5 ft/sec sprint and he's a 27 year old with a career .307 OBP and 97 wRC+ in 275 games. Even in his breakout 2024, he still only had a 106 wRC+, which combined with the poor defense and baserunning resulted in a 0.6 WAR. It hurts me to say it, but he's really not a starter. Having said that, the 12.8% K% is elite and he hits the ball hard with a 89.7 MPH EV. With the Cards in rebuild/bridge year mode, he should at least have a strong side of a platoon role, and there is no guarantee he gets fully relegated to that role either. Long term though, he looks like a good but not great platoon bat, which isn't extremely valuable in fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 68/20/77/.270/.318/.424/6

109) JJ Bleday - OAK, OF, 27.5 - Bleday is a low ceiling player with little speed, a below average BA, and above average homer power at best. I also think there is risk too, because he's a below average outfielder, and Denzel Clark and Colby Thomas are charging hard to compete for those open OF jobs. Kurtz and Soderstrom could push Rooker into more OF duty too. I see the appeal with a 19.5/10.4 K%/BB%, an 88.5 MPH EV, and a 18.6 degree launch, but I just don't really see an impact player here. He's not a starter on a good team, and while Oakland isn't good yet, they are kinda getting there. He's actually getting valued pretty highly, so if you can sell high here, I would go for it. The upside just isn't high enough to make you regret it too much even in a worst case scenario. 2025 Projection: 74/19/69/.245/.328/.420/4

110) Lourdes Gurriel Jr. - ARI, OF, 31.6 - Gurriel is just about the poster child for high floor, low upside vet bat. He gets the bat on the ball with an 18.3% K%, he'll pop 20-ish dingers with a solid Barrel%, and he'll even steal a handful of bags. Nothing flashy. Nothing league winning. Just rock solid. The deeper the league, the more value a guy like this has. - 2025 Projection: 69/20/79/.267/.312/.435/5

111) Jhostynxon Garcia - BOS, OF, 22.3 - Garcia is one of my top prospect targets relative to perceived value, and he was one of several prospect targets I named in my End of Season Mailbag Podcast (Patreon). He has legit thunder in his bat with a quick and powerful righty swing that resulted in 23 homers in 107 games. He hits the ball really hard and he lifts it with all fields power. He's also a good athlete who can play CF, and he'll run a bit too with 17 steals. He started the year at Single-A and flew all the way through to Double-A by mid August. He wasn't quite as good at Double-A as he was in the lower minors, but he still put up an above average 103 wRC+, and the most important thing is that his K rate didn't skyrocket with a 19% K%. The hit tool and plate approach are certainly the biggest risk here with a 21.6/7.2 K%/BB% overall, but the K rate actually got better at each higher level, and he walked a ton in 2021-23, so he has that skill in there. His combination of power, athleticism and good OF defense is very enticing, and the hit tool was actually pretty decent this year. Boston is crowded, so he doesn't have a path to playing time, but trades happen and injuries/ineffectiveness happens too, so he'll get his shot eventually, and when he does, we could be looking at a guy who puts up big EV's with a high launch, above average sprint, positive defense value, and good enough K rates. He can be a legit impact fantasy bat going for a price way under that right now. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/25/84/.247/.321/.458/12

112) Slade Caldwell - ARI, OF, 18.9 - Selected 29th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, of course it was the Diamondbacks to jump on the 5'6'' Caldwell at the end of the first round. They were also the team to jump on the undersized Corbin Carroll when he fell in his draft year. Little guys falling in the draft is a tale as old as time, and Arizona recognizes a good thing in a small package when they see one. Caldwell is basically the exact replica of Jett Williams from the 2022 draft, except he's a lefty. He may be short, but he is not weak with a very built up frame and the ability to hit the ball pretty damn hard. He unleashes some explosive lefty swings, but as you can tell from the comps, what you are buying is the elite hit/speed combo. The plate approach is top of the class, he makes tons of contact, and the speed is double plus. He's also super young for the class. Buy the little man discount. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 89/14/68/.284/.355/.423/30

113) Ryan Waldschmidt - ARI, OF, 22.6 - Selected 31st overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Waldschmidt is a rock solid 6'2'', 205 pounds with a howitzer of a righty upper cut swing. He hits the ball hard, he's a good athlete who loves to run, and he has a strong plate approach. He slashed .333/.469/.610 with 14 homers, 25 steals, and a 16.5%/15.0% K%/BB% in 59 games in the SEC. It's probably more of a solid across the board profile rather than a truly standout one on the MLB level, but he's yet another really enticing college bat in a class full of really enticing college bats. And his strong pro debut made me like him even more with a 142 wRC+, 4 steals, and 13.6/22.7 K%/BB% in 14 games at Single-A. It's a good sign that the solid across the board profile will play, and while it came with 0 homers, the 36.1% GB% and 51.4% Pull% shows the power should be fine. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 80/18/76/.265/.339/.438/19

114) Carson Benge - NYM, OF, 22.2 - Selected 19th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the 6'1'', 181 pound Benge is lean, loose and mean at the dish with a quick and athletic lefty swing that most certainly looks the part. He slashed .335/.444/.665 with 18 homers, 10 steals, and a 16.8%/16.1% K%/BB% in 61 games in the Big 12. He then stepped right into pro ball and impressed with 2 homers, 3 steals, a 20.3/15.9 K%/BB% and a 152 wRC+ in 15 games at Single-A. It came with a solid 88.3 MPH EV and a 51.2 GB%, so a bit of a mixed bag there. He's the type that does everything well on a baseball field with bouncy athleticism, bat speed, power, mature plate approach, and he even pitches too. He profiles as an average to above average across the board player with the upside to beat that projection. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/20/77/.267/.334/.440/16

115) Druw Jones - ARI, OF, 21.4 - Jones got his career back on track after a disastrous pro debut in 2023, but it still wasn't a particularly impressive year considering what we expected out of him after getting drafted 2nd overall. He went back to Single-A and slashed .275/.409/.405 with 6 homers, 21 steals, and a 28.0/18.0 K%/BB% in 109 games. It was good for a 125 wRC+. The strikeout rate is way to high for a 20 year old at Single-A, and so is the 57.2% GB%. Even with a .409 OBP, he still only stole 21 bags in 26 attempts, and with speed now looking like the main selling point here, that really isn't that impressive. All of the raw tools and bloodlines that got him drafted so highly are still there at a projectable 6'4'', 180 pounds with a plus raw power/speed combo, but he still looks so raw out there. He needs to refine his game in every aspect (other than defense, where he is a plus CF, which will help get him on the field for sure). Right now he looks on track to be more of a mid 20's breakout candidate, which isn't what you want when you draft a high schooler 2nd overall, but that is where we are at. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/17/67/.247/.320/.429/22

116) Griffin Burkholder - PHI, OF, 19.7 - Selected 63rd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Burkholder is a strong and physical 6'2'', 195 pounds with double plus speed, potentially plus power, and a good feel to hit. He's definitely the type of explosive athlete to jump off the screen with electric bat speed, and that explosiveness shined through in just one single game in his pro debut. He went 1 for 2 with a triple, and tell me you don't get exited just watching that. He still needs to learn to tap into his raw power and there are still questions on just how good the hit tool will be, but this is a very enticing high school bat with legit upside. He's a definite target. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 84/20/76/.257/.328/.443/28

117) Victor Robles - SEA, OF, 27.10 - I definitely noticed Robles leveled up a bit in 2023, ranking him a pretty decently 543rd overall last off-season considering his career up until that point, and in 2024, Robles proved that leveling up was for real. He had the best season of his career by 75 country miles, slashing .307/.381/.433 with 4 homers, 34 steals, and a 18.0/7.1 K%/BB% in 91 games. If someone would have told me back in 2017 that Robles would have a 141 wRC+ in his age 27 year old season, I would have clearly assumed that he fulfilled his elite prospect destiny. But we all know that wasn't the path at all, and the problem is that you can't really trust that 141 wRC+ at all either. A .370 BABIP was doing a lot of the heavy lifting for that high BA (.257 xBA), and while bumping up his EV about 2 MPH is a big reason for the breakout, a 86.7 MPH EV is still well below average. He's going to play corner outfield (he's a below average CF), he doesn't get on base a ton, and his speed has actually been declining with a career worst 27.8 ft/sec sprint. He's basically a steals only player who should probably be a 4th outfielder. He has a starting job right now and he clearly has the ability to make a big impact in steals, so I see the appeal, but I'm only in here at a super, super cheap price. He's going 192nd overall in NFBC over the last month, which I find kinda crazy. - 2025 Projection: 74/9/48/.262/.333/.382/30

118) Sal Frelick - MIL, OF, 24.11 - I honestly thought Frelick would be able to get to more power when I was evaluating him in his draft year, but his power has been true very bottom of the scale with a 83.4 MPH EV and 2 homers in 145 games. This type of profile can work with like a 86+ MPH EV, but an 83+ MPH EV is absolutely brutal. The contact is elite with a 14.9% K% and he has double plus speed with a 29.3 ft/sec sprint, but the extreme lack of power is killing him. It resulted in a .259 BA and 86 wRC+. He also doesn't run as much as you would want this profile to with 18 steals. He's entering his mid 20's, so I do think he can bring that EV up 2+ MPH at peak, and he's a good defensive outfielder, so his glove should keep him on the field. He's got a classic hit/speed/defense profile, but his power needs to level up to keep a starting job in the long run. - 2025 Projection: 73/7/44/.266/.329/.361/20

119) Jake McCarthy - ARI, OF, 27.8 - McCarthy has improved his strikeout rate every year of his career, and it reached a career best 15.8% in 2024. That improvement puts him on the radar as a possible true everyday guy who will hit for contact and rack up steals, but unfortunately, he has competition for that job, and I'm not so sure I want to bet on him winning it. Alek Thomas is right behind him, and Thomas has equally as good contact rates and he hits the ball much harder. McCarthy sacrificed power to get those contact gains with a career worst 84.5 MPH EV. There are also other alignments Arizona could use that would push McCarthy out. I would like him more if I was sure had a lock on the job, because the speed is elite with a 29.8 ft/sec sprint and 25 steals in 495 PA, but with the lack of job security, and lack of hard hit, I can only put him so high. - 2025 Projection: 68/9/57/.265/.331/.392/29

120) Willi Castro - MIN, OF/3B/2B/SS, 27.11 - Castro is a super utility player who was an overall positive on defense (+3.9 Fangraphs value), he hits at the top of the order, scoring 89 runs, and he amassed a ton of at bats with 635 PA. The nature of his everyday role feels a bit precarious long term, but short term it does seem likely he will get a ton of at bats again. He wasn't able to maintain his outlier steal season in 2023 (33 steals), coming back down to earth with 14 in 23 attempts, and he doesn't hit for much power (12 homers with a 87.4 MPH EV) or hit for a high BA (.247 BA with a 23.6% K%). He's optimally getting more like 400-500 PA per season, and not 600+, but right now, it does seem like his path to 600+ is still there. I'm not too intrigued by him in dynasty except in medium to deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 77/13/58/.250/.330/.397/17

121) Matt Vierling - DET, 3B/OF, 28.6 - Vierling seems to have a near everyday job in Detroit, but he's a low end option, and his hold on that full time job is very precarious long term, and probably short term too. H has a career 100 wRC+ in 429 games which is dead average, and he has a career .318 xwOBA, which is also almost dead average. His 21.3/7.2 K%/BB% is about average, and his 16 homers with 6 steals is about average (maybe being generous there). But you get the point, he's very MLB average, which is very fantasy below average. He hits the ball hard with a 89.8 MPH EV and he's very fast with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint, but he has a long enough track record, even going back to the minors, to not expect a big homer/steal breakout. 2025 Projection: 72/15/61/.262/.321/.402/8

122) Miguel Vargas - CHW, 3B/OF, 25.4 - Vargas' dynasty owners finally got what they wished for when Vargas got traded to Chicago, opening up playing time, but they say be careful what you wish for, because he was atrocious. He put up a 16 wRC+ in 42 games. He hit .104 with .170 SLG. That has got to be close to all time bad in 42 games. His underlying numbers are admittedly still interesting enough with a 21.6% whiff%, 21.8% Chase%, 28.6 ft/sec sprint, and 21.3 degree launch, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough (86.2 MPH EV), and he swings a slow bat (69.8 MPH). He's also not going to contribute much in Runs or RBI even if he does put together a decent season. He's fine as a bottom of the roster type, or as a depth piece in a deeper league, but I'm no longer really eyeing him as an interesting flier type. - 2025 Projection: 46/10/39/.219/.299/.368/7

123) Tre’ Morgan - TBR, 1B/OF, 22.9 - The only stop of Morgan's career where he had less than a .316 BA was when he got to Double-A in late August. He put up a .211 BA in 21 games. His K% also jumped up to 18.7% from 7.8% at High-A. There isn't high upside here with a moderate power/speed combo at best, so seeing him immediately struggle harder than he ever has the first time he faced advanced competition isn't great. Don't get me wrong, I still think he can be a solid MLB bat, but if the hit tool is only good and not great, I just don't see how he can be a true impact fantasy player. He also struggled hard vs lefties (.521 OPS), so especially with Tampa, it looks likely he will be in a platoon role. This blurb ended up being much more negative than even I expected, because at the end of the day, I do believe this guy is going to hit at any level. I'm just worried about the upside. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/14/66/.280/.336/.422/13

124) Luis Baez - HOU, OF, 21.2 - Please just watch how fast this home run left Baez' bat. Is that even real? That looked like a cartoon or something. And while you're at it, also check out how athletic that swing was. For such a powerful man, that is a damn athletic swing. It's no surprise he demolished 20 homers in 92 games at High-A (and he also stole 9 bags, showing off that athleticism I was talking about). His power is no joke, and he lifts and pulls it. The problem is that the hit tool and plate approach are both double below average with a 27.3/5.4 K%/BB%. He got a cup of coffee at Double-A to end the season, and it was nice to see the 18.0/13.1 K%/BB% in 14 games, but it came with only 1 homer and a 84 wRC+. He can play some OF, so he's not a defensive liability, but he's not likely to add much value with the glove. The bat is going to have to hit it's ceiling, and he still has to prove it in the upper minors, but it's so easy to fall in love with that swing and power. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 72/27/84/.245/.316/.463/5

125) Tai Peete - SEA, SS/OF/3B, 19.7 - Tai Peete is the same age as many of the high schoolers in the 2024 Draft (he's 1 month younger than Bryce Rainer), and his pure talent can rival any of them (maybe not Konnor Griffin's, but everyone else's). He also already has a pretty strong season at Single-A under his belt with a .269/.343/.408 triple-slash in 115 games. That is a pretty good slash for an 18 year old in full season ball. He hit only 7 homers, but all 7 of them came in his final 59 games, which is the improvement you want to see from a young player as the season goes along. And he has no joke raw power at 6'2'', 193 pounds, so there is a lot more of that coming. He's a really good athlete and he displayed elite base stealing ability with 45 steals in 50 attempts. What I'm trying to say, is that Peete is getting mighty underrated right now. I understand why he's getting rated so low, because the hit tool is a legit problem with a 30.7% K%, but he walked 10.4% of the time too, and you have to take into account his young age for the level. There is definitely still a lot of rawness to his game, but he performed pretty well despite that rawness, so imagine what he can do as he starts to refine his game. I aim for upside in fantasy, and Peete is all upside. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/75/.247/.323/.432/26

126) Enrique Bradfield - BAL, OF, 23.4 - I talked about it in the Strategy Section of the Tampa Bay Rays Team Report, but Enrique Bradfield's profile just isn't one I go out of my way to roster. It's an extreme steals, extremely low power profile that just doesn't fit in with how I build my teams, but if this is a profile you like, Bradfield is a good one to go after. He proved everything will transfer to Double-A in the last 27 games of the season, slashing .287/.395/.396 with 1 homer, 15 steals, and a 11.7/12.5 K%/BB%. He's a good CF, the contact rates are excellent (although they weren't as good at High-A with a 16.6% K% in 81 games), he gets on base, and he's a demon on the bases. He's a CF version of Xavier Edwards, and with Cedric Mullins hitting free agency after this year, it wouldn't be crazy at all to see Bradfield winning the CF job in 2026 and beyond. - 2025 Projection: 19/0/7/.248/.298/.334/8 Prime Projection: 77/6/44/.278/.336/.369/43

127) Chandler Simpson - TBR, OF, 24.5 - Simpson's profile is as extreme as it gets with 1 homer, 104 steals, and a 8.5% K% in 110 games at mostly Double-A. It's a little too extreme for my taste, but he's also a good CF, so if he gets his bat in the lineup, he will be a fantasy difference maker in the steals category. These type of steals only types have never been the type of player I like going after. It creates too much of a hole in the power department for me, but that's not to say they don't have value in the game. Just because it's not my style, doesn't mean you can't make it work. - 2025 Projection: 27/1/12/.253/.303/.326/11 Prime Projection: 76/5/41/.278/.332/.346/46

128) Luke Raley - SEA, 1B/OF, 30.6 - Raley is a strong side of a platoon bat who just put up his 2nd straight season of a 119 wRC+. He has a very fantasy friendly power/speed combo with a 90.1/95.1 MPH AVG/FB EV, 13.5 degree launch, and 28.9 ft/sec sprint. It resulted in 22 homers and 11 steals in 455 PA. The problem is that the plate approach is awful (29.7/5.9 K%/BB%), the 116 combined Runs and RBI is lacking, and he just doesn't get enough playing time to be a coveted fantasy player. In weekly lineup leagues, he's tough to use ever. In daily lineup leagues at least you can play the matchups, and he could be more than useful there. 2025 Projection: 58/20/61/.240/.315/.448/12

129) Ryan O’Hearn - BAL, 1B/OF, 31.8 - O'Hearn is a strong side of a platoon bat who doesn't hit quite enough homers, or hit for quite a high enough average to overcome the cap on plate attempts. He hit .264 with 15 homers in 494 PA. He's a really good hitter with a .351 xwOBA, and the plate skills took a big step forward in 2024 with a career best 14.0/9.3 K%/BB%, so there is certainly value here in daily leagues, but you also have to take into account the massive playing time pressure with Mayo, Basallo, and Kjerstad all ready to break in. He's a nice fantasy bench bat in medium to deeper leagues. 2025 Projection: 52/15/56/.270/.327/.439/3

130) Trevor Larnach - MIN, OF, 28.1 - Larnach is a basically a power only strong side of a platoon bat, and he just hasn't shown enough game power over his career (19 homers in 162 game career average) to get too excited for him. It seems he should hit more homers with a 90.9 MPH EV and 13.6 degree career launch, but he just hasn't. The good news is that he massively improved his hit tool and contact rates. It honestly might be the biggest one year improvement I've ever seen. He went from a 36.5% whiff% and 34% K% in 2023 to a 27.9% whiff% and 22.3% K% in 2024. The improved hit tool definitely levels him up, but it's still a pretty low upside platoon bat. - 2025 Projection: 64/19/64/.247/.330/.430/3

131) Max Kepler - PHI, OF, 32.2 - Kepler's career has been an absolutely wild ride of ups, downs, and mismatched underlying/surface numbers, but at 32 years old, coming off a season where he put up a 95 wRC+ in 105 games that ended with knee tendinitis, his evaluation gets a lot easier. He's a super low end win now piece for medium to deeper leagues. He very well might have a full time job after Philly paid him $10 million, and the 20.1% K%, 88.9 MPH EV, and 16.8 degree launch should still be good enough to pop some dingers. - 2025 Projection: 68/20/66/.248/.318/.427/1

132) Andrew Benintendi - CHW, OF, 30.9 - Benintendi hit 20 homers for the first time since his rookie year that seemed to be a launching point for a near elite dynasty asset career, but we all know that it didn't play out like that. Those 20 homers in his rookie year came with 20 steals, 84 Runs, 90 RBI and a .271 BA. In 2024, it came with 3 steals, 50 Runs, 64 RBI, and a .229 BA. And with a 68 MPH swing, those 20 homers seem like a best case scenario. The White Sox lineup also isn't getting better anytime soon, so you can basically count on Benintendi for nothing. Super low end win now piece. - 2025 Projection: 64/15/64/.253/.315/.396/6

133) Daulton Varsho - TOR, OF, 28.9 - Varsho underwent rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder in mid September which is expected to delay the start of his season. Shoulder surgery that takes you right into the season is not a great starting point, and Varsho's star has already been dimming pretty hardcore over the last two years. He just isn't a good hitter with a career .293 xwOBA in 577 games. The K rate is high (26.7%), the EV is low (86.1 MPH), and while the launch/speed profile makes him fantasy friendly, it's just not good enough to overcome that he isn't a good hitter. Even if his plus outfield defense gets on the field, the upside isn't that high anymore, and I'm not sure how much longer his defense is going to actually give him a full time job. Especially now coming off the shoulder surgery. - 2025 Projection: 58/16/52/.225/.297/.414/10

134) MJ Melendez - KCR, OF, 26.4 - There might come a day where the surface stats actually catch up to the underlying numbers, but after three straight years of underperforming the underlying numbers (.305 career wOBA vs. .325 career xwOBA), I just can't keep on banging my head against the wall and expecting a different outcome. Even the underlying numbers took a step back in 2024 with a career low 8.4% Barrel%, and KC's bad hitter's park isn't doing him any favors either. I still see the 91.1/95.3 MPH AVG/FB EV, 14.6 degree launch, and 25.1% K%, and say how is this guy not hitting 25+ dingers per year. He's never even hit 20 homers, which is wild. He hits lefties worse than righties and he's a bad defensive player, which makes him a low end platoon bat, although KC has such a dearth of options in the OF, he could play everyday regardless (which isn't necessarily a positive thing for us in fantasy either). 2025 Projection: 60/20/66/.230/.313/.424/5

135) Jordan Beck - COL, OF, 23.11 - The thing that makes me most worried about Beck right now is his very, very slightly below average 71.4 MPH swing. And it's on the long side at 7.7 feet. The reason I'm hyper focused on that is because he also has major strikeout issues with a 35.3/6.5 K%/BB% in his 55 game MLB debut, which led to a cover your eyes 32 wRC+. I can handle big strikeout issues in your debut if the bat was electric, but the cold hard stats say the bat actually isn't electric. Speaking of electricity though, he is most certainly an electric athlete at 6'2'', 225 pound with plus speed (28.6 ft/sec sprint) and plus raw power (90.2 MPH EV with 8 homers in 39 games at Triple-A). The RF job is wide open for him in the short term, and with a good spring, I think the Rockies want him to win it. Tack on Coors Field which should theoretically help his biggest weakness (hit tool), and you still have an enticing player here. I just think that risk is creeping up more and more on him, and while there is opportunity right now, Colorado has a lot of good OF options right behind him. - 2025 Projection: 43/12/45/.233/.305/.418/12

136) Luis Matos - SFG, OF, 23.5 - The ballpark absolutely destroys Matos. In the right park, Matos could be an impact player, but in SF, a lift and pull approach with mediocre EV's is just a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what happened in 2024 with a 60 wRC+ in 45 games. In another park, plus contact (15.4% K%) with a 51.2% Pull% and 44.9% FB% could thrive, but with a 87.6 MPH EV at Triple-A (and 86.9 MPH in the majors), that ballpark is just going to eat him up. To be fair, Matos actually hit well at home and horrible on the road, but I still don't really think that changes my narrative at all. I'm looking towards the future, and I don't see it working there. He also doesn't run quite enough with 0 steals in the majors and 8 steals in 81 games in the minors. And while the contact rates are double plus to elite, the approach is terrible with a 40.1% Chase%. I'm not loving the upside in his current environment even if he can win a full time job in the next few years, which I think he can. - 2025 Projection: 31/9/36/.238/.302/.396/5 Prime Projection: 74/18/73/.251/.318/.420/12

137) Matthew Lugo - LAA, OF, 23.10 - Lugo had a monstrous breakout at Double-A this season, slashing .315/.405/.664 with 11 homers, 9 steals, and a 21.1/11.7 K%/BB% in 43 games. It's also not the first time he's had a huge season. He had a big time year in 2022 as well. His numbers dropped off at Triple-A, but he still performed well with a 107 wRC+, 5 homers, 7 steals, and a 27.0/8.5 K%/BB% in 35 games. His raw power is currently below average with a 86.5 MPH EV, but there is still some projection on his frame at 6'1'', so that can easily tick up in his mid 20's, and best of all, he's a lift and pull machine, so he'll get the most out of his raw power. He also has good speed and went 16 for 17 on the bases in 79 total games. The hit tool is below average and the talent probably isn't quite big enough to just overlook that, but a lift and pull profile with speed is very fantasy friendly, and he's knocking on the door of the bigs. I'm starting to like Lugo a decent amount in medium to deeper leagues as proximity play. 2025 Projection: 21/5/28/.229/.290/390/3 Prime Projection: 76/19/74/.246/.313/.420/11

138) Gavin Cross - KC, OF, 24.2 - Cross bounced back in 2024 from a disappointing first full year of pro ball, slashing .261/.342/.428 with 15 homers, 30 steals, and a 24.1/10.3 K%/BB% in 101 games at Double-A. It was good for a 115 wRC+. It certainly has his value back on the rise, and while this isn't the player many were hoping to see after getting selected 9th overall, there is still an intriguing power/speed combo in here for fantasy. He doesn't smash the ball, but the raw power is solid, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He's not a burner, but he has speed, and he's been an excellent base stealer throughout his career, going 30 for 32 this year. The two biggest issues are that the hit tool is below average, and KC is absolutely death (dead last) for lefty homers. It seems like a recipe for a low BA and limited homers. If Cross played in a different park, I might be enticed by the profile, but in KC, I'm a little worried it's going to be lackluster. 2025 Projection: 19/5/24/.221/.298/.391/7 Prime Projection: 74/18/76/.242/.318/.421/18

139) Masataka Yoshida - BOS, OF, 31.8 - Yoshida is a super boring fantasy player at his best with a BA first profile, moderate power, and little speed. And at his worst he is a low upside platoon bat, which is almost unrosterable except in very deep leagues. He's terrible vs lefties (.565 OPS), he's terrible on defense, and Boston is about to be stacked, so I'm leaning that he's a strict platoon bat. I'm out on Yoshida for the vast majority of leagues. - 2025 Projection: 66/14/66/.282/.340/.420/4

140) Jarred Kelenic - ATL, OF, 25.8 - It's sad to say that Kelenic has settled in as a strong side of a platoon bat, and that is at best. When Acuna returns, he could be out of a job completely. He put up an 86 wRC+ in 131 games and he has a career 86 wRC+ in 383 games. You can say he got unlucky last year with a .308 xwOBA vs. .294 wOBA, but he's gotten "unlucky" every year of his career, and that xwOBA is still below average. The hit tool just couldn't hack it. His 29.6% K% was actually a career best, but he needed to drop his BB% to a career low 7.1% to do it. That power (15 homers with a 9.9% Barrel%) and athleticism (7 steals with a 27.9 ft/sec sprint) are still there, but he can't hit lefties (.516 OPS in 72 PA), and hoping for hit tool improvement at this point seems like wishful thinking. He's only 25, so I guess you never know though. 2025 Projection: 46/13/44/.241/.308/.416/8

141) Addison Barger - TOR, 3B/OF, 25.5 - Barger isn't a good defensive player (although he played a good RF last year), which makes it harder for a fringy type like him to get playing time, but out of all of Toronto's fringy players, I want to bet on his bat the most. I've always gushed over his swing, and seeing his near elite 74.3 MPH bat speed just backs up my visual evaluation. That level of bat speed is not to be trifled with, and while he's had some hit tool troubles throughout his career, he's shown improvement there in the upper minors over the last two years. He put up a very respectable 19.3/16.1 K%/BB% in 57 games at Triple-A this year, and he wasn't too bad in the majors either with a 27.6% whiff% and 26.7% K% (albeit with a .239 BABIP fueled .197 BA). As you know from that bat speed, he hits the ball hard with a 90.1 MPH EV at AAA and a 8.7% Barrel% in the majors. The MLB debut was rough with a 70 wRC+ in 69 games, but like I mentioned, some of that was bad luck, and seeing the contact rates not implode is encouraging. He doesn't run a ton, but a 28 ft/sec sprint shows he's a good athlete. He doesn't seem to have a spot right now, but I would hesitate to write him off with that type of bat speed. I'm side eying him. - 2025 Projection: 44/16/53/.238/.314/.428/4

142) Joey Loperfido - TOR, OF, 25.11 - Toronto has a lot of interesting fringy players who are going to Battle Royale it out for playing time. And that battle is sure to go into the season, so predicting who will emerge is quite hard. In most leagues, you probably want to wait to see who emerges, and then try to jump on them quickly, rather than hold any of them, but in deeper leagues, you might not have that luxury. Loperfido is one of those players, and since he has the ability to play CF (he was an above average CF in his 20 games at the position), his glove could give him a leg up on large role in 2025. His MLB debut was rough due to a 36.3/5.0 K%/BB% that led to a 74 wRC+. He's almost 26 years old and he also had a 28% K% at Triple-A. I'm not saying he can't improve there, but expecting major improvement is probably a low probability outcome. What you are buying is the very real power/speed combo. He's 6'3'', 220 pounds with a 90.8 MPH EV at AAA and a 28.8 ft/sec sprint. It led to 13 homers and 9 steals in just 39 games at the level. It dropped off in the majors with an 88.3 MPH EV, leading to only 4 homers and 4 steals in 81 games, but if he can figure out the hit tool, we know the ability is in there to do much better than that. Considering his age and consistent hit tool issues, he profiles more as a 4th OF, but the fantasy friendly skillset is in here if he gets playing time and makes the necessary improvements. - 2025 Projection: 51/13/51/.226/.302/.412/11

143) Henry Davis - PIT, C/OF, 25.6 - Davis was one of my biggest misses in 2024, and while I believe my process was sound and I don't regret calling him a target, it was still a miss. Not only didn't he improve from his rookie year in 2023, everything got worse. He put up a 85.3 MPH EV (88.6 MPH in 2023), a 4.8% Barrel% (7% in 2023), a .224 xwOBA (.291 in 2023), and a 36.9% K% (27.1 in 2023) in 37 games. There was all this buzz about him going to driveline and improving his bat speed, and while he did swing an above average 72.5 MPH bat, it obviously didn't matter. He had an opportunity to lock down Pitt's catcher job and he couldn't do it, letting Joey Bart slide into the job. Endy Rodriguez will also return to compete for at bats behind the plate, leaving Davis in competition with a gaggle of players for outfield and catcher reps. The only silver lining, if you can call it that, is that he obliterated Triple-A with a 148 wRC+ in 57 games. I'm far from giving up on him completely or labeling him a bust, but the bottom line is that he just no longer is someone to target, even on the low end. He's a 25 year old who isn't good on defense and has struggled in the majors. Yea, there is still potential in the bat, but that just isn't a unique profile. A lot of guys fit into that. He's fine to roster, but this isn't a case of where I'm going back to the well. - 2025 Projection: 31/8/33/.223/.298/.402/3

144) Drew Gilbert - NYM, OF, 24.6 - A hamstring injury knocked out 3 months of Gilbert's season, and he couldn't get comfortable until the final month where he went bonkos with 9 homers, 2 steals, and a 16.2/10.3 K%/BB% in his last 29 games at Triple-A. It was more of the same in the AFL with 3 homers and a 5/8 K/BB in 11 games. But the batting average didn't follow behind with a .200 BA in the AFL and a .222 BA during that hot streak at Triple-A, and I'm not sure it's purely bad luck. He only had a 85 MPH EV at Triple-A to go along with a 46.9% FB%, which is a recipe for a low batting average. The Mets ballpark also isn't the right park for that kind of profile with it being one of the worst parks for lefty homers this year. He's had less extreme flyball rates in the past, but with the mediocre at best EV's, I don't think it's going to matter much, and while he runs a bit, it doesn't seem like he will rack up steals. He's close to the majors and he can definitely end up a solid fantasy player, but it's not someone I'm going after unless it's a deeper league. - 2025 Projection:.25/5/29/.235/.301/.395/3  Prime Projection: 76/18/74/.251/.322/.428/13

145) Wilfred Veras - CHW, OF, 22.4 - Veras is one of my favorite underrated proximity stashes in the minor leagues right now. He has that perfect mix of talent, upside, production, path to playing time, and absolutely non existent hype. He's 6'2'' with a big righty swing that has easy plus power potential, and he used that to club 16 homers in 128 games at Double-A. He's not a burner but he loves to run, stealing 25 bags in 34 attempts, and I don't see why Chicago wouldn't let him run, especially if they are going to be bad for the next few years. And the most exciting part is that he at least hinted at improving his well below average plate approach in the 2nd half of the season with a 23.2/8.7 K%/BB% in his final 70 games. He was only 21 years old in the upper minors with a 118 wRC+, and his biggest weakness, the plate approach, showed signs of improving. I love taking some high risk, high reward shots on guys who aren't teenagers, so Veras is in that perfect zone of upside and proximity for a cheap price that isn't always easy to find. - 2025 Projection: 27/8/36/.221/.280/.389/5 Prime Projection: 69/22/78/.246/.309/.442/13

146) Gabriel Rincones - PHI, OF, 24.1 - Rincones is a powerfully built 6'3'', 225 pounds with easy plus power, and in his first shot at the upper minors in 2024, he dominated. He slashed .263/.357/.487 with 11 homers, 20 steals, and a 25.6/11.6 K%/BB% in 59 games at Double-A. It was good for a 141 wRC+. He's not a burner, so don't expect big steal totals in the bigs, but he should at least be a contributor in the category. He's a corner outfielder and there are hit tool issues, but I'll bet on a guy who looks the part, hits the ball hard, disposed of Double-A immediately, and is knocking on the door of the bigs. The biggest issue is that he's terrible vs. lefties, so it might end up in a platoon role. 2025 Projection: 18/5/24/.228/.298/.420/4 Prime Projection: 68/23/75/.245/.323/.462/9

147) Cole Carrigg - COL, OF, 22.10 - I really wish we could have seen Carrigg at Double-A, because it's hard for me to buy in too hard here as an advanced college bat in the lower minors. The Rockies High-A park is also notoriously hitter friendly, with many of their hitters immediately falling off in their Double-A ballpark. At best, you can use his lack of time at Double-A as a buying opportunity, because there is a lot to like, but at worst, it could be a trap. The rosy outlook on Carrigg is that he's 6'2'', 200 pounds with about average power (16 homers in 111 games at High-A), an average hit tool (19.0/9.8 K%/BB%), double plus baserunning (53 steals), and defensive versality which should add value. The less rosy outlook is that the hit tool drops to below average at higher levels and he won't have the power to make up for it, relegating him to a utility role. If we saw it at Double-A, I would be more apt to buy into the first narrative, but until I do, I'm staying a little cautious. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/16/67/.262/.323/.417/28

148) Miguel Bleis - BOS, OF, 21.1 - We already knew that Bleis was not going to be that rocket ship elite prospect that we hoped for after his disappointing 2023 season, and as often happens with these uber talented, close to a breakout but never quite breaks out prospects (see Alex Ramirez), they can just sit in the breakout waiting room for years, sometimes all the way into their late 20's. So I fear Bleis is going to get comfortable in this breakout waiting room, but that is where he is after another mediocre at best season. He conquered Single-A with a 123 wRC+, but he was a 20 year old repeating the level, and he struggled when he got to the more age appropriate High-A with a 70 wRC+ in 50 games. That hit tool is still quite raw with a .221 BA on the season. The good news is that the upper echelon talent is still here with 11 homers, 38 steals, and a lift and pull profile. The hit tool isn't good, but a 21.4/9.1 K%/BB% isn't too bad. He also has a good glove in the OF. Is he just Alex Ramirez 2.0? Probably. But even Alex Ramirez can still breakout down the line, and Bleis certainly can too. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/20/71/.241/.309/.417/23

149) Yophery Rodriguez - MIL, OF, 19.4 - Rodriguez didn't have the flashiest season with 7 homers, 7 steals, a .726 OPS and a 23.8/12.2 K%/BB% in 110 games at Single-A, but it resulted in a 117 wRC+, and when you take into account he was an 18 year old who skipped over stateside rookie ball, it's much more impressive. He has a whip quick lefty swing, and he has good size at 6'1'', 185 pounds, so he should be able to get to above average to plus power at peak. He's also an excellent athlete who signed for $1.5 million in 2023, although he needs to improve his base stealing (19 for 31 in his career and 7 for 12 this year). More refinement is needed in all areas of his game, which is to be expected at this stage in his career, but it's not hard to see an above average across the board player at peak. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 82/22/80/.266/.344/.451/10

150) Yanquiel Fernandez - COL, OF, 22.3 - Fernandez simply didn't have a good enough year for a bat only prospect. He put up a 98 wRC+ with 12 homers in 122 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. The plate approach is really bad (7.2% BB%), the hit tool is below average (.262 BA with a 19.4% K%), he's almost a literal zero in steals, and the launch isn't great either with a 44.1% GB%. Don't get me wrong, I still love that sweet lefty swing and big power potential, but his bat really needed to be pretty bulletproof as the climbed the minors, and it just wasn't in 2024. He's a guy who is going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. I don't hate him, but it's just not a profile that deserves to get ranked very highly right now. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.228/.281/.398/0 Prime Projection: 66/24/71/.251/.318/.451/1

151) Eduardo Beltre - MIN, OF, 18.6 - Beltre was one of the top DSL breakouts, slashing .326/.453/.618 with 11 homers, 10 steals, and a 23.8%/15.5% K%/BB% in 43 games. Those 11 homers were tied for 2nd in the league with Arnaldo Lantigua, and behind only Emil Morales' 14 bombs. He has an athletic righty swing with no doubt power. The K rate is a bit high and the tools aren't necessarily off the charts at 5'll'', but he signed for $1.5 million, so we are talking about a legit prospect here. His swing and offensive profile reminds me a lot of Orlevis Martinez, maybe with a bit less power and bit more speed. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.252/.333/.458/9

152) Paulino Santana - TEX, OF, 18.4 - Leodalis De Vries, Paulino Santana, and Emil Morales were my top 3 targets from last year's international class, and while De Vries and Morales have gone full blow up, Santana is still sitting in a very reasonable price range. He didn't hit for nearly enough power to be a coveted prospect with 0 homers in 53 games in the DSL, but everything else was there with a 14.6/20.0 K%/BB%, 20 steals, and a 142 wRC+. He's a projectable 6'2'', 180 pounds and he didn't have any major groundball or pull issues with a 35.4% flyball percentage and a 49% Pull%, so the game power should tick up naturally over time as the raw power starts coming in. The super quick and super athletic righty swing that made me fall in love with him is still fully present. The big breakout hasn't come yet, but I still think it's coming down the line. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/20/76/.278/.347/.446/28

153) Henry Bolte - OAK, OF, 21.8 - Bolte came into pro ball as a high risk, high reward $2 million dollar signing bonus 2nd round pick, and he's still a super talented high risk, high reward prospect. He's a tooled up 6'3'', 195 pounds who most certainly looks the part, and he showed off that upside at High-A with 11 homers, 28 steals, and a 159 wRC+ in 69 games. He showed off the risk too with a 31.8% K% and 54.5% GB%, and then he went to Double-A and the strikeout rate exploded to 38.8% in 54 games. Even with the high K rate though, his talent still shined in the upper minors in his age 20 year old season with 4 homers, 18 steals, and a 107 wRC+. The extremely high strikeout and groundball rates show how raw he still is, but if he can put up these kind of numbers this raw, imagine the upside if he can actually start improving on those skills. Considering his age and upside, along with the fact he isn't really all that hyped of a prospect, I'm more than fine going after Bolte at fair value, and if you want to lean pure upside, there is an argument for him to be 4th on this list. Just know the likelihood that he busts completely is high. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/17/62/.228/.306/.419/19

154) Chas McCormick - HOU, OF, 30.0 - I really liked McCormick coming into 2024, and he had such a terrible year I almost forgot he existed. It came out of nowhere too, as all of a sudden his EV dropped almost 2 MPH to 86.2 MPH, and everything else dropped with it. He ended the year with a 66 wRC+, 5 homers, and 8 steals in 94 games. I want to blame an injury or something, and he did injure his hamstring very early into the season, but the 28.7 ft/sec sprint was excellent, so blaming the injury seems like an excuse. The two major things he has going for him are that Houston's entire OF is wide open, and that his 2024 was such an outlier, he almost has to bounce back closer to career norms in 2025. He has a career .250 BA and the skills are there to go 20/20, but coming off the disastrous season, that feels like wishful thinking. A weak side of a platoon role (he hits lefties better than righties in his career) might be where he ends up. And he's 30 years old already. - 2025 Projection: 55/15/55/.240/.311/.410/13

155) Jonny DeLuca - TBR, OF, 26.9 - DeLuca was one of my favorite low key targets coming into the season, and the Rays did indeed teach him how to raise his launch considerably (16.2 degree launch), trying to give him that classic hit/lift/pull profile, but it just didn't click how they hoped (or I hoped) it would. He hit only 6 homers with a 84.6 MPH EV and .217 BA in 107 games. He didn't hit the ball hard enough to make it work, and the 21.3/6.6 K%/BB% wasn't good enough either. The Rays don't look to be giving up on him, penciling him as the starting CF (he's above average defensively), so if he hits the weight room and starts hitting the ball harder, maybe it can click in year two for him. He also has the speed (16 steals with an elite 29.8 ft/sec sprint) to give him upside if he can start to hit the ball harder. He won't have the Trop to help him out though even if he can, instead hitting at Yankee Stadium 2.0, which is not a good park for that kind of profile. He's a very low end flier right now. - 2025 Projection: 59/12/57/.234/.303/.381/19

156) Vance Honeycutt - BAL, OF, 21.10 - Selected 22nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Honeycutt is an elite athlete at 6'3'', 205 pounds with a plus to double plus power/speed combo (he went 28/28 in 62 games in the ACC) and plus CF defense. The only reason he even fell to 22nd, was because he is a strikeout machine with a 27.5% K%, and unfortunately, that risk was at the forefront in his pro debut with a 36.1% K% in 8 games at Single-A and a 55% K% in 5 games at High-A. The odds that he simply won't be able to hit MLB pitching nearly well enough to let his tools shine are quite high, but expecting the hit tool to be magically fixed in his first taste of pro ball was unrealistic. It was also a small sample. Let's see what Baltimore can do with him over a full off-season and season, because his upside is tremendously exciting. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 73/20/71/.223/.302/.428/17

157) James Tibbs III - SFG, OF, 22.6 - Selected 13th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, James Tibbs the Third sounds like he comes from generational wealth, in a family that can trace their lineage back to pre Revolutionary War times. I think his great great great great great great grandfather led the charge at Bunker Hill. He straight up even looks like one of those old timey pictures of a Civil War general. His bloodlines are so refined that he steps up to the plate with his pinkie up, and it's no surprise that he has one of the more refined plate approaches in the draft with a 11.6%/18.1% K%/BB% in 66 games. He's not a super tooled up guy at 6'0'', 200 pounds, but he has a powerful lefty swing that produced 28 homers in the ACC this year and 55 homers in 176 games in his career. He can definitely hit it hard. San Francisco is just about the worst landing spot for him as I'm not sure he has the no doubt raw juice to make him ballpark proof, which is why I'm lower on him than his draft slot. His mediocre pro debut also didn't assuage my fears about his lack of upside with a .636 OPS and 31/6.9 K%/BB% in 26 games split between Single-A and High-A. The only scenario I would honestly see myself drafting him is in like a 30 team league, or if he falls so far I simply don't have a choice (and even then I might keep on passing). Maybe this ranking is too low, but he's just not my guy. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/20/75/.261/.330/.432/8

158) Elijah Green - WAS, OF, 21.4 - I almost wrote Green off completely this year after putting up a quite ridiculous 44% K% in 106 games at Single-A as a 20 year old, and honestly, maybe I still should, but it's so important to shoot for upside in the vast majority of dynasty leagues when it comes to prospects, that I believe his upside is still worth the shot in this area of the rankings. Even with that stupid strikeout rate, he still slashed .262/.342/.487 with 9 homers, 25 steals (only one caught stealing), and a 41.4/10.4 K%/BB% in his last 51 games. I don't even want to do that whole "if he can improve his hit tool" spiel because I couldn't even do it while keeping a straight face with that dumb stupid strikeout rate, but on the say 5-10% chance he can get that strikeout rate into the 30-35% range by his mid 20's, there is dangerous power/speed combo lurking in here to do the rest at an uber athletic 6'3', 225 pounds. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 59/21/72/.221/.302/.418/17

159) George Wolkow - CHW, OF, 19.3 - Wolkow was one of my favorite underrated FYPD Targets last off-season, and while he certainly still has his problems, he more than put his name on the map in 2024. The 6'7'' behemoth obliterated the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 148 wRC+ in 15 games, and then he got called up to Single-A as a an 18 year old and cracked 11 homers with 6 steals and a 126 wRC+ in 76 games. This is a no joke unicorn type talent, but like a lot of no joke unicorn type talents, the hit tool is a major question. And for Wolkow, it's getting close to off the charts with a 38.8% K% at stateside rookie and a 40.6% K% at Single-A. He walks a lot too, and he's very young, but that really isn't a strikeout rate you just hand wave away. It's why he really can't be close to consideration for a Top 100 spot, but it won't stop me from valuing him in the Top 200 range. The deeper you get into prospects rankings, the higher the bust rates become for everyone, so why not swing for the fences with a guy like Wolkow. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 75/28/87/.237/.319/.470/9

160) Brailer Guerrero - TBR, OF, 18.9 - Guerrero suffered a torn labrum which required surgery in 2023, limiting him to just 7 games in the DSL, and then that surgically repaired shoulder once again gave him problems in 2024, ending his season in late July after 28 games at stateside rookie ball. But he showed enough in those 28 games to take on the added injury risk. He's a big and physical 6'1'', 215 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that smokes the ball. He slashed .330/.452/.466 with 2 homers, 13 steals, and a 25.4/17.5 K%/BB%. He's not a burner, but he's a good athlete, and he signed for $3.7 million in 2023, which tells you the type of talent he has. He hit the ball on the ground too much (50%), he struck out too much, and there is injury risk, but there is also big upside in here. The shoulder injuries are really just creating a larger buy window here than there should be. And he'll still be just 18 years old for half of 2025, so there is plenty of time for development. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/26/87/.257/.326/.469/9

161) Yorger Bautista - SEA, OF, 17.6 - Bautista looks like he was born with a bat in his hands when you watch him swing. He moves that bat in a totally controlled way like a samurai warrior, coolly crushing everything that comes his way with both power and contact. He was always known for his good feel to hit, and then he got much bigger and stronger at a rock solid 6'1'', 175 pounds, so he can end up with a truly potent hit/power combo. Then tack on the fact he also has plus speed, and you have one of, if not the most enticing prospects in the international class. I have Gonzalez #1 one right now, but Bautista is 1A for me. It's a coin flip with the tie going to Gonzalez' superior perceived value. I don't think you are going to have to go even close to this high to grab Bautista. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 91/25/93/.277/.351/.473/21

162) PJ Morlando - MIA, OF, 19.11 - Morlando was selected 16th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, and if he was picked by a team who I respected (like Xavier Isaac in 2022, or Ralphy Velazquez in 2023, or Braylon Payne this year), I might be inclined to go after him as a potentially plus hit/power bat at 6'3'', 200 pounds without much defensive value, but I just don't trust the Marlins with hitters. Morlando getting picked this high by them just doesn't warrant a bump in my book. But having said that, he certainly has big talent at the dish with big raw power and a great feel to hit. The wide and low batting stance just isn't my favorite type of swing and it isn't conducive to big game power, so he'll likely need a swing change to fully tap into that raw power. He's also old for the class, while the previously mentioned Isaac, Ralphy, and Payne were all young for the class. He got one plate attempt at Single-A before his season ended with a lumbar stress reaction in his back. Bit of a bummer to see a back injury so early into his career, but you can't read too much into it at this point. There is appeal, but despite the high draft slot, I'm not going out of my way to get Morlando. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/23/82/.262/.333/.458/5

163) Chase Davis - STL, OF, 23.3 - The Ghost of Poor Pro Debut Past actually didn't have a bad year at all in 2024, but it wasn't that good either considering all the hype he had after the draft, proving the weight put on the poor debut was the proper evaluation. He slashed .252/.349/.417 with 12 homers, 9 steals, and a 23.8/11.8 K%/BB% in 112 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. He got a cup of coffee in the upper minors to close out the season and put up a 103 wRC+ in 8 games. He still has that smooth and athletic lefty swing, but the raw power has only been above average at best, and it comes with a low launch (47.5% GB%). He doesn't have the hit tool, speed or defensive value to really make up for the power not being standout. It's just not a very unique profile as a good but not great corner outfield bat, and I'm kinda being generous even saying "good" there. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 51/14/53/.251/.325/.423/5

164) Dante Nori - PHI, OF, 20.6 - Selected 27th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, the first thing that jumps out about Nori is that he's already an old man at 20.6 years old on Opening Day 2024. I thought he was going to need a walker to get to the podium. Being old for your high school class is so 2008, when Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers book came out. These days it's all about being 17 years old. But Philly isn't afraid to take old high schoolers, like they did with Aidan Miller last year, and they went back to that well in 2024 with Nori. Nori might be old, but his tools are undeniable with a built up 5'11'' frame, elite speed, a good feel to hit, a good glove in CF, and above average raw power. His grandfather was an assistant college baseball coach and his father is an assistant coach in the NBA. He has coaches' son in his veins. The profile also mostly transferred to pro ball with 0 homers (55.4% GB%), 4 steals, a 123 wRC+ and 21.2/24.1 K%/BB% in 14 games at Single-A. I'm usually scared off by old high school bats, and they don't get any older than Nori, but I'm intrigued enough by Nori's combination of floor and upside to not get too hung up on it. I like him. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 83/15/62/.264/.332/.418/30

165) Nelson Rada - LAA, OF, 19.8 - Rada is a tough evaluation as an 18 year old at Double-A, but let's try to parse through the numbers and skillset. The one thing that is for sure is that he has impact speed and baserunning ability. He stole 27 bags in 50 games in the DSL in 2022, 55 bags at Single-A in 2023, and 35 bags in 123 games at Double-A this season. The hit tool and ultimate power projection isn't as easy. He hit .234 with a 23.3% K% this year, but considering how young he was for the level, that can be considered pretty impressive. The only year he was at an age appropriate level, 2022 in the DSL, he hit .311 with a 12.6% K%. As a 17 year old at Single-A he hit .276 with a 18.1% K%. This could easily end up being a plus hit tool at peak with an easy and simple lefty swing. He also has a very strong plate approach with a 11.4% BB% and .331 OBP. He was excellent in that department his entire career. He's a plus CF, so his glove will keep him on the field, and his speed gives him a decent floor for fantasy. It's not hard to see a potent top of the order hitter ... if he can do enough damage when he does make contact. He's had extreme groundball rates his entire career (56.6% this year), he doesn't hit the ball hard, and he's already a decently filled out 5'8''. He's hit just 4 homers in 288 career games and just 1 this season. That says more bottom of the order hitter than top of the order, but considering how young he is, I don't want to rule out a power uptick down the line. If he can just get to 10+ homer power, there is impact top of the order potential in here. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/8/57/.268/.332/.372/25

166) Jared Thomas - COL, OF/1B, 21.9 - Selected 42nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Thomas gets the Coors bump, and he has enticing fantasy upside, but he also feels like the type of guy that Colorado never really gives a full chance to become a full time player. He performed well in his two years in the Big 12, slashing .349/.435/.635 with 16 homers, 18 steals, and a 20.6%/10.7% K%/BB% in 60 games in 2024. He's 6'2'', 190 pounds with room to tack on some more muscle, and he's a good athlete with above average speed and plus defense at 1B (he also can play CF, again showing off his athleticism). Add a star for being young for the class, and another another star for having a strong pro debut with 2 homers, 1 steal, a 19.4% K% and 146 wRC+ in 8 games at Single-A. 15/15 with 20/20 upside is in the cards here, and the hit tool will get as much help as possible in Coors. I like him relative to his lack of hype. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/71/.254/.325/.428/16

167) Luis Cova - MIA, OF, 18.2 - Cova was a popular international prospect breakout pick coming into the season, and while he didn't explode into truly coveted prospect territory, he did enough to have his value hold serve in the breakout waiting room. He hit 3 homers with 36 steals and a 10.0/15.3 K%/BB% in 55 games in the DSL. He only hit .239, but that was mostly due to bad BABIP luck, so I'm not too concerned about that considering the contact rates. He's a projectable and athletic 6'2'", so when the power ticks up to combine with the plate skills and speed, that big breakout could be right around the corner. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 82/18/69/.270/.338/.430/28

168) Cris Rodriguez - DET, OF, 17.2 - Rodriguez has some of the highest pure upside in the class, but he's not quite refined enough to really go after him too hard. He's 6'4'', 200 pounds with present power and more coming down the line. He's also a really good athlete with speed. The swing is definitely fast and powerful, but it's not really that natural or smooth, and he's had some hit tool issues. I like him, and he could easily emerge as a Julio Rodriguez type if it really all clicks, but that doesn't seem like the most likely outcome, to say the least. Still a really good upside pick. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 79/26/86/.251/.322/.461/16

169) Jake Fraley - CIN, OF, 29.10 - Fraley is in a strict side of a platoon role at best, and because he's not a good defensive player, he's at risk of being just a bench bat too. His offense isn't quite good enough to feel comfortable with him being locked into that role with a career 101 wRC+ and a 95 wRC+ in 2024. He gets the bat on the ball with a 18.3% K%, he runs with 20 steals in 116 games, and he gets on base with a .333 career OBP, but he's a guy who should get like 400-500 PA, and in fact he's never gotten more than 382 PA in his career. He simply doesn't hit the ball hard enough with a 84.3 MPH EV. - 2025 Projection: 58/12/47/.255/.333/.401/22

170) Jacob Young - WSH, OF, 25.8 - Young is a very bad offensive player, but he seems pretty locked into the starting CF (or as locked in as you can be while being this bad offensively) because he's a plus defensive CF and Washington doesn't have any other good options at the moment. He also runs, which makes him relevant for fantasy. He stole 33 bags with a 29.7 ft/sec sprint in 150 games, and that is basically all he does. He can get the bat on the ball with a 19.6% K%, but with a 1.6% Barrel% and 85.8 MPH EV, it still only led to a .648 OPS and .286 xwOBA. He's a 4th outfielder on a team who doesn't seem to have any other options. - 2025 Projection: 58/4/33/.248/.313/.325/21

171) Victor Scott - STL, OF, 24.2 - St. Louis is committed to playing the kids in 2024, and that could mean that Scott gets another extended look in center in 2025. He had a disaster 2024 with a 40 wRC+, 2 homers, 5 steals, and a 27.1/3.9 K%/BB% in 155 PA. The .179/.219/.283 triple-slash is pretty irredeemable, and he was nearly just as bad at Triple-A too with a slash of .210/.294/.303. He has elite speed, and he actually hit the ball decently hard with a 88.4 MPH EV, but his 2024 was so atrocious it's hard to overlook. I'm not betting on a legit bounce back even with the opportunity he seemingly still has in St. Louis, and with a still decent 400 NFBC ADP, he might not even be that cheap either. I see the appeal with his stolen base upside, but he's not one of my fliers. - 2025 Projection: 41/6/33/.228/.287/.346/19

172) Mike Sirota - LAD, OF, 21.10 - Selected 87th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Sirota was a potential first round pick coming into the season, but instead of having the big junior year breakout, he took a step back. He went from hitting 18 homers his sophomore year to just 7 homers in 51 games in the Colonial Athletic Conference his junior year. The hit tool isn't good enough to see the power take a step back with a 18.8% K%, and considering he's not from a major conference, the profile needed to be pretty bulletproof. But having said that, it could create a buying opportunity for our purposes. He's 6'3'', 188 pounds with plus speed and good raw power. The swing and stance is geared more for average than power, but he's young for the class, and hopefully pro instruction can get the most out of his raw power (I wrote this blurb just minutes before he got traded to the Dodgers, and now you have to feel even better about the Dodgers unlocking his power). He also has an excellent plate approach with a 23% BB%. He's most likely a 4th outfielder, but joining the Dodgers gives him the best chance possible of beating that projection. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/16/57/.246/.319/.418/19

173) Rodney Green - OAK, OF, 22.0 - Selected 104th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Green is a high risk/high reward college bat, and with Oakland's relative success with a very similar bat in Denzel Clarke, Green could be next in line. Granted, Clarke is both a bigger and better athlete, and he didn't strikeout as much as Green in college, so even Clarke could be a low percentage outcome. Regardless of comps, I like Green a lot at 6'3'', 190 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. And his strong pro debut made me like him even more, slashing .289/.368/.464 with 3 homers, 9 steals, and a 26.1/11.4 K%/BB% in 24 games. He put up a 28% K% his junior year, but he walked a ton, and he cracked 14 homers with 15 steals in 55 games. Seeing the hit tool remain solid at Single-A is a good first step. He lasted to 104th overall, so it's clear most teams don't think he will hit enough (although he did sign for almost $300K above slot at $1 million, so the threat of returning for his senior season also likely contributed to the drop), but if he does, the upside is substantial. He's a good later round upside in fantasy drafts if you don't want to draft a teenager. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 73/18/69/.228/.310/.423/18

174) Dylan Moore - SEA, SS/3B/2B/OF, 32.8 - Moore is a heavily used utility player whose most valuable format would be a deeper OBP, daily moves league. There is value in here if you can start him vs. lefites (.762 OPS vs .639 OPS vs. righties). He stole 32 bags in 441 PA, which is where he derives most of his value, and he can also pop some dingers with a 8.8% Barrel% and 22.6 degree launch, leading to 10 homers. The hit tool is brutal with a career .206 BA (.201 in 2024), but the .316 OBP is where he can be decent in OBP leagues. He currently has a full time job, but let's see what Seattle does the rest of the off-season. Even with a full time job, he's still just a medium to deep league role player. - 2025 Projection: 59/14/48/.210/.315/.396/28

175) Starling Marte - NYM, OF, 36.5 - Marte is in the last year of his deal, the Mets are full go win now mode, he can't stay healthy, and they have a plethora of prospects who are champing at the bit for an opportunity, so I don't think the 36 year old Marte's leash is going to be very long here. He's bad in the outfield now and he's never been a big on base guy. I'm just saying, I can easily see a drop in his age 36 year old season which will land him on the bench. Having said that, he hit .269 with 7 homers and 16 steals in 94 games last year (he hasn't played in more than 120 games since 2019), and the .337 xwOBA was directly in line with his career averages, so he definitely can keep beating those kids off with a stick and hold the job. He's in physical decline with a career worst, below average 27.1 ft/sec sprint, but he could steal bases if he was in a wheelchair. He's not the worst win now flyer, but certainly don't pay up for the name value, especially in dynasty. - 2025 Projection: 69/12/61/.267/.323/.402/24

176) Hunter Renfroe - KCR, OF, 33.2 - Renfroe had his 2nd straight season of a 92 wRC+, and at 33 years old and being a poor defensive player, he probably shouldn't be a starter anymore, but KC doesn't have many options. The 75.2 MPH swing is still elite, and the 19.8% K% was a career best, so it doesn't seem like he's washed quite yet, but this is still a very low end win now piece. And while there isn't a ton of good competition there, he still does have some competition. - 2025 Projection: 51/18/58/.238/.306/.431/1

177) Jake Meyers - HOU, OF, 28.10 - Meyers has a plus CF glove, and with how terrible Houston's outfield is right now, that is probably good enough for him to be a favorite for a near everyday job. He's really bad on offense with a career 87 wRC+ in 1,117 career PA, and while you can pull out some positives (a 6.8% Barrel% with an 88.2 MPH EV ain't terrible), the sample is large enough to know he's just not good on offense. And the profile isn't fantasy friendly either with only 11 steals in 148 games despite a 28.9 ft/sec sprint. Full time job or not, he's just not a very good option. - 2025 Projection: 59/15/67/.231/.302/.398/12

178) Jose Siri - NYM, OF, 29.8 - Siri seems to be the Mets starting CF at the moment, but I doubt it's a true everyday job, and the off-season isn't over. He's a plus defender in CF with a fun power/speed combo (18 homers and 14 steals in 130 games in 2024), but the hit tool is just brutal (.187 BA with a 37.9/6.9 K%/BB%). He's optimally a 4th outfielder at best. - 2025 Projection: 54/17/50/.215/.268/.406/14

179) Hunter Goodman - COL, C/OF, 25.6 - Goodman is not a good defensive catcher, making it more likely that Drew Romo is going to be Colorado's starting catcher of the future, and they don't really have openings in their short term or long term outfield either. I don't know where he fits in, but if he does work his way into playing time, the guy is going to jack dingers. His 74.9 MPH swing is elite, and it resulted in 13 homers in 70 MLB games with a 12.8% Barrel% to back it up. The hit tool and plate approach are atrocious though with a 28.6/3.6 K%/BB%, .190 BA, and .238 OBP. I just don't see him as more than a part time power bat long term, but I'm a sucker for that bat speed, he hits in Coors, and it's conceivable they give him a shot at catcher. - 2025 Projection: 33/10/41/.215/.278/.415/1

180) Jerar Encarnacion - SFG, OF, 27.5 - Encarnacion is highly likely to top out as a bench power bat, but he's a bench power bat with very real upside. His 77 MPH swing is almost all you need to know that his upside is very real. And he smashes the ball with a 15% Barrel% and 95 MPH EV in 35 games in the majors. It led to 5 homers and a .348 xwOBA. That xwOBA is no joke. The .301 wOBA wasn't as good, and I do think that matters, and the 28.6/4.2 K%/BB% is quite terrible, which I obviously think matters a ton. He's also not a high launch guy with a 6.7 degree launch. And he's bad on defense. It's a very classic bench power bat, but man, anybody who swings that fast and hits it that hard has at least some of my attention. - 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.237/.306/.424/2

181) Alexander Canario - CHC, OF, 24.11 - I was always visually amazed when watching Canario swing, writing, "he swings the bat like it’s a bazooka with an extreme all or nothing approach," in last year's Top 1,000 writeup, and now with bat speed tracking, we saw Canario put up an eye poppingly elite 78 MPH swing. It was in a small sample (40 swings), but that was 4th best in all of baseball. My eyes certainly weren't deceiving me, and it's what keeps Canario interesting to me for fantasy. He's going to rip dingers if he gets playing time, like he did at Triple-A with 18 homers and a 16.8% Barrel% in 64 games. He also keeps producing in the majors in small samples (despite an extremely high K%) with a 148 wRC+ in 17 PA in 2023 and a 128 wRC+ in 28 PA in 2024. The swing is on the long side and he strikes out a ton (30.4% K% at Triple-A), so the batting average is a major risk, and it may prevent him from ever really truly locking down a full time job, but that power upside is big enough to crack this list. 2025 Projection: 28/10/37/.223/.301/.438/2 Prime Projection: 64/25/78/.235/.314/.469/6

182) Everson Pereira - NYY, OF, 24.0 - Pereira's season ended on May 19th after undergoing elbow surgery. He was doing his usual big power, big strikeout thing before going down with the injury with 10 homers and a 32.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 40 games at Triple-A. That K rate at Triple-A is scary, and it was even worse when he got a shot in the majors in 2023 with a 38.8% K% and 43.1% whiff%. But strikeouts aside, Pereira is an exciting talent with the ability to crush the ball and above average speed. He's basically obliterated every stop of the minors. These guys generally get a shot at some point in time, often with the Miami Marlins of the world, and the fantasy upside is worth staying patient with. With Juan Soto now officially a goner, maybe Pereira's status in the Yankees organization gets a little bump, and even if he isn't handed a starting job (which he won't be), he might hang around in that next man up territory. He's a bit more interesting to me now than he was before Soto signing with the Mets. 2025 Projection: 28/10/35/.222/.291/.424/5 Prime Projection: 71/24/78/.235/.312/.454/12

183) George Valera - CLE, OF, 24.4 - Add Valera to the pile of Cleveland's strong corner depth. I don't know who is going to emerge out of this group, but at least a few of them will emerge over the next few years, and the ones that do can definitely make an impact. Valera had injuries slow his career and allowed others to catch up to him on the depth chart, so now he's in a dog fight like the rest of them. He had a strong year in 2024 with 17 homers, a 90.5 MPH EV and 27/12 K%/BB% in 90 games at Triple-A, showing off the power potential. He still has that damn smooth lefty swing. The best way to play Cleveland's fringier prospects are to probably wait to see who gets the opportunity, and then pounce, rather than hold on, but in deeper leagues you probably don't have that luxury. Something tells me that I still want to bet on Valera, but it will probably come as a strong side of a platoon bat. - 2025 Projection: 15/6/21/.221/.301/.424/1 Prime Projection: 66/23/73/.245/.327/.469/6

184) Johnathan Rodriguez - CLE, OF, 25.5 - Good teams know how to build depth, and Cleveland is building strong offensive depth basically at every position. It's great for real life, but it makes it very hard to know if and when a good but not great prospect will get an opportunity. Rodriguez is in that bucket as a slugger with no defensive value. He destroyed Triple-A, slashing .301/.390/.540 with 29 homers, 8 steals, and a 25.2/12.6 K%/BB% in 118 games. The 7.2 degree launch was low, but the 92.5 MPH EV more than made up for it. He didn't have a good MLB debut in a small sample with a .486 OPS in 40 PA, but he still put up a 91.3 MPH EV. If he gets playing time, there is little doubt that he will be fantasy relevant, but who knows when or if he will get playing time. - 2025 Projection: 18/6/24/.232/.307/.432/2 Prime Projection: 48/16/54/.244/.325/.457/ 5

185) Kala’i Rosario - MIN, OF, 22.9 - I just wrote Rosario up in yesterday's AFL Rundown, and it really encapsulates my thoughts perfectly on him: "An elbow injury knocked Rosario out for almost 3 months mid-season, and in the prospect world, you already know that out of sight, out of mind is a real thing, so it's great to see Rosario back in sight in the AFL. And he's making sure he gets seen with an absolute 113.1 MPH rocket for his first homer. He's 1 for 7 with 2 strikeouts overall. We all know that Rosario is a power hitting beast, and he hit 8 homers in 67 games in Double-A this year, but the reason he didn't crack my End of Season Prospect Rankings is because I don't like the 30.4% K% and 54.2% GB% combo. Huge power conquers all, so I'm not saying he can't overcome the K's and groundballs, but I don't love it. He ranked 211th for me last off-season, and he probably does deserve to rank at least in the Top 300 now too." - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/24/78/.238/.316/.452/5

186) Yeremi Cabrera - TEX, OF, 19.9 - Cabrera comes with both hit tool risk and some age to level risk, and he doesn't jump off the screen physically at 5'11'', but what does jump off the screen is his absolutely vicious lefty swing. That thing is made to launch the ball to the moon, and that is exactly what Cabrera did to stateside rookie ball, slashing .301/.348/.571 with 9 homers, 17 steals, and a 20.0/19.0 K%/BB% in 49 games. It was good for a 151 wRC+. He's a bit of a tweener age wise with his birthday smack dab in the middle of baseball season, so while I wouldn't say he was old for the level, he was on the older side, and when he got the call to Single-A, the numbers dropped off hard with 0 homers, a 73 wRC+ and a 29.8% K% in 23 games. It's fair to give him an adjustment period to full season ball, so I don't want to be too hard on him for that. It does underscore the risk in his profile, namely the hit tool risk, but his power/speed combo is legit, and that is what I love to chase in fantasy. He's high risk, high reward. ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/21/78/.244/.327/.438/19

187) Andres Valor - MIA, OF, 19.5 - Valor is a tooled up and projectable 6'3'', 180 pounds, and he had has 2nd strong season in rookie ball, slashing .289/.374/.421 with 2 homers, 35 steals, and a 25.1/8.8 K%/BB% in 54 games in stateside rookie ball. It was good for a 119 wRC+. He did basically exactly the same in the DSL in 2023. There is hit tool risk, he still needs to both add more power and tap into that raw power more, and he's only been good but not great in rookie ball, so it's a lotto ticket, but it's a high upside lotto ticket. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/19/71/.245/.317/.423/22

188) Braylin Morel - TEX, OF, 19.2 - Morel has now conquered both levels of rookie ball, cracking 7 homers with a 168 wRC+ in 47 games in the DSL in 2023, and then cracking 7 homers with a 142 wRC+ in 41 games at stateside rookie. He has a powerful righty swing at 6'2'', so the power is legit, and he's a good athlete with 12 steals. The hit tool is still a question though with a 23.6% K%, and he has to prove it in full season ball, but he can get pretty exciting with a good showing in 2025.  - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/22/75/.244/.319/.429/8

189) Braylin Antunez - MIL, OF, 17.4 -  At 6'0'', 194 pounds, Antunez' build, movements and type of athleticism remind me of an NBA point guard. He has present power, he's fast, and he has a good feel to hit. There might not be as much projection as some of the other long and lean builds in this class, but there is some Jasson Dominguez vibes in the sense he might be pretty filled out already, but it's the type of athleticism that he will maintain. Some of these guys could fill out and slow down considerably, while Antunez has already proven he can do both. I like him a lot, and how can you not trust Milwaukee after Chourio and Made. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 89/20/72/.266/.335/.434/28

190) Kenny Fenelon - MIL, OF, 17.6 - If Antunez (ranked above) isn't the next Milwaukee success story, it could be Fenelon. The 6'0'', 180 pound Fenelon might not be a particularly huge guy, but he's absolutely explosive on the field with both power and speed. He has a strong righty swing that already produces big power, and he's a good centerfielder with excellent athleticism. The hit tool has some risk to it, which is why he isn't getting hyped with the top guys in the class, and while I generally like taking shots on like a 6'3'' guy, Fenelon just looks explosive out there.  - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 73/22/77/.247/.318/.439/26

191) Andrew Salas - MIA, SS/OF, 17.1 - I can't deny that I'm starting to feel a little worn out/underwhelmed with the Salas family. I was a fan of Andrew's oldest brother, Jose Salas, and liked him as a breakout candidate, but he bottomed out hard in 2023 and 2024. His middle brother, Ethan, has been so insanely hyped for a while now, and his 2024 was underwhelming to say the least. And now here comes Andrew, who is is hit tool/plate approach first prospect with a moderate power/speed combo, which isn't my favorite profile to begin with. He's 6'2'', 185 pounds with a quick and controlled swing from both sides of the dish. With those bloodlines, we know he has an advanced feel for the game too. He's a floor over upside type, but it's not like he's devoid of upside, and his floor seems higher than your typical international prospect due to those bloodlines. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/21/77/.262/.326/.423/10

192) David Fry - CLE, C/1B/OF, 29.4 - Fry underwent surgery to repair a ligament in his elbow in early November with a 6-8 month timeline. That puts May as his earliest possible return date, and it could go into the 2nd half. That doesn't give him much of a shot to lock in a starting job, or at least a near everyday utility job. He's not a good defensive player, so he was always going to have to prove it every step of the way, and this surgery just seems like a terrible roadblock considering he's already 29 years old. The swing speed is below average, and the 90.3 MPH FB EV is also lackluster. He has 505 career MLB PA with a 124 wRC+, but some of that was luck with a career .341 wOBA vs. a .326 xwOBA. I was already torn on if he could truly be a full time player, and with the injury, it has me leaning towards mostly needing to see him healthy and raking again before truly placing a high value on him. - 2025 Projection: 34/8/38/.252/.330/.426/2

193) Tirso Ornelas - SDP, OF, 25.1 - Ornelas was once upon a time a popular sleeper bat back in 2018 as a 19 year old, and while he didn't have the explosion many hoped for, here he is popping back up on the radar in 2025. The 6'4'', sweet lefty swinging Ornelas slashed .297/.367/.497 with 23 homers, 7 steals, and a 16.1/9.7 K%/BB% in 128 games at Triple-A. The 87.6 MPH EV and 8.4 degree launch don't exactly scream big time power hitter in the majors, but the raw power is definitely in there, and the contact rates were really good. It's probably a bench bat long term, but San Diego is a very thin team right now, so Ornelas is in position to get plenty of at-bats in 2025 if injuries hit. It's also not out of the question for him to level up again if he can raise his launch, and his teammate Jackson Merrill is a perfect guy to talk to about that. He's not a bad underrated proximity bat at all for deeper leagues. - 2025 Projection: 21/5/27/.238/.303/.409/1 Prime Projection: 43/12/51/.260/.321/.435/3

194) Alejandro Osuna - TEX, OF, 22.6 - I've comped Osuna to pre-roids Melky Cabrera for a few years now, and in 2024, he's getting closer to the roids version of Melky. He slashed .292/.362/.507 with 18 homers, 17 steals, and a 23.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 102 games split between High-A (132 wRC+ in 45 games) and Double-A (151 wRC+ in 57 games). He's not a big guy at 5'9'', and while he can lift it and hit it fairly hard, he doesn't pull it a ton, and he doesn't project for big homer totals on the MLB level. The K/BB rates weren't exactly great and he's not a great base stealer (17 for 23 this year). He's a good ballplayer, and I see the appeal, but he's not really one of my guys. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/17/66/.261/.322/.420/14

195) Kahlil Watson - CLE, 2B/OF, 22.0 - Cleveland selecting Bazzana first overall is an absolute killer for Watson's path to playing time, but the biggest killer to his path to playing time is the hit tool. He just put up a 30.7% K% with a .220 BA in 96 games at Double-A. He was only 21 years old, so there is some age to level leeway you can give him, and he still put up a 104 wRC+, so he wasn't bad. The electric power/speed combo that made him a hyped high school prospect is still here with 16 homers and 15 steals. Even with the hit tool risk, I still like him for fantasy, but he has to get on the field in order to help us. And it just doesn't seem like a team is going to hand him a full time job anytime soon. This could shape up to be more of a mid to late 20's type breakout scenario. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/20/71/.233/.316/.425/15

196) Jesse Winker - NYM, OF, 31.7 - Winker returned from the dead in 2024 (118 wRC+) after a horrific 2023 (66 wRC+), but he tailed off after getting traded to the Mets, and he's likely in line for a platoon role at the very best. The biggest mystery is the 14 steals in 145 games after never having stolen more than 1 bag in a season. The new stolen base rules have created some truly wonky steal seasons. He stole 0 bags in 44 games with the Mets though, and it seems unlikely he even comes close to 14 again. A plus plate approach is his best offensive skill with a 20.9/12.4 K%/BB%, and he's more of a good all around hitter than a home run hitter, so a low upside platoon bat is just not a very enticing profile. - 2025 Projection: 55/14/50/.249/.350/.410/5

197) Mike Yastrzemski - SFG, OF, 34.7 - Yas is a mostly strong side of a platoon power bat who is likely nearing the end of his career. He'll pop dingers with a 10.5% Barrel%, 90.4 MPH EV, and 19.1 degree launch, but it's coming with a low BA (he hasn't hit better than .233 in 5 years), little speed (3 steals), and not many RBI/Runs (60/57). - 2025 Projection: 58/16/54/.230/.311/.438/3

198) Mitch Haniger - SEA, OF, 34.3 - Haniger is nearing the end of his career with a 71 wRC+ in 2023 and a 85 wRC+ in 2024, but he seems to be inline for a large share of the DH job in 2025, and he still hits the ball hard with a 90.6 MPH EV and 9% Barrel%. Super low end win now option for deep leagues only. - 2025 Projection: 44/14/48/.221/.300/.409/1

199) Jeff McNeil - NYM, 2B/OF, 33.0 - McNeil is on his last legs, and while the Mets could go with the vet at 2B, they have so many other good younger options (Acuna, Mauricio, Jett), I just doubt he holds onto the starting job for long even if he does win it. He just had his 2nd straight year of a well below average xwOBA, and he's now 33 years old. He can get the bat on the ball with a 14.4% K% and he plays a solid 2B, but that is about all he does well. He's a desperation option. - 2025 Projection: 44/8/35/.261/.323/.390/5

200) Kyle Stowers - MIA, OF, 27.3 - I really liked Stowers a few years ago as a power hitting, proximity play prospect. With a plus 73.7 MPH swing that is also very short at 6.8 feet, and with an above average 28.2 ft/sec sprint at 6'2'', 215 pounds, I'm happy that I wasn't hallucinating his very real talent, but the hit tool is just awful. He put up a 36.1% whiff% with a 35.4% K%. And it hasn't improved in 3 years in the majors. It led to a 67 wRC+ in 69 games, which is just horrific. The big power is for sure there with a 91 MPH EV and 10.0% Barrel%, but at this point, you just can't bet on that hit tool. He'll battle for at bats in 2025 with a path to playing time, so he's not the worst flier ever, but that is all he is. - 2025 Projection: 48/15/57/.221/.298/.421/3

201) Richie Palacios - TBR, 2B/OF, 27.11 - Palacios is likely locked into a bench role, and a strong side of a platoon role at best, but he just put up a .325 xwOBA with 19 steals, a .346 OBP and zero contact issues in 316 PA, so he's kinda interesting. He's always had excellent plate skills, and that continued in the majors with a 21.2/14.2 K%/BB%. He doesn't have a ton of pop with a 3.5% Barrel% and 5 homers, but it's not nothing, and he's a good baserunner, going 19 for 20. Tampa isn't exactly super deep, so injuries or underperformance from their starters, combined with Palacios hitting well, could result in a bunch of at bats for him and fantasy relevance. - 2025 Projection: 57/9/41/.248/.337/.385/17

202) Leody Taveras - TEX, OF, 26.7 - Leody looks to be out of a starting job after the Joc Pederson signing, and quite frankly, that is where he belongs. He's a 4th outfielder with average CF defense and a below average bat. He put up a 82 wRC+ in 2024 and he has a 85 career wRC+ in 1,743 PA. He actually doesn't do anything too poorly offensively with almost average underlying marks everywhere you look, but this is a case where the sum is less than the parts. And the sample is big enough to say that this is who he is. It's possible he can level up in his late 20's, but you can say that about a ton of guys, and he currently doesn't have a starting job. - 2025 Projection: 48/11/41/.254/.313/.400/19

203) Rece Hinds - CIN, OF, 24.7 - How can a guy who put up a 1.051 OPS with 5 homers and 2 steals in his 51 PA MLB debut not make this list? Well, I guess the answer to that question is by striking out 37.9% of the time and putting up a 68 wRC+ at Triple-A. Maybe he shouldn't make this list, but Hinds has very real upside, and he's close to the majors, so let's roll the dice. He's a very athletic 6'4'', 215 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He had a 29.2 ft/sec sprint with a 91.6 MPH EV and 18.9 degree launch in the majors. He smacked 14 homers with 20 steals in 99 games at Triple-A. If he can even strikeout just like 32% of the time, he could do some major fantasy damage, as he did in the majors with a 31.4% K%. Odds are he can't hit enough to become an MLB regular, but in shallower leagues especially, why not take a shot on this kind of close to the majors upside at this point in the rankings. - 2025 Projection; 16/6/21/.207/.266/.412/3 Prime Projection: 42/16/56/.219/.282/.432/10

204) Mac Horvath - TBR, 2B/3B/OF, 23.8 - Horvath is a lift and pull machine, so it's unsurprising that Tampa was intrigued by him in a mid-season trade, and it's an upgrade to get out of Baltimore's logjam. The hit tool is the real problem though with .229 BA and 25.9% K% in 102 games at High-A, and it got way worse after the trade to Tampa with a 34.6% K% in 31 games. He's an excellent athlete with power and speed, but his K rates have been very high in the lower minors, which is not a great sign for an advanced college bat. If anyone can make it work, it's Tampa, but often a guy like this ends up in a part time role for them in their mid to late 20's, which is only so helpful for fantasy. Still a decent upside shot though if the hit tool can improve. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/16/56/.233/.309/.422/18

205) Jud Fabian - BAL, OF, 24.6 - Fabian's contact rates always seem to be on the brink of total implosion before he brings them back off the ledge. He put up a 29.4% K% at Florida at 20 year old, before improving that to 22.3% in his age 21 season. He put up a 37.5% K% at Double-A in 2023, and then improved that in 2024 with a 29.9% K%. And then he got to Triple-A this year where he put up a 40.8% K% in 30 games, but we know how this story goes, and I'm expecting that to come down in 2025. Just how far down he can get it down against MLB pitching is the ultimate question, and while it seems likely he will never be able to get it down quite enough, the power/speed/defense trifecta is good enough to roster him in medium to deeper leagues on the off chance he can. He jacked out 20 homers with 16 steals in 128 games, and he put up a 117 wRC+ at Double-A. He'll compete with Beavers and Bradfield for bench at bats/next man up status in 2025, and while my money is one Beavers or Bradfield, don't completely count out Fabian. - 2025 Projection: 11/3/16/.210/.289/.389/2 Prime Projection: 55/18/53/.228/.309/.429/11

206) Colton Ledbetter - TBR, OF, 23.5 - Ledbetter was a 22 year old advanced college bat in the lower minors, so the 28.3/8.1 K%/BB% in 109 games at High-A isn't a great sign, but the power/speed numbers were there with 16 homers and 34 steals, and the 130 wRC+ was just fine as well. He hits the ball in the air a ton with a 28.6% GB%, and he's always been an excellent base stealer with some speed. It's likely he ends up in some kind of strong side of a platoon role with the Rays (he hits righties much better than lefties), but the power/speed combo is in here to make an impact when he gets on the field. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 56/15/61/.244/.318/.429/15

207) Luis Guanipa - ATL, OF, 19.4 - Guanipa was one of the top breakout targets from the 2023 international class, and while he's yet to truly explode, he remains a very enticing high upside option. He played well in the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 2 homers, 4 steals, a 12.3% K% and 112 wRC+ in 20 games, but he struggled hard when he got the ball to Single-A with a 42 wRC+ in 32 games. The 25.7/8.1 K%/BB% shows he wasn't completely lost, and at only 18 years old with very little pro experience, I wouldn't kill him too much for struggling there. Plus speed and potentially plus CF defense are his best two attributes right now, and he's starting to lock in at least a pretty good feel for contact. Contact, defense and speed is a pretty safe profile that also has fantasy upside. How much power he gets to is the ultimate question, and while he's an explosive player, he's not a big guy and he hit the ball on the ground a decent amount this year. He wasn't that to the moon prospect we hoped for, but there is still a nice little combination of floor and upside in here. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/16/66/.265/.325/.416/24

208) Dylan Dreiling - TEX, OF, 21.11 - Selected 65th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Dreiling is a proven SEC performer from the second he stepped on campus and is a complete hitter, slashing .342/.459/.715 with 23 homers, 4 steals, and a 20.5%/17.5% K%/BB% in 71 games at Tennessee. He hits the ball hard and he's a disciplined hitter. He's likely a corner outfielder, he's not a huge guy at 5'11'', 197 pounds, the K rate is a bit high, and he doesn't run much, so I'm not sure the upside is super high, but it's a testament to how deep this year's college bat class is that you can get a guy with these kind of numbers this late. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 68/18/74/.248/.324/.423/7

209) Dakota Jordan - SFG, OF, 21.11 - Selected 116th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft but signing for $2 million, Jordan is a beast at the dish at a rock solid 6'0'', 220 pounds, and he has the big power to back up the build with 20 homers in 63 games. I don't love the crouched batting stance, but he kinda rises up as the pitch comes, and it's an athletic swing, so I'm not holding it against him. The hit tool is the biggest issue with a 29% K%, and he also hits the ball on the ground a lot. That is not the best combo of skills to have, but hard hit ability can conquer all, and Jordan has done nothing but hit the ball hard and produce his entire career. If he landed somewhere other than SF, I could maybe see liking him more, but I just can't come around on him being one of my guys. Love the obvious huge power, but too many other things are going against him (contact, grounders, ballpark). - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/21/74/.226/.311/.434/4

210) Kevin Alvarez - HOU, OF, 17.2 - I love the guys where the bat looks like an absolute twig when they swing it, and that applies to the 6'4'', 185 pound Alvarez who has an easy, but lightning fast lefty swing. He's known for his advanced approach and good feel to hit, so when he adds more power onto on his projectable frame, this could end up a truly potent hit/power combo masher from a corner outfield spot. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 79/24/84/.263/.342/.451/8

211) Rayner Arias - SFG, OF, 18.11 - Arias was an absolute machine in the DSL in 2023 with 4 homers and a 230 wRC+ in 16 games, but he couldn't repeat that magic in stateside rookie in 2024 with 0 homers and a 98 wRC+ in 25 games. The 25.7% K% was too high, he showed no power and he's not great on the bases (3 for 6). He's had some injury issues in his young career (multiple wrist injuries after diving for balls in the OF), and considering the $2.7 million signing bonus at a projectable 6'2'', 185 pounds, some patience is prudent here. The down and injured 2024 has his stock dropping, but I want to give him one more year before really tanking him. ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/20/73/.257/.324/.428/9

212) Dairon Blanco - KCR, OF, 31.11 - Kyle Isbel is the main CF in KC, but it would be more fun for fantasy if it was Blanco. Blanco has elite speed with a 29.6 ft/sec sprint, and it led to 31 steals in just 88 games (and only 132 PA). He wasn't too bad of a hitter either with a 94 wRC+, and he's got some pop with an above average 7.8% barrel% and 89 MPH EV. He's not particularly good on defense, the 24.2/6.1 K%/BB% isn't good, he's already basically 32 years old, and he hits lefties much better than righties, so he's likely a speedy 4th outfielder/pinch runner, but if he does get on the field, he will make a fantasy impact. - 2025 Projection: 41/6/28/.256/.313/.402/28

213) Davis Schneider - TOR, 2B/OF, 26.2 - Schnedier wasn't able to back up his impressive rookie season. His hit tool tanked with a .191 BA and 31.7% K%. He played a solid 2B, but there isn't much defensive value there either. The poor sophomore season now puts him in a battle with sooooooo many similarly talented fringy type players in Toronto. The thing that keeps him ranked even this high is that he still put up an excellent 12% Barrel%, so the power potential is in here if he can improve the hit tool. The 21.4 degree launch with a 88.6/93.1 MPH FB/EV ensure he will hit dingers, but it also looks like a recipe for an extremely low BA. I was all for taking a shot on Schneider coming off his excellent rookie season, but it didn't really pan out. He's a bench bat who could be useful if he works his way into a full time job, but that isn't a very unique profile. - 2025 Projection: 41/13/44/.221/.312/.416/5

214) Ezequiel Duran - TEX, 3B/OF, 25.10 - I loved Duran in 2023 and into the off-season, and while I was worried about his playing time, I wasn't worried about his talent. It turns out I should have been worried about both as his quality of contact dropped off a cliff in 2024. His Barrel% went from 8.7% to 3.4%, his EV dropped from 90.1 MPH to 87.1 MPH, and his launch dropped from 14.0 degrees to 8.9 degrees. It resulted in a 74 wRC+, 3 homers, and a 1 steal in 285 PA. He swings a quick bat with an above average 72.6 MPH swing speed and he's very fast with a 28.8 ft/sec sprint, so it's not like I was imagining things loving him so much. And his contact rates improved with an average 22.1% K% and 24.7% whiff%. But both the underlying and surface stats numbers were terrible in 2024, and he clearly doesn't have a starting job, or probably a next man up job either, so he's no longer target. He remains on the radar though, and that swing speed tells me he should be able to do better in 2025. 2025 Projection: 31/8/28/.255/.300/.400/5

215) Nelson Velazquez - KCR, OF, 26.3 - Velazquez couldn't back up his 2023 breakout, and it resulted in him getting sent down to the minors in June after putting up a .200 BA with only 8 homers in 64 games. Not only did the hit tool tank him, but the power was way down too with a 8.8% Barrel% (21.4% in 2023). He's now out of a job and will have to hit his way back into one, but because KC's outfield is so wide open, there is opportunity for him to do it. - 2025 Projection: 34/11/35/.225/.301/.417/4

216) Alek Thomas - ARI, OF, 24.11 - I wouldn't write Thomas off from winning that starting CF job in Arizona, which is holding me back from liking Jake McCarthy more. Thomas has plus contact rates with a 16.5% K%, he hits the ball very hard with a 91.2/96.0 MPH AVG/FB EV, and he has above average speed with a 27.8 ft/sec sprint. Good things tend to happen on a baseball field when you have that trifecta of skills, and while good things haven't happened for Thomas in the majors with a career .226 BA, I have to think that is majorly unlucky. He put up a .278 xBA in 2024 vs. a .189 BA in 39 games. That is a major discrepancy. With how often he's underperformed the xBA, you can't say it's all unlucky, but I have a hard time believing that a large portion of it isn't. The launch is terrible at 1 degree and he doesn't run nearly enough, so he's not a great fantasy target himself, he's just more of a thorn in McCarthy's side. - 2025 Projection: 42/8/39/.245/.298/.395/9

217) Cooper Bowman - CIN, 2B/OF, 25.2 - The Reds selected Bowman 7th overall in the Rule 5 Draft, which gives him a leg up on an Opening Day roster spot, and it seems like he could be next man up at several positions for them now. And if he does get pushed into full time action, he has the base running ability to make a fantasy impact with 43 steals in 118 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The Athletics left him unprotected for a reason, and that reason is that the hit/power combo probably isn't good enough to be a true MLB starter. He hit 0 homers with a 80.5 MPH EV, 24.3/7.9 K%, .218 BA and 48 wRC+ in 38 games at Triple-A. Granted he hit much better at Double-A with 12 homers, a 20.2/12.4 K%/BB% and a 138 wRC+ in 80 games, but at 24 years old, he's already too old to be taking his upper minors numbers fully seriously. I see some similarities with David Hamilton, and like Hamilton, if Bowman gets the at bats, the steals should keep him afloat in fantasy. - 2025 Projection: 38/6/31/.232/.304/.379/16

218) Jonatan Clase - TOR, OF, 22.10 - There were points where I really liked Clase, and only 22 years old, maybe I shouldn't be so quick to cool on him, but the warts in his profile are starting to take forefront in my mind. He doesn't hit the ball hard with an 85.8 MPH EV at AAA and 0 Barrels in his 66 PA MLB debut, and at a small 5'10'', it's hard to expect a lot more there. He's also had contact issues his entire career with a 26% K% at AAA and a 25.8% K% in the majors. And lastly, he has a below average 70.7 MPH swing which is even worse from the left side with a 69.3 MPH swing (the side he swings with more often). He's also not particularly great on defense. He has elite speed and base running ability, which makes him so fun for fantasy, but I think a bench OF is his most likely role. At only 22, maybe he can make improvements to the power, defense, and hit tool, which is why I don't want to write him off completely, but I'm just not too excited by him anymore. - 2025 Projection: 25/3/21/.228/.292/.360/9 Prime Projection: 63/10/41/.249/.319/.391/24

219) Alan Roden - TOR, OF, 25.3 - Roden projects as a solid across the board corner outfielder, but he's already 25 years old, and with how high the offensive bar is for a corner outfielder, I'm not sure Roden's bat is quite good enough to clear that bar. Having said that, the guy has done nothing but rake in the minors, and he had another great year in 2024, slashing .293/.391/.475 with 16 homers, 14 steals, and a 14.2/12.1 K%/BB% in 125 games in the upper minors. He doesn't hit the ball particularly hard (87.6 MPH EV), he's not a burner, and he doesn't lift it a ton (7.4 degree launch). He's also going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.251/.312/.392/2 Prime Projection: 66/14/62/.269/.328/.414/10

220) Luis Lara - MIL, OF, 20.4 - Lara is your typical little guy (5'7'') contact/speed play with a 15.7% K% and 45 steals in 110 games at High-A. There isn't much hope for more power coming with only 4 homers, and the 95 wRC+ is underwhelming, but he was very young for the level. I had hope that he could be one of the higher end versions of this profile, but after the lackluster season, he just wasn't able to separate himself from the pack. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/8/47/.267/.321/.374/26

221) Kendall George - LAD, OF, 20.5 - George lived up to his billing as a contact/speed play after getting drafted 36th overall in 2023, slashing .279/.384/.328 with 1 homer, 36 steals, and a 20.5/14.1 K%/BB% in 86 games at Single-A. The reason he doesn't rank higher is because that power output is true bottom of the scale, the 20.5% K% is higher than optimal, and he got caught 12 times on the bases. Usually with these types I want to see truly elite contact rates or potential for legit power, and it doesn't seem like George has either of those right now. Still a good speed first prospect though. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/6/45/.267/.330/.369/31

222) Lisbel Diaz - SFG, OF, 19.8 - Diaz is a big physical dude at 6'2'', 201 pounds, and he's hit everywhere he's been, including in full season ball as a 18 year old in 2024. He slashed .279/.333/.433 with 6 homers, 8 steals, and a 18.8/5.5 K%/BB% in 55 games at the level. This coming off a 138 wRC+ in 22 games at stateside rookie earlier in the year, and a 124 wRC+ in 22 games in the DSL in 2023. He needs to learn how to lift the ball more to get to his pretty considerable raw power with about 50% groundball rates, but he mitigates that a bit by pulling it over 50% of the time, and he's a good athlete for his size too. The approach isn't great and there are some hit tool concerns, but Diaz is legitimately exciting. He's definitely underrated. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 68/20/76/.251/.317/.428/9

223) Edward Florentino - PIT, 1B/OF, 18.5 - Florentino is a big dude at 6'4'', 200 pounds, and he signed for a not bad $395,000 in last year's international class. He played a bunch of CF along with 1B, so while his glove isn't expected to be an asset, he could end up a solid corner outfielder. And of course, we are buying the bat here with big raw power and excellent production in his pro debut in the DSL. He slashed .260/.432/.459 with 5 homers, 8 steals, and a 18.9/20.0 K%/BB% in 49 games. He put the ball in the air a ton with a 30.5% GB%. He's setting up to be your classic three true outcome slugger. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/26/83/.246/.328/.453/6

224) Justin Gonzales - BOS, 1B/OF, 18.3 - Like Florentio, Gonzales is a big dude at 6'4'', 210 pounds, and he signed for $250,000 in last year's international class despite limited defensive value. That means the Red Sox liked his bat a lot, and I'm sure they like it even more after his excellent pro debut in the DSL, slashing .320/.391/.517 with 5 homers, 8 steals, and a 10.4/9.9 K%/BB% in 47 games. He hit the ball on the ground too much to fully get to his big raw power, but his contact/power combo is impressive. Obviously so much risk with DSL guys and lack of defensive value, but the upside on the bat is good enough to slot in here. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 74/22/81/.266/.326/.447/6

225) Teilon Serrano - MIN, OF, 16.10 - Betting on Serrano was just as big of a bet on the Dodgers as it was on Serrano, so I can't say I like him as much with the Twins as I did with the Dodgers (the Dodgers had to decommit to him after signing Roki). But I still love me a prospect with such a visually fast and explosive swing at 6'0'', 185 pounds. Combine that with double plus speed and I think he could have some of the best speed first upside in this class. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 83/16/64/.259/.328/.413/30

226) Royel Strop - STL, OF, 16.10 - Strop has baseball bloodlines with his father, Pedro Strop, just finishing his MLB reliever career in 2021. And now his father is turning to the training/coaching game as he coached his son, Royel, to be one of the best international prospects in the class. Strop is a strong and still projectable 6'1'', 165 pounds, and he has a controlled and powerful lefty swing that is geared for both power and average. Tack on plus speed, and you have a very enticing international prospect. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 78/18/69/.265/.328/.426/18

227) Maykel Coret - TBR, OF, 17.6 - Coret has one of the highest upsides in the class at 6'4'', 190 pounds with a potentially plus power/speed combo. The swing is athletic and powerful, and while it's not the shortest swing, I like that he's trying to do real damage. He can already hit the ball very hard. He's also an excellent athlete who certainly looks the part on the field with smooth and explosive movements. If the hit tool is at least solid in the DSL, he definitely has potential to get some real hype very quickly. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/25/81/.254/.329/.453/21

228) Brendan Tunink - LAD, OF, 19.6 - Selected 250th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Tunink is a high upside high schooler drafted by the Dodgers. That is an excellent foundation right there. He's a strong 6'0'', 185 pounds with an absolutely vicious lefty swing that is looking to do damage, and it's a short and controlled swing too. He combines that with plus speed and a good feel to hit. This is a bet on the Dodgers just as much as it's a bet on Tunink. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/17/68/.252/.321/.421/17

229) Jakob Christian - SFG, OF, 22.6 - Selected 149th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Christian is 6'5'', 225 pounds with big power and good athleticism. I love betting on a big dude who is also a good athlete, and while Christian has plenty of flaws, there is plenty to like for fantasy. He's done nothing but rip homers in his college career starting from his freshman year, crushing 67 homers in 160 career games. He definitely has hit tool risk, but a 20% K% isn't too bad, and he was good in his pro debut, slashing .267/.378/.500 with 1 homer and a 21.6/13.5 K%/BB% in 9 games at Single-A.. He's a high risk, high reward power hitting college bat. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 58/16/66/.233/.301/.429/6

230) Kavares Tears - SDP, OF, 22.7 - Selected 134th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Tears is proven SEC power bat with hit tool risk. He's a strong 6'0'' with a powerful lefty swing that is made to do damage. He cracked 20 homers in 71 games at Tennessee. He's also a good athlete with some speed, and while he's not a huge base stealer, he should still contribute a handful. The problem is that it came with a 25.3% K%, and while the 15.4% BB% mitigates that a bit, it's still not good. His bat has a high bar to clear as a mostly corner outfielder, and you can see by him getting drafted 134th overall, teams aren't fully convinced he can clear it. He's still worth the shot late in first player drafts if you want a good college bat rather than a 17 year old mystery. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/18/74/.240/.314/.420/7

231) Kyle Isbel - KCR, OF, 28.1 - Isbel should be a 4th outfielder, but KC doesn't have any other good options, so he seems like the main guy for the CF job. He's an above average CF, but he's not even that good there where his glove needs to get him on the field. And he's a bad hitter with a 81 wRC+ in 136 games, and a 77 wRC+ in his 361 game career. He's not a big base stealer either with only 11 steals in 2024, so you can't even bank on that. He has a job, and that is about it. - 2025 Projection: 54/7/46/.236/.294/.375/12

232) Javier Sanoja - MIA, OF/SS/2B, 22.7 - Sanoja can play basically every position on the field, and Miami's corner outfield spots are pretty wide open, so there seems to be plenty of opportunity for him to rack up at bats. He had elite contact rates in the minors which transferred to the majors with a 11.1% K% in 36 PA, and he's got speed with a 28.7 ft/sec sprint and 17 steals in 126 games in the upper minors. He doesn't hit the ball hard (84.6 MPH EV in the minors), and as you saw from that steal total, he doesn't really run enough for this type of profile. He's a utility player on the vast majority of teams, but with Miami, he's liable to get 500+ PA. - 2025 Projection: 38/4/36/.245/.297/.338/12

233) Homer Bush Jr. - TBR, OF, 23.5 - Bush was a college bat who didn't exactly dominate High-A with a 111 wRC+ in 86 games, but he doesn't have the type of profile to dominate a level. He's the type where he can do what he does regardless of the competition, which is run like wild (57 steals) and get the bat on the ball (18.8/9.3 K%/BB%). He's 6'2'', 200 pounds, so he has the size to add more power, but it's really not a big part of his game with 6 homers. He's likely a part time player, but with his speed, he's a part time player that can make an impact. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 71/8/42/.258/.321/.391/28

234) Robert Hassell – WAS, OF, 23.8 - Hassell hasn't lived up to his draft promise as the 8th overall pick in the draft, and now it seems likely that he's a 4th outfielder. After putting up an 85 wRC+ at mostly Double-A in 2023, he followed that up with a 87 wRC+ in 2024 at mostly that same level. He doesn't hit for power (5 homers), he doesn't steal a ton of bases (15 steals in 85 games), and the contact rates aren't that great either (21% K%). He cracks this list for pedigree and proximity. - ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 44/8/39/.242/.311/.389/13

235) Grant McCray - SFG, OF, 24.4 - McCray is really testing the limits on how much I lean power/speed over hit tool. That hit tool is as brutal as it gets with a 43.1/4.6 K%/BB% in 37 games, and I just can't overlook that. He's an elite athlete with a 29.2 ft/sec sprint and an 11.8% Barrel% (90.2 MPH EV), which led to 5 homer and 5 steals in those 37 games, but even I can't just gloss over the hit tool risk. Then tack on ballpark risk and the fact he's not a big launch guy, and I just can't get behind this. He's an upside true last pick flier. - 2025 Projection: 29/7/26/.218/.284/.395/9

236) Dillon Head - MIA, OF, 20.6 - Head's season ended after just 26 games due to a hip injury that required surgery. He wasn't all that impressive before the injury either, slashing .243/.317/.396 with 2 homers, 5 steals, and a 24.4/8.1 K%/BB% at Single-A. Considering he's supposed to be a hit/speed guy, neither the contact rates nor the stolen base totals are where you wanted them to be. He was a first round pick in 2023 and I liked him a lot coming out of the draft, so I don't want to completely write him off, but this was a rough start to his career. He needs to prove himself in 2025 to start climbing back up the rankings again. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 61/10/53/.251/.319/.406/16

237) Harold Rivas - BOS, OF, 16.11 - Rivas is visually super explosive at the dish with an athletic and powerful righty swing that definitely has power potential as he continues to fill out his 6'2'', 170 pound frame. He's also a plus runner who plays a good CF. The hit tool isn't bulletproof, and he's not necessarily the broadest guy, but he's on the young side for the class, so who knows how his body ends up. Either way, he's got the power/speed combo we like for fantasy, so the upside is definitely in here. - ETA: 2023 Prime Projection: 74/18/63/.248/.313/.427/22

238) Diego Tornes - ATL, OF, 16.9 - Tornes is one of the youngest players in the class but he's also already one of the most physically mature at 6'4'', 200 pounds. This is a big boy already with big boy power from a quick and powerful swing. He's a switch who hits better lefty than righty, and he's a good athlete despite his already impressive size. He has some of the best power upside in the class. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 74/25/83/.250/.320/.450/9

239) Darwin Ozuna - OAK, OF, 17.0 - Ozuna has big time power upside at a broad and still projectable 6'3'', 195 pounds with a powerful righty swing that already does damage. He's a good athlete but he's not a burner, and there are some hit tool questions, so it's a power first profile with some risk. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 68/23/77/.245/.317/.446/8

240) Seth Brown - OAK, 1B/OF, 32.9 - Brown is in a strong side of a platoon role, but I think his time is coming up on even that. He's not a good defensive player, he's going to turn 33 during the season, and he put up his 2nd straight season with a 91 wRC+. That isn't a starter. He still hits the ball hard with a 90 MPH EV, which can keep him relevant, but the contact rates and plate approach are poor. It's time to give the kids a shot. - 2025 Projection: 35/12/41/.228/.290/.419/4

241) Griffin Conine - MIA, OF, 27.8 - Conine seems to have a path to playing time in Miami at the moment, although he'll have plenty of other fringy competition, and he can definitely hit some dingers if given the opportunity. He cracked 19 homers with an 89.9 MPH EV in 112 games at Triple-A, and then he cracked 3 homers with a 114 wRC+ in 89 PA in the majors. He got lucky in the majors with a .289 xwOBA, the hit tool is terrible (31.5/6.7 K%/BB%) and he's already 27 years old, so he's a bench power bat at best. But as long as he has opportunity, he deserves to sneak on this list. - 2025 Projection: 29/10/34/.220/.297/.409/1

242) Pedro Leon - HOU, OF, 26.10 - Leon cracks this list basically solely for that 77.8 MPH swing in his MLB debut. And also for the 24 homers and 29 steals in 118 games at Triple-A. And also for the opportunity in Houston's OF. He's 26 years old and the hit tool probably isn't good enough to be a starter with a 27.0/8.1 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 47.6% K% in 21 PA in the majors, so he's merely a deep league flier. - 2025 Projection: 16/4/13/.210/.283/.374/6 Prime Projection: 33/8/36/.222/.298/.391/8

243) Bo Davidson - SFG, OF, 22.9 - Davidson put up a 173 wRC+ in 53 games at Single-A, but considering he was already 21/22 years old, it isn't quite as impressive. He can hit the ball hard at 6'1'', 205 pounds, leading to 9 homers at the level, but a 48.4% GB% and 35.5% Pull% isn't conducive to big homer totals long term, and neither is his eventual home ballpark. He's not a great base stealer (6 steals in 9 attempts), and the 23.9% K% is on the high side. He's a good athlete who can play CF, and he comes from the Junior college level, so maybe there could be some more developmental upside than his age would indicate. I'm just not seeing big fantasy upside here, but that doesn't mean there is nothing to like. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 55/14/55/.252/.321/.418/8

244) Gabriel Gonzalez - MIN, OF, 21.3 - Gonzalez had an underwhelming year in 2024, slashing .255/.326/.381 with 5 homers, 5 steals, and a 14.5/6.8 K%/BB% in 81 games at High-A. The contact rates were still good, but the power/speed numbers were very lackluster, and as a maxed out corner outfielder, it's not looking like a starting profile right now. He's hit for more power in the past, and he gets the bat on the ball, so I want to give him one more year before dropping him off this list. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 48/13/56/.257/.320/.417/4

245) Samuel Zavala - CHW, OF, 20.8 - Zavala was a straight disaster in 2024, slashing .187/.340/.301 with 8 homers, 14 steals, and a 22.3/17.8 K%/BB% in 111 games, but I don't want to write him off completely quite yet. He's always been very young for the level, and he continued to show the mature plate approach that was his bread and butter. He's 6'1'', 175 pounds, so there is room for him to tack on more muscle, and he doesn't have any issues lifting and pulling it. Simply getting stronger and playing against people his own age could go a long way. I'm giving him one more year. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 56/13/49/.248/.324/.412/9

246) Hector Rodriguez - CIN, OF, 21.1 - Rodriguez generally hits everywhere he's been, and while he hit well again this year, it was a bit more underwhelming with a 106 wRC+, 12 homers, and 12 steals in 125 games at High-A. He's not a big guy at 5'10'', and while the 13.3% K% is excellent, the 4.8% BB% isn't. He's likely a utility player long term. ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/10/51/.262/.313/.395/10

247) Ching-Hsien Ko - LAD, OF, 18.7 - The Dodgers signed Ko mid-season like they did with Hyun-seok Jang the year before, which kept the hype in check, but they signed him for $750,000, so they obviously like him. He only played in the 9 games in the DSL, but he played well in those games with 1 homer, 1 steal, a 17.5/27.5 K%/BB%, and a 150 wRC+. He was a strong international performer as well in tournaments, so there is some history of production here. And he most certainly looks the part at 6'3'', 215 pounds. He profiles as a potentially big power hitter with a strong plate approach, but clearly he has a lot to prove. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 74/23/77/.255/.335/.445/7

248) Nick McLain - CHW, OF, 22.4 - How could I not put little Matty McLain's little brother, Nicky McLain, on this list. The McLain's are not big people (Nick is also 5'10''), but they are damn good baseball players. Nick was selected 78th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft coming off a very productive college career in the Pac 12. He slashed .342/.457/.663 with 12 homers, 6 steals, and a 11.7/14.4 K%/BB% in 48 games his junior year. He's not quite as good of an athlete as his brother with an average power/speed combo, and he's a corner outfielder, so if he wasn't a McLain, he might not have cracked this list. But plus bloodlines matter, and he has then. And he also has a good feel to hit. So I wouldn't bet against him becoming a solid all around baseball player, it just might come as a bench bat. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 65/14/59/.258/.319/.413/8

249) Casey Saucke - CHW, OF, 21.8 - Selected 107th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, Saucke was a big time major conference performer his entire career, culminating in a junior year where he slashed .344/.407/.578 with 14 homers, 9 steals, and a 18.2/9.5 K%/BB% in 62 games in the ACC. He also  looks the part at a rock solid 6'3'', 210 pounds with a pretty athletic and controlled righty swing. He's a corner outfielder, and the bat probably isn't going to be good enough to clear that bar, which is why he lasted until 107th overall, but the size and production are there, so there is some potential here to become an impact fantasy bat if it all works out. He's also very young for the class, and he hit decently at the age appropriate High-A with a 110 wRC+, 2 homers, 2 steals, and a 26.3/6.1 K%/BB% in 24 games. - ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 41/12/46/.238/.301/.413/5

250) Eli Lovich - CHC, OF, 19.7 - Selected 332nd overall in the 2024 MLB Draft but signing $650K, Lovich has the size (6'4''), projection (a skinny-ish 185 pounds), and athleticism (above average speed) you look for in an enticing fantasy prospect. He can already hit the ball hard, and while the swing isn't really all that smooth or pretty, it's definitely fast and powerful. There could be hit tool issues in here, but there is upside as well. - ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 62/16/66/.244/.315/.426/7

251) Mike Tauchman - CHW, OF, 34.3 - Tauchman seems to have a starting job with Chicago, but he'll have some competition from minor leaguers as the season progresses, so he's far from locked into that job. He does have the hitting talent to hold those kids off though coming off his 2nd straight season putting up a pretty impressive xwOBA. He put up a .345 xwOBA in 2023 and a .330 xwOBA in 2024. The 20.0/13.4 K%/BB% is strong and he hits it pretty hard with a 89 MPH EV. Even in those years the fantasy upside was extremely limited with about a .250 BA, 15 homers, and 13 steals in 751 PA combined, so it's an extremely low end win now option, and he's going to be 34 years old. - 2025 Projection: 53/8/41/.247/.342/.370/6

252) Yasser Mercedes - MIN, OF, 20.5 - Mercedes destroyed stateside rookie ball with a 163 wRC+, but he was already 19 years old, and when he got to the age appropriate Single-A, he fell apart with a 37.5% K% and 41 wRC+ in 10 games. It's fair to give him more time to adjust to a new level regardless of age, and he's a toolsy prospect with power (6 homers in 61 games overall) and speed (21 steals) at 6'1'', 175 pounds. He's a mid 20's breakout type prospect. It's going to be a slow burn, but the upside is worth a spot at the back of the rankings.  ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 58/14/58/.234/.306/.418/16

253) Stiven Martinez - BAL, OF, 17.8 - The 6'3'', 198 pound Martinez cracked my Top 1,000 last off-season on the back of his impressive power potential, and while there were some positives and negatives from his pro debut in the DSL, the 137 wRC+ is good enough to crack this list again in 2025. He slashed .278/.417/.466 with 4 homers, 2 steals, and a 30.4/16.7 K%/BB% in 41 games. The K rates is too high to go too crazy here, but he's still only 17 years old, and he's an impressive athlete. He's still a high upside lotto ticket. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 67/23/76/.241/.320/.433/8

254) Robert Arias - CLE, OF, 18.6 - Arias' 102 wRC+ with 0 homers in 41 games in the DSL doesn't jump off the screen, but his double plus speed most certainly does with 29 steals, and so do the elite contact rates with a 8.3/13.9 K%/BB%. He's a projectable 6'1'' with the potential to reach average power at peak, so as the raw power grows naturally, he could end up one of the top contact/speed plays coming out of the DSL this year. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 76/13/58/.263/.327/.392/29

255) Jose Anderson - MIL, OF, 18.4 - Anderson was one of the top DSL performers, slashing .283/.403/.512 with 8 homers, 14 steals, and a 18.9/14.4 K%/BB% in 46 games. It was good for a 143 wRC+. He wasn't a high priced international signing, but Milwaukee does absolutely elite work in this market, so you have to trust the organization there, and it's not like Anderson doesn't have talent. He can hit the ball hard, he can lift it, and he can pull it. He's also a good athlete who plays CF and can steal some bags. He's not one of those diminutive breakouts either at a solid 6'0'', 183 pounds. He's one to at least keep an eye on in 2025 as he comes stateside. ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 71/18/68/.250/.320/.425/14

256) Carlos Renzullo - COL, 2B/OF, 18.6 - Renzullo is one of the top hit/speed breakouts in the DSL, slashing .360/.455/.447 with 1 homer, 18 steals, and a 6.0%/14.0% K%/BB% in 50 games. There isn't big power here at 5'8'' with high groundball rates, and often with these types the hit tool will just keeping getting a bit worse at every level, leaving them with a pretty lackluster speed and not much else profile. But if you want to take a shot on a DSL contact/speed play, Renzullo is not a bad shot. - ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 72/9/55/.273/.328/.385/27

257) Elian De La Cruz - ARI, OF, 17.6 - Cruz checks plenty of the international prospect boxes. He's projectable at 6'1'', 180 pounds, he has a quick righty swing, he has a good feel to hit, and he has speed. Nothing particularly stands out too much, but he definitely has the talent to pop with a strong showing in the DSL. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/17/67/.250/.320/.418/18

258) Carlos Taveras - MIN, OF, 16.10 - Taveras has a smooth and controlled lefty swing that is geared for both power and average, and at 6'1'', 213 pounds, it's not hard to envision a potent hit/power combo at peak. He's also a good runner despite his size, so this is a good athlete too. The swing isn't super explosive and he's not quite as generally explosive as a lot of the other kids in this class, but he's a still a good one. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 81/20/76/.267/.333/.440/10

259) Kenly Hunter - STL, OF, 16.11 - Hunter has a history of production against international competition, he has a good feel to hit, he's got speed, and he's projectable at 6'0'', 160 pounds. I can't find video on him, but that seems to be a pretty good floor/upside combo, and one worthy of being on the radar. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/15/61/.268/.324/.409/21

260) Ruben Castillo - NYY, OF, 17.3 - Castillo has a damn smooth and powerful lefty swing that is fun to watch, and while he's not a huge guy, there is definitely power projection at 6'0'', 165 pounds. He also has a good feel to hit and speed, giving him plenty of ingredients to be a quick performer in the DSL. - ETA: 2030 Prime Projection: 76/18/71/.263/.323/.427/18

*Free agents like Alex Verdugo, Harrison Bader, Tommy Pham and others will be included into this list if they are able to land full time jobs (or anything close to full time jobs). I'm not including them now because they really aren't good enough to be starters anymore, but we'll see as there are some bad outfielders with jobs at the moment, so they could land one
